Sun

17
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:25,001
这个芭蕾舞女是你打碎的吗?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,039
那是谁干的?

19
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,083
是女仆干的

20
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:35,000
如果你说是女仆干的...

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,061
我会炒了她鱿鱼

22
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:40,017
你懂吗?

23
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,010
Sun

24
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,023
是谁打碎的?

25
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:50,016
是女仆干的

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,025
很好

27
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,056
Sun...开门

28
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:16,042
我很好

29
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:18,094
只是有点晕吐

30
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,027
Jin...等等

31
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:37,073
我丈夫说该回去了

32
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,039
他认为Jack他们不会来了
He doesn't think Jack and the others are coming.

33
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,047
烟已经点燃一天多了
It's been over a day since we lit the fire.

34
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,089
他们应该早来了

35
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:46,076
Jack知道我们在这里
Jack knows we're out here.

36
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:50,017
他就指望我们了
He's counting on our signal.

37
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,081
也许他们看不到黑烟
Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke.

38
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:02,019
如果他在我们北面  山会把他们视线挡住
If he's north of us, the mountains would block his view.

39
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:07,097
我们得继续开船沿着岸走 找个不会被山挡住的地方另点黑烟
We need to sail forward along the coast,Clear
 the mountains and start another signal fire.

40
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:12,061
不
No

41
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,036
我答应Jack我们会点起黑烟的
I told Jack I would light a fire.

42
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:18,077
我不会食言
I'm not abandoning him.

43
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,045
Sayid说...

44
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:22,090
我们哪也不去

45
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,008
Sayid不是你的丈夫

46
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:41,003
我丈夫说我们得听他的 因为他是唯一一个知道怎么开船的
My husband thinks we have to do as 
he says,Because he's the only one who knows how to sail.

47
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,040
但是他错了
But he's wrong.

48
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:49,071
我可以帮你开船
I can help you sail the boat.

49
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:11,085
感觉好点了么?
Are you feeling any better?

50
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:23,075
这汤是我自己弄的 如果你不喜欢的话也没办法
I made the soup myself,but I won't take it the wrong way if you don't like it.

51
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:58,040
你从没给我做过汤喝
You never made soup for me.

52
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:03,044
打扰你们了吗?
Am I interrupting something?

53
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:06,099
打不打扰有关系吗?
Would it really matter if you were?

54
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,070
有情况了
We have a situation.

55
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,007
Brian报告说
Brian radioed in.

56
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,085
那个伊拉克人发现了诱敌的村落了

00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,060

Brian跟着他去了岸边
Brian followed him back to the shore.

60

Ben  他们有艘帆船
Ben, they have a sailboat.

61
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:21,020
- 怎么弄到的?  - 我不知道
- How? - I have no idea.

62
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,010
就是说他们有艘船了
So they have a boat.

63
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,079
开着船绕圈可够他们忙的了
Sailing in circles will keep them busy.

64
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,089
他们会发现我们
They could find us.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,023
- Ben... - 我在考虑
- Ben... - I'm thinking.

66

00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:41,062
那就别浪费时间了

嘿  Colleen

00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,091
我得调整方向

81
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:53,098
我很抱歉  Jin

82
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:57,042
我不应该和你作对

83
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:00,009
特别是在Sayid面前

84
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:04,074
你确实不应该和我作对  在这期间

85
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,091
Sun

86
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:14,029

00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:24,095
我不想失去你

89
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:39,037
怎么了?
What's wrong?

90
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:44,070
因为我有丈夫了
What's wrong is I'm married.

91
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,055
是的

但我不能戴着它...

101
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:33,085

102
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:37,091
我不想再和别人分享你了

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,006
先生

109
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:08,028
我很抱歉  我不知道...

你把它们挖松一点 你就负责把它们拉走
You're gonna chop 'em loose,and you're gonna haul 'em outta here.

你就让我这么穿着干活?
You expect me to work in this dress?

116

随你便了

117
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,083
你愿意的话可以脱下来
You can take it off if you want.

118
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,039
你敢?
How dare you?

119
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,040
如果你们需要什么  举手
Now if you need anything, you raise your hand.

120
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,075
- 你们有10分钟吃午饭... - 我有个问题  老板

就算她问了又怎么样?

125
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:22,025
- 我们没有被警告的机会吗? - 电击  我是说电击
-Don't we even get a warning? -Shocked. I said shocked.

你们互相讲话  就会被电击
If you talk to each other, you'll be shocked.

在看到Jack之前我什么也不做
I'm not doing anything until I see Jack.

132
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,049
那只是四分之一的电量
Now that was a quarter charge.

133
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:51,076
还有问题吗?
You got any more questions?

134
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:06,000
一旦你有力气了 手推车就在那里
Soon as you're able to walk, wheelbarrow's right over there.

135
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:19,000

136
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,096
进来

137
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:24,066
请坐

138
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,090
我们有麻烦了

139
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,064
这个人偷了我的东西

140
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:44,061
我要你去了结了他

141
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:46,090
他偷了什么?

142
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,059
这不重要

143
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,048
当然了

144
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,021
我会和他说的

145
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:57,034
说说有什么用

146
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:00,091
我要你去了结了他

147
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:04,088
我不能那么做

148
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:06,095
你当然可以

149
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:10,034
先生  这不是我的工作...

150
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:13,066
你的工作就是照我说的做

151
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:20,060
那我就不能再为你工作了

152
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,090
我辞职

153
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:27,022
你不会辞职的

154
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:31,057
这个人使我蒙羞

155
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:37,035
你娶了我的女儿  Jin

156
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:45,099
那你就是我儿子了

157
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,023
我的羞耻就是你的羞耻

158
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:07,012
我需要你去夺回我们家的尊严

159
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:42,004
那怎么会有一个码头?
Why should there be a dock all the way out here?

160
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,005
其他人
Others.

161
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:45,042
码头已经腐朽了
The dock's decaying.

162
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:46,072
杂草丛生
It's overgrown.

163
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:49,020
看起来很久没人用了
It looks like it hasn't been used in quite some time.

164
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,015
不管是谁建的  肯定都不在了
Whoever built it, they're not here now.

165
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:53,094
把船开过去
Let's bring the boat in.

166
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:56,016
绑在码头上  我们在海滩上生烟
We'll tie to the dock and build a fire on the beach.

167
00:14:56,016 --> 00:15:02,079
这里可见性很好  Jack很远就可以看到
The visibility's excellent,And Jack will be able to see us from miles around.

168
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,035
安全么?
Safe?

169
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,054
是的  Jin
Yes, Jin.

170
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:12,029
这里当然安全
Of course it's safe.

171
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:41,045
回去干活
Get back to work.

172
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:48,037
听你的  老板
Whatever you say, boss.

173
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,051
小心点
Careful.

174
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:12,028
别让他们看到我在和你说话
Don't let them see you talking to me.

175
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:17,081
他们把你们关在笼子里吗?
Are they keeping you in the cages?

176
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:20,019
你还看到有别人吗?
Did you see another guy in there with you?

177
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,032
和我差不多大  叫Karl的
About my age, named Karl?

178
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:23,080
没有
No.

179
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,043
那里只有我和Sawyer
It's just Sawyer and me.

180
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:30,024
你们不应该被关在那里的
You're not even supposed to be in that cage.

181
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:32,042
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

182
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:35,040
你是谁?
Who are you?

183
00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:39,067
那件衣服哪来的?
Where'd you get that dress?

184
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:42,003
他们给我的
They gave it to me.

185
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:44,063
这是我的衣服
It's mine.

186
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:46,088
就给你吧
You can keep it.

187
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,014
你穿上比较好看
It looks better on you anyway.

188
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:51,031
等等
Wait. Wait.

189
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,055
很开心吗  小妞?
Having fun yet, freckles?

190
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,053
别老盯着我的屁股
Quit staring at my ass.

191
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,043
那就给别的让我看啊
Give me something else to stare at.

192
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:08,006
闭嘴
Shut up!

193
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,082
好的  老板
Yes, sir, boss.

194
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,052
谢谢
Thank you.

195
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,045
我还能做什么?
What else can I do?

196
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:25,078
去帮你的丈夫
Help your husband.

197
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,059
我们还需要很多木头
We need as much wood as we can find.

198
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:32,046
我们生的烟可够大的了
We're building quite a large fire.

199
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:36,025
我们得确信Jack会看到黑烟
We have to make sure Jack will see the smoke.

200
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,099
你为什么骗我  Sayid?
Why are you lying to me, Sayid?

201
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:48,087
你知道我骗了你什么  Sun?
And what would you know about lying, Sun?

202
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:56,042
你让我们冒生命危险
You're putting our lives in danger.

203
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:02,062
我很确信我们的朋友被抓了
I'm fairly certain our friends have been captured.

204
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:06,018
码头上都是足印
There are tracks all over the dock.

205
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,060
痕迹还很新  差不多是昨天的
They're fresh, as recent as yesterday.

206
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,005
你说过这个码头被闲置了
You said this dock was abandoned.

207
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:15,026
那也是一个谎言
That would be part of the lying you mentioned.

208
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:20,065
你不是为了我们的人而生烟
You're not building this fire for our people.

209
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,064
你是为了他们
You're building it for the others.

210
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:28,052
我想当他们看到烟后  会派一支调查队来
I suspect that when they see the 
smoke, they'll send a scout party to investigate.

211
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:30,038
到那时已经是晚上了
By then it will be night.

212
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:32,068
当他们靠近  我们就伏击他们
When they arrive, I'll ambush them.

213
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:35,068
我会抓两个当人质  其余的都杀了
I'll take two of them hostage, and I'll kill the rest.

214
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:37,058
两个?
Two?

215
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:41,058
一个用来使他们和我们合作
One to make the other cooperate.

216
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:48,030
你要我怎么做?
What do you need me to do?

217
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:54,003
我很抱歉  但我需要你再瞒Jin二十分钟
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you
 to lie to Jin for another 20 minutes.

218
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,069
为什么?
Why?

219
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:04,026
因为一旦火点起来了  要回去就太迟了
Because once the fire is lit, it will be too late to go back.

220
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:21,042
你回来了

221
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:47,024
今天过得怎样?

222
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:52,062
还不错

223
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:58,029
我去见你父亲了

224
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,083
是么?

225
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,097
他第一次叫我"儿子"

226
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:10,075
他为什么这么做?

227
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,000
他要我去传个消息

228
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:23,016
你会去做吗?

229
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:26,004
我不得不去

230
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:27,082
不  Jin

231
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:30,017
你不会去的

232
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:36,051
你认为有这么简单吗?

233
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,081
我们...

234
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:44,054
可以开始新生活

235
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:45,063
我们离开...

236
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:47,058
新生活?

237
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:49,000
如果我们离开  你的父亲会...

238
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,027
他不会知道我们在哪里的

239
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,072
你就不用老做这些事了

240
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,056
你不用...

241
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,058
我都是为了你  Sun

242
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,091
我这么做是因为你父亲希望我这么做

243
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,022
我这么做是因为...

244
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:10,024
这样做才能娶到你

245
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:14,006
那我到底做了什么才会嫁给你

246
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:21,003
Jin

247
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:25,052
你去哪?

248
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:31,073
去传达消息

249
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:54,086
枪
Gun.

250
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:58,081
我听不懂
I don't think I understand.

251
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,050
他说什么?
What is it?

252
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,084
他知道我们在做什么了
He knows what we're doing.

253
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:20,004
他知道这是一个陷阱
He knows it's a trap.

254
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:33,046
他说他懂得的英语比我想象的要多
He says he understands english etter than I think he does.

255
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:42,021
他知道我背叛了他
He knows I betrayed him.

256
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,094
枪
Gun.

257
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:48,066
你会用吗?
Can you handle one of these?

258
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,022
这是自动...
It's an automatic--

259
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:11,025
我想你在船上更安全
I think you'll be safer on the boat.

260
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:17,059
Sun...
Sun...

261
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,044
如果一旦他们突破了我们 船里还有把枪
If by chance they get past us, there's another gun.

262
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:24,045
在橱柜下方的蓝油布下
It's inside the blue tarp beneath the galley counter.

263
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:31,002
如果他们突破了你们 就意味着我丈夫已经死了...
If they get past you, that means my husband is dead...

264
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:34,067
我就什么都不在乎了
and I won't care anymore.

265
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:39,085
听我说  枪就在油布下面
As I said, lhe gun is inside the tarp.

266
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:10,052
退后
Back off!

267
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:13,003
James
James.

268
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:16,024
把枪放下...
Put the gun down...

269
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:18,087
就现在
right now.

270
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:24,059
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

271
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,071
等等

272
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:41,024
你知道我是谁吗?

273
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:44,037
你知道我为什么来吗?

274
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,072
我很抱歉

275
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:48,045
现在你知道...

276
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:51,016
我要干什么了吧

277
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:54,063
我很抱歉

278
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:57,095
抱歉

279
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:05,031
滚出国去

280
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,059
听懂了吗?

281
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:09,009
你滚出去...

282
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,018
不要再回来

283
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:12,052
开始新生活

284
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:14,095
一旦我知道你回来了...

285
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:18,020
或和国内有什么联系的话...

286
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,079
你就完了

287
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,013
懂了吗?

288
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:25,092
这里没有你这号人了

289
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:34,083
我想他们不会来了
I don't think they're coming.

290
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:11,002
我要你放我下船
I want you to let me off this boat.

291
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:14,016
我办不到
I can't do that.

292
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,005
为什么?
Why not?

293
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:18,068
我没这个权利
That's not my decision to make.

294
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:24,066
- 你应该知道我们有五个人... - 小声点
-You realize there are five of my friends up there-- -Lower your voice.

295
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:27,005
好吧

296
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:30,027
站住

297
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:34,042
不  你不会的  Sun
No, you won't, Sun.

298
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:37,026
我知道你  Sun-Hwa Kwon
I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon.

299
00:30:37,026 --> 00:30:41,008
你不会杀人的
And I know you're not a killer.

300
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:45,084
不管你们怎么想  我们都不是敌人
Despite what you may think,I am not the enemy.

301
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:48,090
我们都不是敌人
We are not the enemy.

302
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,018
但如果你开枪了...
But if you shoot me...

303
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,021
那我们就注定是敌人了
that's exactly what we'll become.

304
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,012
站住

305
00:30:57,012 --> 00:31:00,036
我会开枪的
I will. I'll shoot you.

306
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:23,041
Sun
Sun!

307
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:44,002
不

308
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:02,002
不

309
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:16,038
你不应该来的

310
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:18,061
爸爸

311
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:22,058
你来干什么?

312
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:27,032
我和这个年轻人的父亲有生意往来

313
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,067
我说过他是从阳台上跳下来的

314
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:38,084
他一定是不齿自己的作为了

315
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:40,086
现在...

316
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:44,041
回到你丈夫那去

317
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:50,009
爸爸

318
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:57,000
你会告诉Jin吗?

319
00:33:57,042 --> 00:34:00,077
要告诉也不应该由我来说

320
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:27,084
我不知道失去你我会怎样

321
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:32,021
失去你们

322
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:39,054
我很抱歉我把你们扯进来
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

323
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:46,076
请对你的丈夫说 下一次  我会听他的
And please communicate to your husband, the next time, I will listen to him.

324
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:48,047
我们得走了
We should go.

325
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:52,011
还要走很多的路
We have a long walk ahead of us.

326
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:26,096
你没事吧?
You okay?

327
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:29,038
好得不能再好了
Never better.

328
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:34,063
你到底在想什么?
What the hell were you thinking?

329
00:35:34,063 --> 00:35:37,070
我情不自禁
I couldn't help myself.

330
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:42,084
你挥动镐的动作太美了
You just looked so damn cute swinging that pickax.

331
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:44,093
你很适合做苦工啊  小妞
Chain gang looks good on you, freckles.

332
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:47,025
Sawyer
Sawyer.

333
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:58,068
他们中有两个打架很厉害
Two of those guards got some real fight in 'em.

334
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:01,072
其他人就不怎么担心了
Rest of 'em, I ain't that much worried about.

335
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:06,031
被那个魁梧的家伙打一拳还真够你受的
That heavyset guy packs a hell of a punch.

336
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:11,028
头发很乱的小子受过军事训练 但是不得以的情况下我还是能撂倒他的
Shaggy-Haired kid's got some sort of martial arts 
training, but I think I could take him if I had to.

337
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:16,078
还有...那些电击的东西上有保险装置
Oh, and F.Y.I., those zapper things got a safety on 'em.

338
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:22,003
当你拿着来福枪的时侯   看到他们的表情了吗?
Did you see the look on their faces when you got a hold of that rifle?

339
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:31,040
我猜他们很多人从没见过枪战
I'm guessin' most of these boys never seen any real action.

340
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,021
但是那个拿枪指着你的金发女人...
But that blonde who had a gun to your head...

341
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:39,068
她会开枪的  毫无疑问
she woulda shot you, no problem.

342
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:43,044
她为什么叫你James?
Why'd she call you James?

343
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:49,097
因为那是我的名字
'Cause that's my name.

344
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,087
我还注意到了
I noticed somethin' else, too.

345
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:59,025
你的味道就像草莓
You taste like strawberries.

346
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,031
你的味道就像鱼形饼干
You taste like fish biscuits.

347
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:14,024
那我们该怎么办?
So what do we do now?

348
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:17,005
那么...
Well, shortcake...

349
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:21,074
我们只有等这些混蛋自己犯错了
now we wait for these bastards to make a mistake.

350
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:24,079
迟早  他们会放松警惕
Sooner or later, they're gonna let their guard down.

351
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:31,059
一旦他们这么做了 我们就让他们该呆在哪里就呆在哪里
And when they do, we're gonna be thereto put 'em in their place.

352
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:45,040
你好  Jack
Hello, Jack.

353
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:02,096
你知道么  Jack?
You know what's crazy Jack?

354
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:07,018
一周前  你和我的情况正好相反
A week ago, you and I were in exactly the opposite situation.

355
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:12,021
我是那个被锁起来的人 而你是那个走进来的人
I was the one locked up, and you were the one coming in for visits.

356
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:23,043
并且我知道你很生气 因为我骗了你关于我是谁的事
And I know that you were angry, that I lied to you about who I was

357
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:27,058
但是...你怪我吗?
but...Hell ! Do you blame me?

358
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:28,054
我是说  我们面对事实吧
I mean, let's face it.

359
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:36,002
如果我跟你说我就是你和你朋友 指的"其他人"中的一员
If I'd have told you I was one of those people, that you and your
 friends have been calling "others" all this time,

360
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:42,098
那就会招来Sayid和他的拳头
it would've been right back to Sayid and his...fists.

361
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:45,026
不是吗?
Wouldn't it?

362
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:49,005
你想要什么?
What do you want from me?

363
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:53,069
我想改变你的...
I want for you to change your...

364
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,063
想法
perspective.

365
00:38:56,063 --> 00:39:05,022
那么第一步就是诚恳地向你介绍我是谁
And the first step in doing that would be
 for me to...be decent enough to introduce myself honestly, so...

366
00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:13,089
你好
Hi.

367
00:39:15,038 --> 00:39:22,085
我叫Benjamin Linus  我一生都生活在这个岛上
My name is Benjamin Linus, and I've lived on this island all my life.

368
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:34,070
你不和我握手吗?
You're not gonna shake?

369
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:47,060
带进来
Bring it in, please.

370
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,068
Kate和Sawyer在哪?
Where are Kate and Sawyer?

371
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:53,068
他们很好  就在附近
They're fine, and they're close.

372
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:55,073
现在我只能告诉你这些
That's all I'm able to tell you right now.

373
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:57,073
你可以告诉我任何你想说的
You can tell me anything you want.

374
00:39:57,073 --> 00:40:00,046
很好
Fair enough.

375
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,099
我就是想告诉你这些
It's all I want to tell you.

376
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:08,087
我会说的很简单的  Jack
I'm gonna make this really simple, Jack.

377
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:14,023
如果你合作的话  我们就送你回家
If you cooperate, we send you home.

378
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,019
合作什么?
Cooperate with what?

379
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:18,029
- 到时候会告诉你的... - 现在就告诉我
- When the time is right, I'll tell you. - You tell me now.

380
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:21,008
耐心点  Jack
Patience, Jack.

381
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,081
- 耐心点 - 家
- Patience. - Home.

382
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:27,020
就是你送Walt和Micheal去的地方吗?
Is that where you sent Walt and Michael?

383
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,072
是的
Yes.

384
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,043
如果你可以离开这个岛  你怎么还会在这?
If you could leave this island, why would you still be here?

385
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:38,007
是的  Jack
Yes, Jack.

386
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:41,017
我们为什么要在这?
Why would we be here?

387
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,091
你在说谎
You're lying.

388
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:45,038
你和我们一样也被困在这里了
You're stuck here just like we are.

389
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:49,070
- 你不知... - 你们的飞机在2004年9月22日坠毁
-You dont have any... -Your flight crashed on september 22, 2004.

390
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,092
今天是11月29号
Today is november 29th.

391
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:53,073
就是说你们在岛上已经69天了
That means you've been on our island for 69 days.

392
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:56,071
是的  我们和外界有联系  Jack
And, yes, we do have contact with the outside world, Jack.

393
00:40:56,071 --> 00:41:02,046
所以我们知道在这69天里 George W. Bush连任了总统
That's how we know that during those 69 days,
 your fellow americans reelected George W. Bush,

394
00:41:02,046 --> 00:41:10,006
Christopher Reeve死了 并且波士顿红袜队拿了联赛冠军
Christopher Reeve has passed away, Boston Red Sox won the world series.

395
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:15,007
什么?
What?

396
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:21,023
你想让我相信的话就不应该说是红袜队夺冠
If you wanted me to believe this,you probably 
should've picked somebody else besides the Red Sox.

397
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:24,087
不  他们在决赛中连下3场赢了美国人队
No, they were down three games to none 
against the Yankees in the league championship,

398
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:26,049
这已经是他们的8连胜了
and then they won eight straight.

399
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:27,096
是啊是啊
Sure, sure.

400
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:30,065
当然是这样了
Of course they did.

401
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:44,053
红袜队的球迷渴望了很久了
Red Sox fans have longed to hear it.

402
00:41:44,053 --> 00:41:49,083
波士顿红袜队是世界冠军

403
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:53,095
在完成对对手的横扫之后

404
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:59,087
红袜队在Busch体育场中央庆祝
and the Red Sox celebrate in the middle of the diamond here at Busch stadium.

405
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:10,059
那就是家  Jack  就在玻璃的那边
That's home, Jack, right there on the other side of that glass.

406
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:13,070
如果你听我的  如果你相信我
And if you listen to me, if you trust me,

407
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:19,010
如果到时你按我说的做 我就带你去那里
