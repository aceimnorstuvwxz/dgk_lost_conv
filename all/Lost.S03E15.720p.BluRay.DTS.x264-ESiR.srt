剧情回顾...
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,059
门前有辆租来的车  你开车去Sioux城
There's a rental car parked out front. Got to Sue city.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,029
然后去Sage Flower汽车旅馆

我不管Jack都说了什么

我们要把他救回来  这是我欠他的
They've got him, and we have to get him back. I owe him that.

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,029
很显然  现在情况有所变化
Obviously, the circumstances have changed.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,099
他也许不希望我们来救他
He may not want to be rescued.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
他在跟"the others"握手
If he's shaking hands with the others,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,049
我相信他有自己的理由
I'm sure he has a good reason.

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,099
我们是来救Jack的  现在可以行动了
We came here to rescue Jack, and that's what we're gonna do.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,099
你来这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
- 我是来救你的  - 快离开这儿
-I came to get you.  -Get outta here.

16

别伤害她
Don't hurt her!

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,049
我和他们做了笔交易  他们答应放我走
I made a deal with them.They're gonna let me go.

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,079
去哪里?

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,090
回家

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,009
Jack  我们该走了
Jack, we need to go.

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,059
呆在那儿别动
Hey, hold it right there!

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,089
把手举起来  跪下  我叫你跪下
Get your hands up! Get down! I said get down!

23
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,039
- 你在这儿做什么  John?  - 我很抱歉  Jack
-What are you doing here, John?  -I'm sorry, Jack.

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,030
为什么?

我只是来给你送点吃的

好好享受你的三明治吧

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,049
I go out walkin' after midnight...

38
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,009
等很久了吧?
Been on the road a while, huh?

39
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,009
还要多久?
How long is it gonna take?

40
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,059
你的挡风玻璃被射穿了  估计要两天
Well, your fan belt's shot. I'll take two days,

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,050
也许要三天

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,060
换这个要用三天?
Three days for a fan belt?

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,019
欢迎来到Iowa城

45

我叫Lucy
I'm Lucy.

47
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,090
along the highway

48
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,070
well, that's just my way

49
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,030
of sayin' I love you

50
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,029

全都是18K的

最便宜也要500块
Cheapest one in retail for 500 bucks.

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,029
拜托  一看就知道是假的  我才不买呢
Come on. Those don't look real. I'm not buying.

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,089
你什么意思  看起来像假的?
What do you mean, they don't look real?

55
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,029
听着  如果不是我伯父破产了  你绝对买不到...
My uncle's going out of business.

56
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,049
如果你要进城的话  我马上就来
If you need a lift into town, I'm finished up here in an hour.

57
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,099
- 快报警  - 好吧  随便你  这是你自己的损失
-I call the cops.  -Fine. Whatever. Your loss.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,099
- 有什么问题吗  伙计?  - 是啊  她想骗我的钱
-Is there a problem, buddy?  -Yeah, there's a problem.I'm getting scammed here,

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,059
- 就这么回事  - 听着  我很抱歉
-that's the problem.  -Look, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,009
你当我是白痴吗 
What do you think, I'm an idiot?

61
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,080
伙计  如果你不想买就算了
If you don't want to buy them, don't buy them.

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,009
这些项链是假的  你是个骗子
Those are fake necklaces, and you're a rip-off artist.

63
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,069
- 这些都是真的  - 快报警吧!
-They're real.  -Call the cops.

64
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,029
如果你不买有人会来买的
You don't want them, I'll find somebody else.

65
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,030
拿来让我看看
Hey, let me see those.

66
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,049
我父亲是开珠宝店的
My father owns a jewelry store.

67
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,010
我能辨别真伪  多少钱?
I think I can spot a fake.How much?

68
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,039
60块
60 bucks.

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,050
我买一条
I'll take the one on the end.

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,050
随便你吧!
Whatever.

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,070
没什么
Yeah.

72
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,020
能把钱还我了吗?
Can I get my money back?

73
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
你为什么要帮我?
Why'd you help me?

74
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,010
没什么  只是一个女孩帮助另一个女孩
Just one girl watching another girl's back, I guess.

75
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,059
我猜出于什么原因
Or you're stranded here,

76
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,059
你也被困在这儿了
and for some reason,

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,040
你不希望那人去报警
you didn't want that guy calling the cops.

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,010
我载你进城吧  但你要请我喝酒
I'll give you a ride into town. You buy me a drink.

79
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,070
什么事?
What?

80
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,010
Kate
Kate

81
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,079
John?
John?

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,070
你在这儿做什么?
What are you doing?

83
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,059
你被他们抓了吗?
Did they capture you?

84
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,099
是的  不过...
Yes, but...

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,050
那只是暂时的
Only temporarily.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,020
我是来和你告别的
I came to say good-bye.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,089
告别?
Good-bye?

88
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,019
- 我要跟他们走了  - 究竟发生了什么事?
-I'm leaving with them.  -What the hell is going on?

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,059
他们把你怎么了  你被洗脑了吗?
I mean, what are they doing to you? Are you brainwashed?

90
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,089
- Jack去哪了?  - Jack哪也没去  Kate
-Where did Jack go?  -Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate.

91
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,070
和你一样  他也会被留在这里
He's gonna have to stay behind, like you.

92
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,099
你不能相信他们
You can't trust them.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,009
如果他们答应你带你回家
If they told you that they're gonna take you home,

94
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,080
- 他们是在撒谎...  - 我不想回家
-they're lying...  -I don't want to go home.

95
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,019
希望你明白  我一直对你很放心
I want you to know, I made a strong case for you.

96
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,029
我告诉他们你是个好人
I told them that you were a good person.

97
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,029
可靠  聪明  诚实
reliable, smart, honest.

98
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,030
然而他们告诉我你是谁  还有你的所作所为
And then they told me who you were and what you had done.

99
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,050
看来我并不擅长于宽恕
Let's just say, forgiveness isn't one of their strong suits.

100
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,060
祝你好运
Good luck.

101
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,050
John  你要去哪?
John, where are you going?

102
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,029
我出来了
Coming out!

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,029
Jack在哪  还有Sayid
Where is Jack and where is Sayid?

104
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,090
你有没有看见Rousseau
Have you seen Rousseau?

105
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,029
Jonh  你到底怎么了?
John, please. What's happened to you?

106
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,020
我很抱歉  Kate
I'm sorry, Kate.

107
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,039
你有病啊?
What the hell's wrong with you?

108
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,020
不要看着我  就假装我们没在说话
Don't look at me, and pretend we're not talking.

109
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,019
- 我本不该来找你的  - 很好  那就快滚开
-I'm not supposed to be here.  -Good. Then scram.

110
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,069
伙计  大家最近都在议论你
Dude, you need to know that there's been some chatter.

111
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,009
关于Paulo和Nikki的死  还有近来发生的一切
After Paulo and Nikki and everything,

112
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,039
是这样的  明天大家会进行投票
Well, tomorrow there's gonna be a vote.

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,010
- 投什么票  - 投票是否该赶走你
-A vote for what?  -To decide whether or not to banish you.

114
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,059
赶我走?
Banish me?

115
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,059
到哪里去?
Where?

116
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,099
大家还在商量
Well, there was debate about that,

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
- 但大多数人认为应该让你去半里外的那个海滩  - 大多数人
-but the consensus was half a mile down the beach.  -Consensus?

118
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,039
我来是想告诉你  你还是有机会留下的
I'm only saying this because there may be a way to fix it

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,050
比如说婉转的道歉
to, like, make amends.

120
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,069
我才不道歉呢
I don't do amends.

121
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,029
你自己想想
You might want to ask yourself

122
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,029
我们这个群体
about all the good stuff that comes from being

123
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,090
为你提供了很多好处
part of this... society.

124
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,049
你自己根本无法独立生存
I mean, you can't even feed yourself.

125
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,049
你用我们建的厕所
You use our latrine,

126
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,059
喝的是Steve每天早上运来的水...
drink the water that Steve brings every morning to the trough...

127
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,069
怎么了?
What?

128
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,040
我已经3天10小时15分钟
You know how for 3 days, 10 h and 15 min

129
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,090
没有叫你们绰号了
I ain't allowed to use nicknames?

130
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,049
是啊
Yeah.

131
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,080
那么  你  Hugo先生
Well, you, sir... Hugo,

132
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,079
是一个"小胖"
are rotund,

133
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,019
讨厌的家伙
annoying,

134
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,029
你还破坏了我的景致
and you're ruining my damn view.

135
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,050
这样道歉怎么样?
How's that for amends?

136
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,010
你犯了个大的错误  兄弟
You're making a big mistake, dude.

137
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,040
赶我走...
Banish me...

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,010
告诉我你的名字吧
How about you tell me your name?

139
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,069
我叫Lucy
It's Lucy.

140
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,090
那你的真名是什么?
And what's your real name?

141
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,079
- 下次有人问的时候  你不必去想  - 我没有去想
-Next time somebody asks, you don't think about it.  -I didn't think

142
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
别骗我了
Not even for a second.

143
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,080
为什么叫Lucy
So why Lucy?

144
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,059
她是个圣女
She's a saint.

145
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,019
我上主日学校的时候  都要背诵那些名字
I had to memorize them all in Sunday's school,

146
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,050
我发现直到现在 
so I figure they're probably still

147
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,069
我还一直没有忘记它们
rattling around my brain.

148
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,060
那是什么让一个上主日学的女孩
What makes a girl who went

149
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,070
害怕起警察来的?
to Sunday school scared of cops?

150
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,099
几个月前我杀了我的继父
A few months ago, I killed my stepfather.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,030
还从警官手里逃走了
I escaped from the marshal who arrested me for it.

152
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,070
为什么?
Why?

153
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,010
因为他是个坏人
'cause he was a bad guy.

154
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,060
那么你在Iowa做什么?
So...what the hell are you doing in Iowa?

155
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,070
我想和我母亲谈谈
I want to talk to my mother.

156
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,049
那你在这里可得小心了
You're gonna have a really hard time doing that,

157
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,099
因为如果你真的要这样做的话
because if you did what you just said you did,

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,099
联邦探员们会一直监视她的
the feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,079
- 我会想出办法的  - 是吗?
-I'll figure something out.  -Oh, you will, huh?

160
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,090
你打算帮我吗?
What, you want to help me?

161
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,070
当然
Absolutely.

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,090
为什么?
Why?

163
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,090
我爱上了一个不该爱的人
I fell in love with the wrong guy,

164
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,020
然后我把我这辈子的积蓄都给了他
and then I gave him my life savings.

165
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,079
他却骗我  这让我难堪
He conned me and embarrassed me.

166
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,020
他也是个坏人
He was a bad guy.

167
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,079
所以...
So...

168
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,089
我会帮你见到你母亲的  Lucy
I'll help you get the meeting with your mom... Lucy,

169
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,020
总有一个人要交好运的
because one of us deserves something good.

170
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,010
看来我得不到韩国人的票了
I ain't gonna get the Korean vote.

171
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,019
我们开始吧!
All right, let's do it!

172
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,060
什么?
Do what?

173
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,039
我准备好向大家道歉了
I'm ready to do it: make amends,

174
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,060
努力改变现状
change the vote.

175
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,059
我可不想被赶跑
I don't wanna be banished, okay?

176
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,049
你高兴了吧
You happy?

177
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,060
伙计  你真臭
Dude, you stink.

178
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,000
什么来的  鱼吗?
What is that, fish?

179
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,029
才不是
No.

180
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,090
你刚自己杀鱼?
Did you try to gut one yourself?

181
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,059
你怎么到现在都还没有学会啊?
How have you not learned that by now?

182
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,099
我们到这里都三个月了
I mean, we've been here, like, three months.

183
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,049
别废话了  我们开始吧
Could we just do this?

184
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,050
做什么?
Do what?

185
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,030
与人为善
Make nice?

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,090
先为刚才你叫我绰号道歉
Apologize for calling me all those names.

187
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,050
我很抱歉叫你"小胖"
I'm really sorry I called you "rotund."

188
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,079
真的?
Really?

189
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,019
天啊  你比女孩还坏
You're worse than a girl.

190
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,009
拜托
Come on.

191
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,000
我们去传达关爱吧
Let's spread the love.

192
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,029
我怎么会在这儿?
What the hell am I doing here?

193
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,039
- 你来告诉我  - 我不知道
-Why don't you tell me?  -I don't know.

194
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,030
我也不知道
I don't know either!

195
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,070
所以你不如先放开我的手
So, why don't you let go of my wrist?

196
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,060
到底发生了什么事?
So what the hell happened?

197
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,009
我正在泡茶
I was making a cup of tea.

198
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,080
一个瓦斯罐扔了进来
Canister came in through the window.

199
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,010
你做了什么让他们这么生气?
So what'd you do to piss them off?

200
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,039
你这是在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

201
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,009
刀口太大了
The knife is too big.

202
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,069
我们需要小点的东西 比如别针什么的...
We need something smaller. A safety pin...

203
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,000
- 我们要回去  - 什么?
-We're going back.  -What?

204
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,039
他们这样对待我们  你还想回去?
They did this to us. Why would we go back?

205
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,069
你说"他们"  好像当初是你把我关进笼子的
You say "they" like you didn't lock me in a cage

206
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,040
还整天看着我碾碎石头
and watch me break rocks all day.

207
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,019
我们要回你的村子是因为
We're going back to your village because

208
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,089
我的朋友也可能中了瓦斯弹  就像我们一样
my friends were probably gassed, just like us.

209
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,049
反正你的人都已经走了
Your people are gone anyway.

210
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,029
- 我看到他们打包走了  - 什么?
-I saw them all pack up and leave.  -What?

211
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,080
Locke来向我告别
Locke came to me to say good-bye.

212
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,019
他们去别的地方了
They were taking off, going somewhere else.

213
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,049
走了?  去哪儿?
Going? Going where?

214
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,030
他没说
He didn't exactly tell me.

215
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,050
欢迎你来到茫然的世界
Welcome to the wonderful world of not knowing what the hell's going on.

216
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,079
快!
Go,go,go!

217
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,079
趴下!
On the ground!

218
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,099
趴下  趴在地上
Get down! On the ground!

219
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,080
把手举起来
Let me see those hands!

220
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,090
把手举起来
Let me see those hands!

221
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,060
好久不见了  Austen
Long time no see, Austen.

222
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,099
你是谁?
Who the hell are you?

223
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,030
我只是来卖圣经的
I'm just selling bibles!

224
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,070
他们盘问了我半个小时
They questioned me for half an hour.

225
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,049
还拿走了我的手提包
He confiscated my case.

226
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,079
问我卖圣经的事还有...
He was asking me about selling bibles and...

227
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,089
还好我知道该怎么撒谎
It's a good thing I know how to lie.

228
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,079
现在我们知道面对的是什么人了
Yeah, now we know what we're up against, right?

229
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,039
现在我们知道有六个人在等着抓你  Lucy
Yeah, now we know that there were six guys waiting to take you down, Lucy

230
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,019
没关系  我会想办法的
Yeah, it's okay. I'll figure it out.

231
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,059
想办法?  那个警官
Figure it out? That marshal

232
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,019
我不知道你对他干了什么
I don't know what you did to him,

233
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,079
但如果他再抓到你的话
but if he ever gets his hands on you,

234
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,059
到时不是你死就是他亡
it is gonna be you or him.

235
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,049
如果你改变了主意
Look, if you've changed your mind,

236
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,059
如果你不想帮我了 我能理解
if you don't wanna help me, I get it.

237
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,059
不  我想帮你
No, I do wanna help you,

238
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,049
如果要我对联邦探员撒谎  Lucy
but if I'm lying to federal agents, Lucy,

239
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:02,000
让你能和你母亲见面的话...
so that you can have a chat with your mom...

240
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,059
那至少给我一个
then I at least need to know

241
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,040
好的理由
that there's a pretty good reason.

242
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,049
他过去经常酗酒还殴打我妈妈
He... used to get drunk and beat up my mom,

243
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,009
所以我炸了他的房子
so I blew up his house.

244
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,000
我...
I...

245
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,080
把那次爆炸做的像场意外
Made it look like an accident.

246
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
一次煤气泄漏
a gas leak.

247
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,099
我领取了房子的保险金...
Took out an insurance policy on the house...

248
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,010
为了她
for her.

249
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,050
让她能过上好日子
Set her up for life.

250
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,010
但是她却举报了我
And then she gave me up.

251
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,020
反而选择了他
Chose him over me.

252
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,039
我要和她谈谈的原因是...
So the reason I need to talk to her is...

253
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,049
某个我爱的人...
someone I love...

254
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,049
某个应该关心我的人
Someone who's supposed to care about me

255
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,049
却背叛了我
betrayed me,

256
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,090
我要知道为什么
and I wanna know why.

257
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
好吧
Well

258
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,080
我们一起去找出答案吧
then let's go find out.

259
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,049
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

260
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,049
他们应该会留下些踪迹
Whoever dragged us out here left a trail.

261
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,090
那可以帮我们找到回去的路
It'll lead us back to where we came from.

262
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,009
马上要下雨了
Let's go.It's gonna rain.

263
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,050
你不认为我们应该等到明天再走吗?
Don't you think we should wait till morning?

264
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,050
不
No.

265
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,019
为什么?
Why?

266
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,049
什么为什么?
Why what?

267
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,019
为什么他们把我们铐在一起
Why would they handcuff you to me

268
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,059
然后还把我们拖进丛林?
and then drag us all the way out into the jungle?

269
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,030
Ben很擅长玩心理游戏
Ben has a thing for mind games.

270
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,099
这就是他把你丢下的原因?
Is that why he left you behind?

271
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,030
我们一定要讨论这个吗?
Do we really have to talk?

272
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,060
不
Nope.

273
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,099
快点  如果地上都湿了我就找不到踪迹了
Come on. If the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.

274
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,010
我希望你不是为了他 
I hope you're not dragging me

275
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,000
才把我一路拽回去
all the way back there with you for him.

276
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,089
你说什么?
Excuse me?

277
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,019
我希望你不是为了Jack而回去
I hope you're not going back for Jack,

278
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,079
当他对你说不要回去找他的时候
because I was standing right there

279
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,059
我当时在场
when he told you not to come back,

280
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,020
现在你又毁了他离开这里的机会
and now that you've ruined his chance to get off the island...

281
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
你讲完了没有?
You done?

282
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,080
我问你讲完了没有?
I said, are you done?

283
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,010
我...很抱歉 我不是故意...
I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

284
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,080
那是什么东西?
What the hell was that?

285
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,019
快起来
Get up!

286
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,080
我的肩膀脱臼了  起来
You dislocated my shoulder!

287
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,090
快点
Come on!

288
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,030
等等  来这边
Wait! Come here.

289
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,009
好了  快蹲下
Okay. Get down.

290
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,090
那到底是...
What the hell...

291
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,070
我们安全了吗?
Are we safe?

292
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,090
我不知道
You tell me.

293
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,049
我才不会亲什么小孩的
I ain't kissing no damn baby.

294
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,029
Claire在这里挺有人缘的
Claire's, like, really influential.

295
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,039
如果她选你留下  你就不用担心了
If she votes for you to stay, you're home free, dude.

296
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,019
她为什么会不同意
Why wouldn't she vote for me?

297
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:38,010
- 我又没有对她做过什么坏事  - 也没做过什么好事
-It's not like I ever done anything bad to her.  -but you never did anything good for her either.

298
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,019
你有关心过Aaron吗?
And have you ever even asked how Aaron is?

299
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,019
我知道他
I know how he is.

300
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,049
哭声又大  身上也难闻
He cries loud, and he smells.

301
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,009
这就是你的问题
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

302
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,079
你很会讽刺人  大家都不喜欢这点
You're sarcastic. People don't like that.

303
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,090
好吧  那我过去...
All right.So I go over...

304
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,089
然后怎么做?
And do what?

305
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,010
母亲都希望大家注意自己的宝宝
Moms love it when you show an interest in their babies.

306
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,009
你走过去说些好听的话
So go over there, say something nice,

307
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,089
叫她Claire
call her "Claire".

308
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,080
然后把这个给她
And give her this.

309
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,040
我知道你能做到的  伙计
I know you can do it, dude.

310
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Claire
Hey, Claire

311
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,090
你好...小宝宝
Hey there... little baby...

312
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,010
Aaron
Aaron

313
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,029
我能为你做什么吗?
Is there anything I can do for you?

314
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,070
不  我只是过来看看你的宝宝
No. I just came by...to see your baby.

315
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,080
他不像几周前皮肤还皱巴巴的拉
He's not as wrinkly as he was a couple weeks ago.

316
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,050
是啊  我也这么觉得  谢谢
Yeah, I... guess he's not. Thanks.

317
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,030
这个给你
Oh, and... this is for you.

318
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,000
谢谢
Thank you.

319
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,040
我不太喜欢...
I don't like...

320
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,060
毯子
blankets.

321
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,049
好吧  晚安
Well, good night.

322
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,040
晚安
Good night.

323
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,039
你认为它走了吗?
Do you think it's gone?

324
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,049
- 我们安全了吗?  - 你不是认真的吧
-Are we safe?  -Are you serious?

325
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,009
- 什么?  - 你从没见过那东西?
-What?  -You've never seen that?

326
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,019
如果你不相信我  你可以
If you don't believe me,you can always

327
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,010
把我另一只手也拽脱臼
pull my other shoulder out of its socket.

328
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,069
我不是...我不是故意...
I was... I wasn't trying to...

329
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,079
不要找借口了
Don't flatter yourself.

330
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,000
这是我第四次脱臼了
This is the fourth time it's been dislocated.

331
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,010
把手给我
Give me your hand.

332
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,029
为什么?
Why?

333
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,019
- 你要把我的肩膀复位  - 不  我不会...
-'cause I want you to pop it back in.  -No, I'm not gonna...

334
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,049
你必须这么做  我现在就感觉
You're gonna.Right, now it feels

335
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,009
像有碎玻璃扎在里面似的
like there's broken glass under my skin,

336
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,069
如果不是因为你们
and if it weren't for you,

337
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,089
我早就在回家的路上了
I would be on my way home right now.

338
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,039
Jack让我不回去找他  是为了保护我
Jack told me not to come back to protect me,

339
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,020
他不想让我受到伤害
because he didn't want me to get hurt.

340
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,079
你这么想吗?
Is that what you think?

341
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,000
是的  我就这么想
Yeah, that's what I think.

342
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:16,020
我们在所有的笼子外都装有摄像机  Kate
We have cameras on the cages, Kate...all of them.

343
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,099
他看见你
He saw you.

344
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,030
你和Sawyer
you and Sawyer.

345
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,069
Jack让你不要回来的原因
The reason Jack told you not to come back

346
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,000
不是因为他怕你受到伤害
wasn't because he didn't want you to get hurt.

347
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,030
而是因为你伤了他的心
It was because you broke his heart.

348
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,049
所以...
So...

349
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:43,020
按住我的肩关节  然后把它扳回去
grab my wrist,push up and twist.

350
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,009
为什么要这么早来这里
Why do we gotta be out here so damn early?

351
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,000
因为你要我帮你抓只野猪
You asked me to help you catch a boar.

352
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,010
而现在正是它们出来觅食的时候
Well, this is when they break cover to eat.

353
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,079
好像它们都白天睡觉似的
Looks like they picked a day to sleep in.

354
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,000
你鱼钓得怎么样了  伙计
So what's your angle, brother?

355
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,059
钓鱼?
My angle?

356
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,029
你从来不怎么和我说话
Well, you...Haven't spoken three words to me,and then

357
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,070
怎么突然想做我的打猎伙伴?
suddenly you want to be my hunting partner.

358
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,019
钓鱼
My angle

359
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,099
正是我改变态度的原因
is I got hearts and minds to change,

360
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,050
这里行得通的就是贿赂
and politics is all about bribes.

361
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:40,010
既然钱在这里也没什么价值
Since money don't mean squat on this island,

362
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,010
我就得给人们一些他们想要的
I gotta give the people something they like.

363
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,080
大家都喜欢吃肉 
And people like meat.

364
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,060
你肩膀怎么样了?
How's your shoulder?

365
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,049
非常好
Awesome.

366
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,050
那我们走吧
Then let's get going.

367
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,030
谢谢
Thank you.

368
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,070
不用谢  甜心
You're welcome, sweetheart.

369
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,019
天啊  对不起  真对不起
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

370
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,019
- 没关系的  - 我真蠢
-No worries.  -I'm such an idiot.

371
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,010
这种事经常发生 
It happens all the time, sweetheart.

372
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,050
谢谢你
Thank you.

373
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,080
你好  妈妈
Hi, mom.

374
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,090
你在这里干嘛  Katherine?
What are you doing here, Katherine?

375
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,090
你看起来不错
You look good.

376
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,030
我问你你来这里干什么
I asked you what you were doing here.

377
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,099
我想知道为什么你要告诉他们我对Wayne所做的事
I want to know why you told them what I did to Wayne.

378
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,099
我以为你来这里
I thought maybe you came because

379
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,060
是因为你想向我道歉
you wanted to say you were sorry.

380
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,070
我不感到抱歉
I'm not sorry.

381
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,069
他打你  把你当作狗来对待
He hit you. He treated you like a dog

382
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,029
而你...
and you...

383
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,010
你帮不了我的  Katherine
You can't help who you love, Katherine.

384
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,010
不管他是好是坏  我爱他
And for good or bad, I loved him.

385
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,019
而你却活活烧死了他
And you burnt him alive.

386
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,009
你打开了煤气  点了一把火
You turned on the gas, and you lit a match.

387
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,060
你无情地杀了他
You murdered him in cold blood.

388
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,059
我那么做都是为了你
I did it for you.

389
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,060
不
No.

390
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,000
你这么做是为了你自己
What you did, you did for yourself.

391
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,070
我要回去工作了
I have to go back to work.

392
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,039
因为你是我的女儿
Because you are my daughter,

393
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,080
我不会告诉坐在桌旁的
I'm not gonna tell the two men sitting at the table

394
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,039
那两个已经跟了我一个月的人
who've been following me for the last month

395
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,029
说你在这里
that you are here,

396
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,070
但我发誓  Katie
but I swear to god, Katie...

397
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,050
如果我再见到你
if I ever see you again,

398
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,070
我都会毫不犹豫地大声呼救
the first thing I will do is yell for help.

399
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,040
再见
Good-bye.

400
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,062
他跟你说了吗?
Did he say that to you?

401
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:10,017
说什么?
Sorry?

402
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,026
我伤了他的心
That I broke his heart.

403
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:16,006
他不说我也知道
He didn't have to.

404
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:20,045
你根本不了解他
You don't know anything about him.

405
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:21,091
我知道他在哪里出生
I know where he was born.

406
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:23,064
我知道他父母是做什么的
I know what his parents did for a living.

407
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:25,093
我知道他结婚了
I know that he was married

408
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:27,095
还知道他娶的是谁
and who he was married to.

409
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:32,014
我还知道他为什么离婚  他父亲是怎么死的
I know why he got a divorce. I know how his father died.

410
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,099
体重  生日  血型
his weight, his birthday and his blood type.

411
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:42,003
你对他又了解多少  Kate?
What do you know about him, Kate?

412
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:49,063
我们走吧
Let's go.

413
00:30:55,073 --> 00:30:56,097
快跑
Run.

414
00:30:56,098 --> 00:31:00,093
快跑!
Run!

415
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,049
快起来  起来!
Get up! Get up!

416
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,020
快跑  快点
Run! Run! Come on!

417
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,039
- 你在干什么?  - 我知道这个陷阱有多可怕
-What are you doing?  -I know what happens when you set those things off!

418
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,059
我们绕着走过去
We will go alongside them.

419
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,059
我们不需要  我们可以躲在另一边
We don't need to! We can go around there...off!

420
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,080
该死!
Damn it!

421
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,059
你还是过来这边比较好!
You're gonna want to be over here.

422
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:48,060
Kate  快过来
Kate, come on!

423
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:30,064
我们不知道那是什么
We don't know what it is,

424
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:32,014
但看起来它不怎么喜欢我们这个屏障
but we know that it doesn't like our fences.

425
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:34,071
你有钥匙
You had a key!

426
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,034
他们也把我丢下了  我也被毒气放倒了
They left me behind, too. They gassed me.

427
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:39,048
我知道你不怎么关心
I know that you don't care,

428
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:42,065
但那些过去三年来和我一起生活的人
but the people I spent the last three years of my life with

429
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:45,023
就这么把我扔下了
they just left me!

430
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:50,082
我想也许...
I thought that maybe...

431
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:55,079
也许我能让你觉得我们是一起的
Maybe if I could make you think that we were in it together.

432
00:32:57,074 --> 00:33:01,060
也许我不会再一次被抛弃
Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.

433
00:33:38,054 --> 00:33:40,043
太美味了
It's delicious!

434
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:43,063
再来一点达摩A1  还有辣椒粉
Just a little Dharma A1 and paprika.

435
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:48,023
我希望你能在会议中记得提起这次烧烤
I hope you'll remember this little barbecue at your meeting later.

436
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,084
要开会吗?
Oh, what meeting?

437
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:53,053
Hurley告诉我关于投票的事
Hurley told me about the vote.

438
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:57,055
投票?  什么时候开始这里的人都要投票了
Vote? Since when did anyone around here vote?

439
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:09,097
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

440
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,088
根本就没什么投票
There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.

441
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:16,061
但是...这样不好么...和睦相处...
But...Wasn't it nice...Being nice?

442
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:18,094
你耍我让我变的像一个正直的人?
You tricked me into being decent?

443
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:22,080
- 这将是欺诈史上最槽糕的一次  - 这可不是欺诈  伙计
-That's gotta be the lamest con in the history of cons!  -It wasn't a con,dude.

444
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,023
如果你要成为我们暂时的领袖
If you're gonna be our temporary leader,

445
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:26,001
你必须要改变一切
you need to do some damage control.

446
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:28,061
领袖?  你到底在说些什么?
Leader? What the hell are you smoking?

447
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:33,070
Jack不在了  Locke不在了  Kate和Sayid...
Jack's gone. Locke's gone. Kate and Sayid...

448
00:34:34,058 --> 00:34:36,015
就剩下你了
You're all we got.

449
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:39,098
Paulo和Nikki死时  我们都指望你
When Paulo and Nikki died,we all looked to you.

450
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,097
而你又想偷走他们的钻石
Then again, you totally tried to steal their diamonds,

451
00:34:41,098 --> 00:34:44,018
但我们还是想指望你
but we wanted to look to you.

452
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:47,073
看看周围  你让所有人都很高兴
Look around.You made everyone happy.

453
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:52,083
只有今天  他们可以吃野猪肉
Just for today,they can eat boar,

454
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:56,097
开怀大笑  忘记他们的忧愁
laugh and forget that they're totally screwed.

455
00:34:57,027 --> 00:35:01,024
这些都是你的功劳  伙计 
And you did that for them, dude... You.

456
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,051
如果我不想当领袖呢?
And what if I don't want to be the leader?

457
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:09,036
我想Jack当初也不想当
Yeah, well, I don't think Jack wanted to, either.

458
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:12,088
你要试着习惯起来  老兄
Sucks for you, dude.

459
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:47,045
Sayid就在后院的一间屋子里
Sayid's in one of those backyards down there.

460
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:49,038
我会去找他
I'll go get him.

461
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:52,038
你应该去找Jack
You should get Jack.

462
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,028
Jack

463
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:10,077

464
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,084
Jack  醒醒  是我
Jack, wake up. It's me.

465
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:24,024
出什么事了?
What happened?

466
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,093
他们都走了
They all left.

467
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:29,007
都走了?
What?

都是因为我
Because of me.

469

我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

470

我应该听你的
I should've listened to you.

471
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,010
我不应该...

我只想回来救你...
I wanted to come back to help you...

473
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,050
但是你并不需要我
but you didn't need me to.

474
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,040
现在因为我  你不能回家了...
And now because of me, you can't go...

481
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,090
为什么?
Why?

482
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,040
你比我更了解她
