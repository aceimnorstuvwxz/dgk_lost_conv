00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,400
她的死是我的错 不是你的
It's not your fault she's dead. It's mine.

4
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:13,632
我说服她留下 因为我不想孤单的一个人
I convinced her to stay because I didn't want to be alone.

5
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:17,282
你在晚上之前就能到达寺庙

很抱歉让你看到我这个样子
I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

10
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:50,117
你去澳洲干嘛?
So what were you doing in Australia?

11
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:52,653
- 出差还是观光?  - 其实我是去徒步旅行

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:54,402

Are you okay?

17
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,446

21
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,267

22
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,124
婚礼在十月举行
The wedding is in October.

23
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:38,732

Look, I'm gonna just have to call you back. Yeah.

24
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:43,560
我烦死这些酒会承办人
I am so sick of caterers

25
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:44,738
和乐队了
and bands

26
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,845
还有选椅子背的花色
and picking fabrics for chair backs.

27
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:51,005
你觉得就请...
What do you say we just...

28
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,977
我父母和你父亲 在拉斯维加斯
get my parents and your dad

29
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,837
举办一个简单的婚礼 怎么样?
and do it shotgun style in Vegas?

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,322
不 Helen 你应该得到更好的
No. You deserve better than that, Helen.

31
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,153
我们能做到 我知道我们能
And we can do this. I know we can.

32
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:07,490
我喜欢...
I like...

33
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,098

this one.

34
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:13,957
- 那个?  - 我是说这个
- That one?  - I meant this one.

35
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:18,167
你真贴心
You are a very sweet man.

36
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:19,950
我知道
I know.

37
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:24,257
会议怎么样?
So how was the conference?

38
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,247
无聊
Boring.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,294
谁是Jack Shephard医生?
Who's, uh, who's Dr. Jack Shephard?

40
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,600
噢 填报失表的时候
Oh, I met him at lost luggage,

41
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,028
在丢失行李处遇到的
when I went to fill out the forms.

42
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:39,489
他... 他也丢了个东西
He... he lost something, too.

43
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:40,959
他是脊椎医生?
He's a spinal surgeon?

44
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:42,419
嗯 人很好
Yeah. Nice guy.

45
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,942
他给了我一次免费询诊
He offered me a free consult.

46
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,068
你应该给他打电话
You should call him.

47
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,593
哦 Helen 他只是出于礼貌
Oh, he was just being polite, Helen.

48
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,324
那又怎样?
So what?

49
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:53,493
我是说...
I mean...

50
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:58,842
你碰上一个脊椎医生 这多巧啊?
What are the odds of you just running into a spinal surgeon?

51
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:01,824
我是说 谁能解释?
I mean, who knows?

52
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,669
也许这就是命运
Maybe it's destiny.

53
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:07,288
没准儿是吧
Maybe it is.

54
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,067
好吧 Richard
All right, Richard.

55
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,717
是时候谈谈了
Time to talk.

56
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,436
欢迎回来 上校
Welcome back, Colonel.

57
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,679
哇
Wow.

58
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:15,453
你在澳洲晒得不错
You got a nice tan in Australia.

59
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:17,924
想我们吗?
Did you miss us?

60
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,488
当然想 Randy
Sure I did, Randy.

61
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:21,751
那么... John 会开得怎么样?
So... how was the conference, John?

62
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:24,714
噢 还行 我没学到什么东西
Uh, it was okay. I didn't really learn anything.

63
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:27,425
- 没有?  - 但是 呃 我认识了几个人
- No?  - But, um, I made some good contacts, though.

64
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,945
真的? 很有趣
Really? That's interesting.

65
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:33,002
是这样 Ken Fisher打电话说 你取消了跟他的午餐
See, uh, Ken Fisher called and said you had to cancel your lunch with him.

66
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,141
是的 是的 我那天不太舒服
Right, right. I was a little under the weather that day.

67
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:40,516
- 哦... 可能是时差  - 真的吗?
- Uh...  probably jet lag.  - Really?

68
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,240
因为后来会议人员给我打电话
Cause then the seminar people called

69
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,793
说你没有拿你的入场券
and said you hadn't picked up your credentials.

70
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,937
我查了一下
I did some checking,

71
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,691
你好像什么活动都没参加
and it seems that you didn't attend a single event.

72
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,955
我们是公费把你送去悉尼的...
Since we sent you to Sydney on the company's dime...

73
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:53,079
你到底去哪了?
where the hell were you?

74
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,290
Randy 我很抱歉 我...
Look, Randy, I'm really sorry. I'm...

75
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,095
为什么不把这当作假期呢?
Why don't we just call it my vacation week?

76
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,552
我认为你想在10月份放假
I thought you wanted that vacation week in October?

77
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,826
你知道的 为了你的婚礼
You know, for your wedding.

78
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:05,084
求你了 Randy 我... 我知道不应该说谎
Please, Randy. I... I know I shouldn't have lied.

79
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,934
但是我去哪了...
But where I was...

80
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:11,509
是个人隐私
It's personal,

81
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,526
而且我... 我真的不想说这件事
and I... and I really don't want to talk about it.

82
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:14,437
好吧 John
Okay, John.

83
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,378
嘿 你被解雇了
Hey, you're fired.

84
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:28,490
渴吗?
Thirsty?

85
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:38,937
Richard 很抱歉我打了你的嗓喉咙
Richard, I'm sorry I hit you in the throat

86
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:41,145
还把你拉出沙滩 但我必须要做些什么
and dragged you off the beach, but I had to do something.

87
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:45,095
- 你想干嘛?  - 我一直想...
- What do you want?  - What I've always wanted...

88
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,597
让你跟我走
for you to come with me.

89
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:50,830
为什么你这么像John Locke?
Why do you look like John Locke?

90
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:53,966
我知道他会带我找到Jacob
I knew he'd get me access to Jacob,

91
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,256
因为John是接班人
because John's a candidate,

92
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:59,275
至少曾经是
or at least he was a candidate.

93
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,865
你的意思是...
What do you mean...

94
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:04,696
你说什么"接班人"?
What do you mean, "a candidate"?

95
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,860
- Jacob没有告诉你这件事吗?  - 告诉我什么?
- Didn't Jacob tell you any of this?  - Any of what?

96
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,362
哦 Richard 我很抱歉
Oh, Richard, I'm sorry.

97
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,575
你是指 你一直按照他的吩咐去做
You mean, you've been doing everything he told you

98
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,660
而他却始终没有告诉你为什么?
all this time, and he never said why?

99
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:21,211
我绝不会那样对你
I would never have done that to you.

100
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,395
我也绝不会对你有所隐瞒
I would never have kept you in the dark.

101
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,620
那... 你会怎么做?
And... and what would you have done?

102
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,076
我会对你以礼相待
I would have treated you with respect.

103
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:30,621
跟我来
Come with me,

104
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:34,375
我保证会告诉你一切
and I promise I'll tell you everything.

105
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,111
不
No.

106
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:40,184
Richard 你确定吗?
Are you sure about that, Richard?

107
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:44,353
机不可失 失不再来
Because people seldom get a second chance.

108
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:47,448
我不会跟你去任何地方
I'm not going anywhere with you.

109
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:51,934
那好吧...
All right...

110
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,361
怎么了?
What?

111
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:11,388
待会见 Richard 我去去就来
I'll be seeing you, Richard, sooner than you think.

112
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:42,325
打扰你了吗?
Am I interrupting?

113
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:46,079
告诉我 他们发生了什么事
Tell me what happened to them.

114
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,830
好吧
All right.

115
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,190
你有很合理的理由 质疑我所说的话
There's a fairly reasonable chance that you won't believe me.

116
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:00,573
说来听听
Try me.

117
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,014
是John Locke杀了他们
John Locke killed them.

118
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:06,381
- 全是他一人所为吗?  - 是的
- All by himself?  - Yes.

119
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,436
他化作一股黑烟
He turned into a pillar of black smoke,

120
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,938
就在我眼前 把他们全杀了
and he killed them right before my eyes.

121
00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:14,368
Jacob也被杀了吗?
Did it kill Jacob as well?

122
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,552
是的
Yes.

123
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,612
那他的尸体在哪儿?
Then where's his body?

124
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:22,261
Locke将他踢入火堆 现在早已化成了灰烬
Locke kicked him into the fire, and he burned away.

125
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:43,441
Locke... 你知道他为什么 将Richard带进丛林吗?
Locke... do you know why he carried Richard out into the jungle?

126
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:52,291
他是在招募新人
He's recruiting.

127
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:56,497
你好啊 James
Hello, James.

128
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:05,985
我以为你死了呢
I thought you were dead.

129
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:08,874
是啊
I am,

130
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,992
我就在这儿等死呢
here's to bein' dead.

131
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,798
这样非常好啊
You're taking this extremely well.

132
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:51,373
什么非常好?
Taking what extremely well?

133
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:52,298
我还活着站在这里啊
That I'm here.

134
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:55,214
我才不在乎你是死是活
I don't give a damn if you're dead

135
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:57,834
你是时空旅行...
or time travelin' or...

136
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,541
或是被圣诞节幽灵带走 于我何干
the ghost of christmas past.

137
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,869
我只在意这杯威士忌
All I care about is this whiskey.

138
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,073
来 干完这杯
So bottom's up,

139
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:09,045
然后滚出我的屋子
then get the hell out of my house.

140
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:15,840
这间屋子不是你的 James
This isn't your house, James.

141
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:18,760
不是我的又怎样
The hell it ain't.

142
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:22,451
不 你仅仅是在这儿住过一段时间
No. You just lived here for a while.

143
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,682
这屋子永远不会是你的
This was never your house.

144
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,239
你是谁?
Who are you?

145
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:32,274
你一定不是John Locke
You sure as hell ain't John Locke.

146
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:34,922
为什么这么说?
What makes you say that?

147
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:36,611
因为Locke很胆小
Cause Locke was scared,

148
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,115
就算他佯装镇定 也一样
even when he was pretending he wasn't.

149
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:42,357
但是你...
But you...

150
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:47,591
你并不胆小
You ain't scared.

151
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:57,520
如果我告诉你 我是唯一通晓玄机的人
What if I told you I was the person who could answer

152
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,051
又该怎么说呢?
the most important question in the world?

153
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,608
什么玄机?
And what question is that?

154
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:14,467
你为什么会在这所岛上?
Why are you on this island?

155
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:16,928
我会在这所岛上
I'm on this island

156
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,107
是因为我乘坐的飞机坠毁了
because my plane crashed,

157
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:21,485
飞机在空中炸毁
'cause my flight blew up,

158
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,291
还有 我驾驶的直升机载荷过重
because the helicopter I was on was ridin' one too heavy.

159
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,095
那不是你在这里的原因
That's not why you're here.

160
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,839
如果你愿意跟我来...
And if you come with me...

161
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,519
我就能向你证实
I can prove it.

162
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:44,581
好吧 我得先穿好裤子
Well, I guess I better put some pants on.

163
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,460
好的
Okay.

164
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,502
好的
Okay.

165
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,751
靠!

166
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:19,295
噢 去死吧!
Aw, damn it!

167
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,439
老兄?
Dude?

168
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:28,846
老兄!
Dude!

169
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,040
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

170
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,167
我要干什么? 你他妈的要干什么?
What am I doing? What the hell are you doing?

171
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,232
你这辈子停过车吗?
You ever park a car in your life?

172
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:40,733
你几乎占了我的车位!
You're practically in my spot!

173
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,162
- 我很抱歉  - 哼
- I'm sorry.  - Yeah.

174
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:44,981
但是 看 那边有一个残疾人专用停车位
But, you know, there's a handicap spot right over here.

175
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:48,679
是 是有 但有谁规定我必须停在那了
Yeah. Yeah, okay. But I don't have to park there.

176
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,576
我可以想停哪儿就停哪儿
I can park anywhere I want.

177
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,042
而你 只需要把车停在自己的车位里
You need to stay inside the lines.

178
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:54,351
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

179
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:56,311
他们本该给我预留一个车位的
They were supposed to reserve a spot for me.

180
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:59,982
可是 哎  所以我只能停这儿了
So, you know, I just parked here.

181
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:03,840
我从来没见过你 你在这个公司工作吗?
I haven't seen you before. You work here?

280
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:14,092
如果你想做建筑 你就做吧
If you want to work construction, you got it.

281
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:15,854
- 谢谢  - 我还没说完
- Thank you.  - I'm not finished.

282
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:18,346
明天我会让你到工地去
I will send you down there tomorrow,

283
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:20,234
后天
and then the day after,

284
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:22,663
你再来我的办公室
you will be back in my office.

285
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:25,364
听着...
Look...

286
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:30,859
Locke先生 我们还是比较现实一点吧
Mr. Locke, let's try to be a little more realistic.

287
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:33,633
你又对现实有多了解?
And what do you know about realistic?

288
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,791
我患了癌症
I have cancer.

289
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:42,075
晚期
Terminal cancer.

290
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:45,526
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

291
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:47,486
当大夫第一次告诉我时
When the doctors first told me,

292
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:50,541
我很难接受
I had a hard time accepting it.

293
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:55,129
但最终 我接受了事实
But eventually, I got past the denial part

294
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:00,478
并且我准备好好珍惜 剩下的一分一秒
and I got back to living whatever life I've got left.

295
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,502
所以...
So...

296
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,766
要不我们帮你找一份
How about we find you a job

297
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:08,539
你适合的工作?
you can do?

298
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,695
你看书么?
Do you read?

299
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:18,311
你说啥?
Excuse me?

300
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,553
你看不看书?
Books. You read books?

301
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:22,295
当然 谁不看书?
Sure. Who doesn't?

302
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:27,644
我最喜欢的是斯坦贝克的 "人与鼠"
My favorite's Steinbeck, "Of Mice and Men."

303
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:29,083
你听说过么?
You know that one?

304
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:32,023
没 跟我不是一个年代
Nope. A little after my time.

305
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,169
讲的是两个人George和Lennie
It's about these two guys, George and Lennie.

306
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,245
Lennie反应有点慢
Lennie's kind of slow,

307
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:42,747
会给George惹麻烦
causing George problems.

308
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,449
所以George带他走进森林
So George walks him out in the woods,

309
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,701
叫他朝那边看 并且描绘说
tells him to look out yonder and picture

310
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,860
他们将来要在那儿 住漂亮的小房子
the pretty little house they're gonna live in one day.

311
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:53,769
之后他朝Lennie脑袋后面开了一枪
and he shoots Lennie in the back of the head.

312
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,683
好吧 听起来不是个大团圆结局
Well, that doesn't sound like a happy ending.

313
00:23:56,965 --> 00:23:59,437
的确
It isn't.

314
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,840
- 你在想什么呢 James?  - 我在寻思如果我朝你
- What's on your mind, James?  - I'm wondering what would happen to you

315
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,195
脑袋后面开一枪 你会怎么样
if I put a bullet in your head.

316
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,542
嗯 要不我们试试?
Mm. Why don't we find out?

317
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:19,394
你到底是什么东西?
What are you?

318
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:23,961
我是个被困住的人
What I am is trapped.

319
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:27,496
被困住了很长一段时间
and I've been trapped for so long

320
00:24:27,496 --> 00:24:30,582
以至于 我都忘了自由的感觉
that I don't even remember what it feels like to be free.

321
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,846
也许你能理解
Maybe you can understand that.

322
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,299
我被困之前 我是一个普通人 像你一样 James
But before I was trapped, I was a man, James, just like you.

323
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:41,020
我才不信
I have a hard time believing that.

324
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:43,377
好吧 随你信不信 但那是事实
Well, you can believe whatever you want, but that's the truth.

325
00:24:44,878 --> 00:24:47,443
我知道什么是 快乐
I know what it's like to feel joy,

326
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:51,009
痛苦 愤怒 恐惧...
to feel pain, anger, fear...

327
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:53,991
什么是被背叛的滋味
to experience betrayal.

328
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,922
我也知道 失去深爱之人的感觉
I know what it's like to lose someone you love.

329
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,077
如果你要开枪 就动手吧
If you wanna shoot me, shoot me.

330
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:07,310
但是你已经离得很近了 James
But you're so close, James.

331
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:11,428
现在回头 太可惜了
It would be such a shame to turn back now.

332
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,743
为什么一开始 你们要把他带到雕像那儿去?
Why did you have to bring him to the statue in the first place?

333
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:41,171
因为那儿的人们
Because the people there

334
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:43,152
需要知道他们的敌人长什么样
need to see the face of what they're up against.

335
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,655
那又怎么样能阻止他们的敌人
And what's to stop what they're up against

336
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:47,063
变模样呢?
from changing his face?

337
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:49,231
他现在变不了了
He can't. Not anymore.

338
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,151
这条路他走不通了
He's stuck this way.

339
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,491
有没有人想说些什么?
Does anyone want to say anything?

340
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:49,289
都没人认识他吗?
Didn't any of you know him?

341
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:55,921
好吧 我认识他
All right, I knew him.

342
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,667
John Locke是一位...
John Locke was a...

343
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:13,344
信徒 他有自己的信仰
a believer. He was a man of faith.

344
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:14,325
他...
He was...

345
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:17,526
我永远成为不了...
a much better man...

346
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,206
他那样的人...
than I will ever be...

347
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,431
我非常抱歉 杀害了他
And I'm very sorry I murdered him.

348
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,300
这鬼葬礼是我参加过的
This is the weirdest damn funeral

349
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:43,847
最诡异的了
I've ever been to.

350
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:37,052
你好 Shephard医生办公室
Hello. Dr. Shephard's office.

351
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:38,856
喂?
Hello?

352
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:40,504
需要找谁?
Can I help you?

353
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:43,215
不 我谁都不找
No. No, you can't.

354
00:28:45,602 --> 00:28:46,499
你在跟谁打电话?
Who was that on the phone?

355
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:48,366
呃 没人
Mm, no one.

356
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,660
没人?
No one?

357
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,120
John 我刚才确实听到你在讲电话
John, I just heard you talking on the phone.

358
00:28:55,612 --> 00:28:56,947
我 呃
I was, uh,

359
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,241
我刚才是打给Shephard医生的
I was calling Dr. Shephard.

360
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:06,655
好啊 不错啊 你准备什么时候去见他?
Well, good for you. when are you gonna see him?

361
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:07,958
我不打算见他
I'm not gonna see him.

362
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:13,172
- 呃 我... 不懂 你为什么不打算...  - 我被解雇了 Helen
- Well, I... I don't understand. Why wouldn't you want...  - I got fired, Helen.

363
00:29:20,077 --> 00:29:21,075
来了!
Coming!

364
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:24,850
女士? 我是大洋航空快件员
Ma'am? Oceanic courier.

365
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:27,707
这是之前我们弄丢的行李
I'm delivering your lost luggage.

366
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:28,958
好的
All right.

367
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:33,067
麻烦您在这签个字
Sign here to accept the delivery.

368
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:38,662
- 谢谢  - 好的 谢谢
- Thanks.  - Okay, thanks.

369
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:48,922
好吧 John
Okay, John.

370
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,509
现在跟我谈谈吧
Now talk to me.

371
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:55,846
你为什么被解雇了?
How did you get fired?

372
00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:02,654
我跟Randy撒谎了 我没去参加悉尼的会议
I lied to Randy. I didn't go to the conference in Sydney.

373
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:04,865
什么?
What?

374
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:08,160
Helen 把箱子打开
Open the case, Helen.

375
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:37,256
这... 这些是干嘛的?
W... What are these for?

376
00:30:37,851 --> 00:30:39,592
我的徒步旅行
My walkabout.

377
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:41,156
你... 你... 的什么?
Your... y... your what?

378
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:42,272
徒步旅行
My walkabout.

379
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,900
内地的一次冒险
An adventure in the outback

380
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,610
在野外生存
Man against nature.

381
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:50,374
但他们不让我去
But they wouldn't let me go.

382
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:53,919
所以... 我坐着向他们喊
And... and I sat there yelling at them,

383
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,253
对着他们吼
shouting at them,

384
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,766
别跟我说 什么事情我做不了
that they couldn't tell me what I can't do.

385
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,051
可他们说得对
But they were right.

386
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,996
我受够了想象
I'm sick of imagining

387
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:11,376
能站起来之后的生活 Helen
what my life could be out of this chair, Helen,

388
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:12,834
受够了想象...
what it would be like to...

389
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:16,400
能站起来和你结婚
walk down the aisle with you,

390
00:31:17,282 --> 00:31:19,215
因为这根本不可能发生
'cause it's not gonna happen.

391
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:25,638
但如果你想让我多看几个医生
So if you need me to see more doctors,

392
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:27,880
呃... 多咨询几次
if, uh... have more consults,

393
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,115
如果你想要我站起来
if you need me to get out of this chair,

394
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:30,831
我不会怪你
I don't blame you.

395
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,523
可我不希望你用尽一生
But I don't want you to spend your life

396
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:35,608
来等待这个奇迹 Helen 因为...
waiting for a miracle, Helen, because...

397
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:39,414
根本就没有奇迹
there is no such thing.

398
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,524
奇迹是有的 John
There are miracles, John.

399
00:31:58,548 --> 00:32:00,654
可我唯一...
And the only thing...

400
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,246
在等待的...
I was ever waitin' for...

401
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,552
就是你
was you.

402
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,932
景色不错
Nice view.

403
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,924
接下来呢?
Now what?

404
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:44,374
现在我们下去
Now we go down.

405
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:48,201
下去哪儿?
Down where?

406
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:51,892
下去那儿
Down there.

407
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:56,365
无意冒犯 你是已经死了
No offense, but you already died,

408
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,659
你当然不觉得有什么大不了
so it's great that this is not a big deal for you.

409
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,828
可你要是认为 我会先下去
But if you think I'm climbin' down there first,

410
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:02,413
你就真他妈疯了
you are off your damn nut.

411
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:04,060
没关系 我先下去
It's no problem. I'll go first.

412
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,732
你下来吗 James?
You comin', James?

413
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,393
James啊!
James!

414
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:15,073
Locke啊!
Locke!

415
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:20,840
跳呀 抓住我 快点!
Jump. I got you. come on!

416
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:23,248
快点 抓住我! 快点!
Come on, I got you! come on!

417
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,125
快点!
Come on!

418
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,430
呃! 快点!
Uhh! Come on!

419
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:29,400
啊! 小心!
Aah! Look out!

420
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,283
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

421
00:35:32,462 --> 00:35:33,839

可我还要再说多少次才行?
but how many times do we have to go over this?

444
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:28,523
如果谁喝完最后一杯咖啡

Tea?

454
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,751
一个曾叫"Jacob"的人
His name was Jacob.

455
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:11,368
曾叫"Jacob"?

00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:14,715
他昨天死了

457
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:23,631
你看起来倒不是太难过

458
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:26,081
我不难过
I'm not.

459
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,919
为什么这些名字都被划掉了?

没有都划掉

462
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,460
是指Jack Shephard?

不只他

464
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:57,049
"Reyes."也没
"Reyes."

465
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:58,529
就是Hugo 对吧?

00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,247
就是你
That would be you.

476
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:48,832
他把我名字写在这面墙上干嘛?
Why would he write my name on this wall?

477
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:51,908
- 我又没见过他  - 哦 不 你肯定见过他
- I never even met the guy.  - Oh, no, I'm sure you did meet Jacob.

478
00:39:58,198 --> 00:39:59,999
就在你生命的某个重要时刻 James
At some point in your life, James,

479
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:01,334
很可能在你还很小
probably when you were young,

480
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:04,848
很可怜 很脆弱的时候 他找过你
when you were miserable and vulnerable, he came to you.

481
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:06,881
他操纵着你
He manipulated you,

482
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:09,300
把你当成木偶那样操纵
pulled your strings like you were a puppet.

483
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,710
结果 你以为是你自己做的那些选择
And as a result, choices that you thought you made

484
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,535
事实上根本就不是选择
were never really choices at all.

485
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:17,507
他在逼迫你 James
He was pushing you, James.

486
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:19,696
逼迫你...
Pushing you...

487
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:22,407
来到这个岛上
to the island.

488
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,189
那他究竟为什么要这么做?
Why the hell would he do that?

489
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:29,129
因为你是接班人之一
Because you're a candidate.

490
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:31,256
什么的接班人?
Candidate for what?

491
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:34,426
他认为自己是这个地方的守护者
He thought he was the protector of this place.

492
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:36,804
而你 James 已经被提名...
And you, James, have been nominated...

493
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:39,598
来接手那份使命
to take over that job.

494
00:40:40,516 --> 00:40:41,485
那意味着什么?
What does that mean?

495
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:43,195
意味着你有三个选择
It means you've got three choices.

496
00:40:43,696 --> 00:40:47,554
第一个选择 你可以什么都不做...
First, you can do nothing and...

497
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:51,110
静观其变
see how all this plays out.

498
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:54,759
这样很可能
And possibly,

499
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:56,500
你的名字...
your name...

500
00:40:57,762 --> 00:40:59,337
就会被划掉
will get crossed out.

501
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,279
第二个选择就是
Second option,

502
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:05,687
你可以接下这份使命
you can accept the job,

503
00:41:05,687 --> 00:41:09,733
成为新的Jacob 来守护这个岛
become the new Jacob and protect the island.

504
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,235
守护它什么?
Protect it from what?

505
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,809
没有什么 James
From nothing, James.

506
00:41:13,706 --> 00:41:14,957
这就是那个天大的笑话
That's the joke.

507
00:41:14,957 --> 00:41:17,168
根本没什么好守护的
There's nothing to protect it from.

508
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:18,513
就是个破岛而已
It's just a damn island.

509
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:22,965
没有Jacob或你 或其他任何被他荒废生命的人
And it will be perfectly fine without Jacob or you

510
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:27,928
这岛都会好好的 继续存在
or any of the other people whose lives he wasted.

511
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,091
你说了有三个选择
You said there were three choices.

512
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:37,251
第三个 James 就是我们离开
The third choice, James, is that we just go.

513
00:41:38,649 --> 00:41:40,744
只要我们离开这个岛
We just get the hell off this island

514
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:43,622
永远地忘掉它
and we never look back.

515
00:41:45,113 --> 00:41:46,813
那怎么才能做到?
And how do we do that?

516
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:50,556
我们一起
Together.

517
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,744
你说呢 James?
So what do you say, James?

518
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:06,362
准备好回家了吗?
Are you ready to go home?

519
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:19,241
管他呢 好的

Hell, yes.
