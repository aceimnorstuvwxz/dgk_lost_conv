你必须先向我解释...

189
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,290
一个慈善活动
one of her charity events,

190
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,060
然后 呃 那孩子异想天开

191
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,850
想把古典音乐和现代摇滚 合二为一

And now if I don't get this junkie to my wife's event,

196
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,540
她会 说白点儿就是 跟我没完

但我需要某个我信任的人 去做这事
but I need someone I can trust to do the job right.

246
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,380
或许我也看到过

坐在我前面两排... 带着手铐...
two rows in front of me...  in handcuffs...

251

He looked at me,

253

知道我持有毒品

要是我没有采取行动 我就要被抓起来了
If I didn't take action, I'd be caught.

255
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,490
所以我站起来 去了洗手间...
So I got up, went to the lav...

256
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,960
打算把那些小袋子
proceeded to eliminate the evidence

257
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,940
吞下去 以销毁罪证
by swallowing my stash.

258
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,570
就在那个时候
And at that exact moment,

259
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,630
我们遇到了气流
we hit turbulence.

260
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,660
我便呛到了
I choked.

261
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,280
一整袋海洛因 卡在了我的喉咙里
The entire bag of heroin is stuck in my throat.

262
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,160
呃 这下惨了 我眼前一黑
It's, uh, it's over. Everything starts to go dark.

263
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,650
便滑进了一个深渊 然后...
I'm slippin' into the abyss, and then...

264
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,700
我看见了... 她
I see... her.

265
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,320
"她"?
"Her"?

266
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,470

金发碧眼
Blonde.

268
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,200
美若天仙
Rapturously beautiful.

269
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,200
我认识她
And I know her.

270
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,860
我们在一起
We're together.

271
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,720
就像...
It's like...

272
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,750
一直在一起 并且...
You've always been, and...

273
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,860
永远会在一起
always will be.

274
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,840
这种...
This...

275
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,050
感觉 这种...
feeling, this...

276
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,010
爱情
love.

277
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,480
正当我快迷醉的时候
And just as I'm about to be engulfed by it.

278
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,310
我睁开双眼
I open my eyes,

279
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,480
那个蠢货
and this sodding idiot

280
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,350
站在那儿 问我有没有事
is standing there, asking me if I'm okay.

281
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,740
但我确实看到了
But I saw it.

282
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,480
就那么一会 我看到那副景象了
Just for a moment, I saw what it looked like.

283
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,240
就像是...
Well, that's just...

284
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,450
一首诗 哥们
poetry, brother.

285
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,810
你应该... 为它谱一首曲子
You know, you should... you should write a song about that.

286
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,330
对 对 对 对 我知道你什么意思
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're saying.

287
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,690
"可怜的想自杀的摇滚明星"
"Poor suicidal rock star."

288
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,020
但我见到了一些真实的东西 我见到了真相
But I've seen something real. I've seen the truth.

289
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,850
不 那不是真相
No, that's not the truth.

290
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,340
你想知道真相吗 Pace?
You wanna know the real truth, Pace?

291
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,580
现在你可以选择
Right now you have a choice.

292
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,910
要么继续喝酒 要么你跟我走
You can keep on drinkin', or you can come with me.

293
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,820
在你做出选择之前 你要知道 如果你留在这儿
Now before you make your choice, realize that if you stay here,

294
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,880
那结果就会像是
it will very likely result

295
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,720
你的音乐生涯终结那样
in the extermination of your musical career.

296
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,370
如果我跟你走呢?
And if I go with you?

297
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,560
只要二十分钟
20 minutes,

298
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,790
你就能在一家五星级酒店里享福啦
you'll be luxuriating in a five-star hotel,

299
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,820
就在前面的海港那儿 Charles Widmore
right on the harbor front. Charles Widmore,

300
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,750
这座城市中最有权势的人之一
one of the most powerful men in this town,

301
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,340
会请你帮个忙
will owe you favor.

302
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,760
看上去没得选嘛
Doesn't really seem like a choice.

303
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,010
天无绝人之路 哥们
There's always a choice, brother.

304
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,020
# 芸芸众生 #
# You all, everybody #

305
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,950
- # 芸芸众生 #  - 那是我的乐队
- # You all, everybody #  - That's my band.

306
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,410
- # 貌似愚蠢 #  - 驱动轴
- # Acting like you're stupid people #  - Drive shaft.

307
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,400
- 我们的第一支单曲  - # 衣着昂贵 #
- Our first single.  - # Wearing expensive clothes #

308
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,280
每件事的开端都那么完美
The beginning of everything great.

309
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,870
# 芸芸众生 #
# You all, everybody #

310
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,150
# 芸芸众生 #
# You all, everybody #

311
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,450
你喜欢吗?
You like it?

312
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,760
- # 芸芸众生 #  - 当然 唱得挺好
- # You all, everybody #  - Sure. For what it is.

313
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,340
我为你感到可惜 伙计
I feel sorry for you, mate.

314
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,020
你觉得你很幸福 觉得你拥有了一切
You think you're happy. You think you got it all.

315
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,030
这就是... 你的生活
This... your life.

316
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,360
但事实并非如此
But you don't.

317
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,630
嗯 为什么 难道这一切都不是真的?
Hmm. Why, because none of it's real?

318
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,410
# 芸芸众生... #
# You all... #

319
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,940
这样好了 Hume先生 我给你一个选择 怎么样?
All right, Mr. Hume. How about I offer you a choice?

320
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,950
什么选择?
What's that?

321
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,720
要么我给你展示一下我所说的幻象
I can either show you what I'm talking about,

322
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,340
要么你下车
or you can get out of the car.

323
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,690
你怎么觉得我会下...
Why in god's name would I want to get out of...

324
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,970
Charlie啊! Charlie啊!

来人啊 该死!

330
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,266
你在事故中 受到严重撞击
You sustained a pretty bad bump in your accident.

331
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,656
感到恶心吗?

- 视像有重影吗?  - 没有
- Double vision?  - No.

334
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,556
听着 我要找到我带过来的那个男的
Listen, I need to find the man that I was brought in here with.

335
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:08,456
有幻觉吗?
How about hallucinations?

336
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:13,456
你指什么?
What do you mean?

337
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:16,486
幻觉 看到了一些并不存在的东西
Hallucinations. Seeing things that aren't there.

338
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:20,466
呃...
Um...

339
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:24,026
我不知道
I'm not sure.

340
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,906
你的CAT扫描没有结论
Well, your C.A.T. scan was inconclusive.

341
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:28,886
我送你下楼 去做一个核磁共振
I'm gonna send you downstairs for an M.R.I.

342
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:30,936
不 我没空做这个
No, I don't have time for this.

343
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:33,896
- 我要找到我带过来的那个男的  - 在我们确诊你脑部情况之前
- I need to find the man I came in here with.  - I'm afraid you're not finding anyone

344
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:37,576
恐怕你是找不到任何人的
till we know what's going on inside your brain.

345
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:41,096
你佩戴了金属制品吗 比如钥匙或者链子?
Are you wearing any metal, carrying keys or chains?

I see you didn't list an emergency contact.

349
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:51,326
没有朋友或者家属吗?
No friends or family?

350
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,306
呃...
Um...

351
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:56,226
就写我老板的名字吧... Charles Widmore
Just put down my employer...  Charles Widmore.

352

这机器很吵
This machine is super loud.

353
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:02,526
你要戴上这个
You're gonna want these.

354
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:09,156
还有这个开关
And you need the button.

355
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:11,226
- 开关?  - 应急开关
- Button?  - Panic button.

356
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:13,716
你要停下来的话 就按一下 但尽量不要按
You need to stop, press it. But try not to,

357
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:15,796
因为那样我们就得重来一遍了
'cause we'll have to start all over again from the beginning.

358
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:16,786
我会在那边那个小房间里
I'll be in that booth over there.

359
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:20,126
你听得到我的 三十分钟 准备好了吗?
You'll be able to hear me. 30 minutes, okay?

360
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,646

- If you'd just give me his room number...  - If you're not a relative, that's confidential information.

371
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:40,976
我们是一起出的事 我要见他
Look, we were in an accident together. I need to see him.

372
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,206
对不起 先生 实在帮不了你
Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

373
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:45,496

- 你为什么要跑啊?  - 这里没人能帮得了我 让我走吧
- Why you running?  - 'Cause no one here can help me. Now let me go.

- Why'd you try and kill me?  - I didn't try and kill you.

这都不重要
This doesn't matter.

401
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:24,436
统统不重要
None of this matters.

402
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,646
重要的是 我们都有那种感觉
All that matters is that we felt it.

403

00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,140
他撞倒了急救推车旁的一个医生
He knocked over a doctor with a bloody crash cart

409
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,360
- 接着就跑出了医院  - 你就让他这么走了?
- and then ran out of hospital.  - And you let him go?

410
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,340
他是个把我车开到海里去的瘾君子 Charles
He's a junkie who drove my car into the ocean, Charles.

411
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,240
- 顺便告诉你 我没事 谢谢  - 你能活着我很高兴 Desmond
- I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking.  - And I'm thrilled you survived, Desmond.

412
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,990
但我吩咐你一件事的时候 我希望你能干好它
But when I give you a job to do, I expect you to do it.

413
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,580
- 恕我直言 先生 这不过是一场音乐会  - 我跟你说 Desmond
- With all due respect, sir, it's just a bloody concert.  - I'll tell you what, Desmond.

414
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,390
如果你不能把Pace带来的话
If you can't deliver Pace,

415
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,560
你不如自己去跟Widmore夫人说 这不过是一场音乐会吧?
why don't you tell Mrs. Widmore it's only a bloody concert?

416
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,570
Hume先生
Mr. Hume.

417
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,750
你还没见过老板的妻子 是吧?
So you've never met the boss's wife, huh?

418
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,120
是的
No.

419
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
祝你好运
Good luck.

420
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,700
请你告诉我
Please tell me how it is

421
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,820
你们的工作人员 怎么会没有注意到
that someone in your line of work is not aware

422
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,610
黄油刀是朝右摆的?
that the butter knife is placed handle to the right?

423
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,370
- 刀锋要像这样朝左  - 好的
- Blade facing left just so.  - Okay.

424
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,130
真要命
For god sake.

425
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,690
您是Widmore夫人吗?
Mrs. Widmore?

426
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,240
什么事?
Yes?

427
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,690
我叫Desmond Hume 我替您的丈夫工作
My name is Desmond Hume. I work for your husband.

428
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,170
哦 我知道了 Hume先生
Oh, of course, Mr. Hume.

429
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,770
Charles时常跟我提起你
Charles has told me so much about you.

430
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,780
我们之前居然没见过面
It's a travesty we haven't met before.

431
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,000
现在终于有机会了
Well, it's about time.

432
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,670
我深有同感 Widmore夫人
Well, the feeling is mutual, Mrs. Widmore.

433
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,640
哦 别这样 叫我Eloise就可以了
Oh, please. It's Eloise.

434
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,300
Eloise啊
Eloise.

435
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,900
呃 是什么风让Charles
So, uh, what crisis forced Charles

436
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,420
把他最得力的助手
to send his best fix-it man

437
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,340
吹到慈善舞会上来了?
into the bowels of charity balls?

438
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,750
Eloise 呃...
Well, Eloise, um...

439
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,050
我深感抱歉
I'm deeply sorry,

440
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,330
但似乎 呃 "驱动轴"乐队
but it appears as if, uh, Drive Shaft

441
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,620
不能和贵公子同台演出了
won't be able to perform alongside your son.

442
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,050
对此 呃 这都是我的责任...
And, um, I take full responsibility...

443
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,210
不用为此担心
Don't worry about it.

444
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,640
您说什么?
Excuse me?

445
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,680
我儿子会理解的
Oh, my son will understand.

446
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,470
我觉得 假如有人雇用了所谓的摇滚明星
I suppose if one employs so-called rock stars,

447
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,010
说不准会发生些什么事呢
a certain unpredictability comes with the territory.

448
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,680
是的 您... 您不生气吗?
Yeah. Y... you're not angry?

449
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,410
哦 亲爱的 我一点都不生气
Oh, not at all, dear.

450
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,830
所有事情都是注定的
What happened, happened.

451
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,270
Hume先生 非常感谢你
Thank you so much, Mr. Hume,

452
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,520
能亲自来告诉我这些事
For coming and telling me in person.

453
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,580
- 非常高兴见到你  - 我也是 谢谢你
- A pleasure meeting you.  - And you. Thank you.

454
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,930
请把那些插花放在中间
Uh, center that flower arrangement, please.

455
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,440
祝您有个愉快的夜晚
Have a good evening.

456
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,180
谢谢你
Thank you.

Pepper, Nicholas... plus one.

461
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,410
不好意思
Excuse me.

462
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,190
打扰一下 呃...
I'm sorry. Um...

463
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,570
你刚才有念到"Penny"这个人吗?
Did you just say "Penny"?

464
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,470
- 你是哪位?  - 喔 我是为Widmore先生办事的 我可以看一下那个名单吗?
- And who are you?  - Um, I work for Mr. Widmore. May I see the list?

465
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,250
你当然不能看了
You absolutely may not.

466
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,340
这个名单是保密的
That list is confidential.

467
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,680
请原谅
Begging your pardon,

468
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,740
我整天都在跟绝密的文件打交道...
I... I'm entrusted with confidential items every day...

469
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,180
你是在质疑我吗?
Are you questioning me?

470
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,950
不敢 我... 仅仅是想看下那个名单而已
No, I... just want to look at one name on that list.

471
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,750
- 如果有什么原因 不方便让我查看...  - 跟我来
- And if, for some reason, that's a problem...  - Come with me.

472
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,110
所有人都出去 马上
Out, everyone. Now.

473
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,210
是这样的 我...
Look, I'm...

474
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,790
如果我越权了 我向您道歉 但是我仅仅...
I'm sorry if I've overstepped my bounds, but I just...

475
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,190
住嘴吧 Hume
Stop talking, Hume.

476
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,920
我已经很清楚你在说什么了 现在你听我说
I've heard what you've had to say. Now you listen to me.

477
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,510
我要你停下来
I want you to stop.

478
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,940
停下来? 停... 停下来什么?
Stop? S... stop what?

479
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,290
很明显 已经有人影响到了你对事物的看法
Someone has clearly affected the way you see things.

480
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,260
这是个很严重的问题 事实上 这是种侵害
This is a serious problem. It is, in fact, a violation.

481
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,760
所以不管你现在在做什么
So whatever you're doing,

482
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,980
也不管你想要追寻什么
whatever it is you think you're looking for...

483
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,030
你需要停下你追寻的脚步
you need to stop looking for it.

484
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,720
Widmore女士...
Do you...

485
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,050
你知道我是在追寻什么吗?
do you know what I'm looking for, Mrs. Widmore?

486
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,990
我找不到你还需要去追寻其它东西的理由
I don't know why you're looking for anything.

487
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,690
你有完美的人生
You have the perfect life.

488
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,730
至关重要的是 你已经得到了
On top of it, you've managed to attain

489
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,610
你最渴望的东西...
the thing you wanted more than anything...

490
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,970
那就是我丈夫的赞许
My husband's approval.

491
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,540
您是如何得知我需要什么的?
How do you know what I want?

492
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,420
我就是知道
Because I bloody do.

493
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,560
我需要看看那个名单...
I need to see that list...

494
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,890
除非你告诉我 为什么我不能看
Or you need to tell me why I can't.

495
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,690
Desmond 你不能看 是因为你还没有准备好
You can't because you're not ready yet, Desmond.

496
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,010
准备好?
Ready?

497
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,780
准备好? 为... 什么而做好准备?
Ready? R... ready for what?

498
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,690
感觉不爽吧?
That bad, huh?

499
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,910
车里有酒吗?
Is there any alcohol in this car?

500
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,940
喔 有的
Oh, yeah.

501
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,770
应有尽有
Whatever you need.

502
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,360
那么...
So, uh...

503
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,500
Hume先生 我们前往哪里?
Where to, Mr. Hume?

504
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,170
George 你就随便开开吧
Just drive, George.

505
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,000
- Hume先生  - 什么事?
- Mr. Hume.  - Yes?

506
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,790
我的名字叫Daniel Widmore
My name is Daniel. Daniel Widmore.

507
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,490
我们谈谈吧
We need to talk.

508
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,310
听着 Widmore先生 这个...
Look, uh, Mr. Widmore, um...

509
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,160
Dan 直接叫我Dan就好了
Dan. Please, call me Dan.

510
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,970
"Widmore先生"是我父亲
"Mr. Widmore" is my father.

511
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,380
Dan 是这样的 如果... 如果是关于Charlie Pace
Dan, um, look, if... if this is about Charlie Pace

512
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,910
无法和你同台演出这件事
not being able to perform with you,

513
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,640
我... 我表示遗憾
I'm... I'm very sorry.

514
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,270
Hume先生 你相信一见钟情吗?
Do you believe in love at first sight, Mr. Hume?

515
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,990
你说什么?
Excuse me?

516
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,360
几周前 我路过这家博物馆的时候
The first time I saw her, I was walking through this museum

517
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,140
第一次见到了她
a few weeks ago.

518
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,430
她... 她就在这里工作 那时她正好午餐休息
She... she works here. She was on her lunch break.

519
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,780
她正在吃一个巧克力棒
She was eating a chocolate bar.

520
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,480
她拥有蓝宝石般的眼睛 红色的头发
She has these incredible blue, blue eyes, red hair.

521
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,600
就在我看到她的时候
And as soon as I saw her,

522
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,110
就在... 在那个瞬间 就像...
right... right in that moment, it was like...

523
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,820
仿佛我已经爱上了她
it was like I already loved her.

524
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,900
事情也从那刻起 变得诡异了起来
And that's when things got weird.

525
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,920
在我见到那个女人的当晚...
That same night after I saw that woman...

526
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,300
我忽然醒来 并且写了这些
I woke up and I wrote this.

527
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,350
这是什么呢?
So what is it?

528
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,400
我也不知道 我仅仅是个搞音乐的
I'm a musician. I have no idea.

529
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,700
然后我把这个 给一个加州理工学院的朋友看
So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech.

530
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,610
他精通数学 他说这个是量子力学
He's a math whiz. He said this is quantum mechanics.

531
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,730
他说这些方程式非常超前
He said these equations are so advanced that

532
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,930
只有那些研究了一辈子物理的人
only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life

533
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,760
才可以想出来
could've come up with them.

534
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,480
所以...
So...

535
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,340
所以 那意味着什么?
so what do they mean?

536
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,360
好吧 想象一下... 假如一桩恐怖事件
Okay, imagine... imagine something terrible is about to happen,

537
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,710
一件惨事即将发生
something catastrophic.

538
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,080
唯一可以阻止这件事情发生
And the only way to stop it from happening

539
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,540
的办法是...
was by...

540
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,440
释放一股巨大的能量
releasing a huge amount of energy.

541
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,800
就比如引爆原子弹
Like setting off a nuclear bomb.

542
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,170
你想要去引爆原子弹?
You wanna set off a nuclear bomb?

543
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:24,150
听着 如果这些... 所有这些...
Just listen. What if this... all this...

544
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,270
假如所有的这些 都不应该是我们的宿命呢?
what if this wasn't supposed to be our life?

545
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,300
假如... 我们本可以有别的生活
What if we... we had some other life

546
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,140
可是出于某些原因 生活的轨迹被更改了?
and for some reason, we changed things?

547
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,430
Hume先生 我不想去引爆原子弹
I don't want to set off a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume.

548
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,900
可是 我想我已经这么做了
I think I already did.

549
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,350
听着 伙计...
Listen, mate, um...

550
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,460
我不知道这些事情与我有什么关系 所以...
I don't know what any of this has to do with me. So...

551
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,300
你为什么要问我妈妈 那个叫Penny的女孩子?
Why did you ask my mother about a woman named Penny?

552
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,220
你有过一见钟情 对不?
It happened to you, too, didn't it?

553
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,490
你有这种感觉
You felt it.

554
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,470
我不知道...
I don't know...

555
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,560
我自己也不清楚我的感受
I don't know what I felt.

556
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,430
是的 你感觉到了
Yes, you do.

557
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,380
你感受到了爱
You felt love.

558
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,010
那是不可能的
That's impossible because

559
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,860
因为我对这个女人一无所知
I don't know anything about this woman.

560
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,880
我不知道... 我不知道她身在何方
I don't know... I don't know where she is.

561
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,350
我甚至不知道 她是否活在这世上
I don't even know if she exists.

562
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,560
她是...
She's...

563
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,380
她只是我凭空想出来的
She's an idea.

564
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,700
你错了 Hume先生
No, Mr. Hume.

565
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,290
她是我的同父异母的姐妹
She's my half-sister.

566
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,970
我可以很清楚地告诉你 你可以在何时何地找到她
And I can tell you exactly where and when you can find her.

567
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,220
打扰一下?
Excuse me?

568
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,970
什么事?
Yeah?

569
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,660
你是Penny?
Are you Penny?

570
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,310
呃 是的
Uh, yes.

571
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,130
你好
Hello.

572
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,380
我叫Desmond
I'm Desmond.

573
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,480
呃 你好
Uh, hi.

574
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,360
赶紧检查下
Checking in now.

575
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,500
他没事
He's okay.

576
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,170
确实 他没事
Indeed he is.

577
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,790
Desmond 你好吗? 你感觉如何?
How are you, Desmond? How are you feeling?

578
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,310
挺好的
Fine.

579
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,310
我... 我昏迷了多久?
H... how long was I unconscious for?

580
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,400
不过几秒钟而已
Oh, no more than a few seconds.

581
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,950
你可以把我拉起来吗?
Will you help me up, please?

582
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,070
Desmond 很抱歉我们对你做的这一切
I'm really sorry we had to do this to you, Desmond.

583
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,840
但是正如我所说的 你的... 天赋是我们任务成败的关键
But as I told you, your... talent is vital to our mission.

584
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,440
所以如果你需要我给你解释...
So if you just let me explain...

585
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,200
没关系 我可以理解
It's all right. I understand.

586
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,830
什么?
What?

587
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,310
我说我可以理解的
I said I understand.

588
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,830
你告诉过我 说你把我带到岛上
You told me you brought me here to the island

589
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,740
去完成一些非常重要的事情
to do something very important.

590
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,330
是的
Yeah.

591
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,410
我们什么时候开工?
When do we start?

592
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,690
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

593
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,270
什么意思?
What do you mean?

594
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,800
我是说 20分钟以前
What I mean is 20 minutes ago,

595
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,890
你用输液架冲着Widmore一通乱打
you were beating the crap out of Widmore with an I.V. Stand,

596
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,180
然而... 然而现在 你却对他言听计从
and... and now you're Mr. Cooperative.

597
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,390
士别三日 当刮目相看嘛
A lot can happen in 20 minutes.

598
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,550
确实是
Sure it can.

599
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,790
肯定是你的脑袋被烧坏了
That thing fried your brain.

600
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,590
是吗?
Did it?

601
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,960
无论如何 你终究还是会...
Whatever. Doesn't change that you're gonna...

602
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,820
快滚
Run.

603
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,040
Desmond 我没有时间给你解释
Desmond, I don't have time to explain,

604
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,750
但是这些人都是非常危险的
but these people are extremely dangerous.

605
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,550
我们现在必须赶紧走了
We need to go now.

606
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,350
嗯 当然
Aye, of course.

607
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,420
你带路吧
Lead the way.

608
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,280
喂? 你还好吗?
Hello? You okay?

609
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,340
发生什么事了?
What happed?

610
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,790
喔 我握了下你的手 然后你就晕过去了
Well, I shook your hand, and then you fainted.

611
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,950
我肯定把你迷晕了
I must have quite an effect on you.

612
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,200
是的
Aye.

613
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,170
是的 你真迷人
Aye, you must have.

614
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,090
我们以前见过吗?
Have we met before?

615
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,960
我... 我觉得如果我们俩见过面 肯定会记得的
I... I think we'd remember it if we have

616
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,660
对的
Yeah.

617
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,530
好吧 只要你确定你现在没事了...
Well, as long as you're sure you're all right...

618
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,290
是的 我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

619
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,330
嘿 听着 呃...
Hey, listen. Um...

620
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,960
你愿意跟我去喝杯咖啡吗?
Would you like to go for a coffee?

621
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,170
什么 现在?
What, now?

622
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,020
我一身臭汗的
I'm a sweaty mess.

623
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,560
我刚刚都晕倒在你的面前了
I just fainted in front of you.

624
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,350
就当我们扯平了
I'd say we're even.

625
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,570
在Sweetzer和Melrose的交叉口
There's a coffee shop

626
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,280
有家咖啡店
on the corner of Sweetzer and Melrose.

627
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,030
我们一个小时后在那里见
I'll meet you there in an hour.

628
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,680

629
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,820
- 好的  - 一会见

630
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,100
所以... 你有找到你想找的东西吗?
So... did you find what you were looking for?

631
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,790

634
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,430
Hume先生 如果您还有什么需要我帮忙的
And if there's anything else I can do for you, Mr. Hume,

635
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,400
尽管开口就好了
you just name it.

636
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,900
George 其实 还真有个事要你帮忙
Actually, there is one thing, George.

637
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,880
你可以帮我弄到 我从悉尼来的那趟航班的 乘客名单吗?
Can you get me the manifest from my flight from Sydney?

638
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,940
大洋航空 815航班
Oceanic 815.

639
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,090
只要乘客的姓名就好了
Just the names of the passengers.

640
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,880
没问题 我可以弄到
Sure, I can.

641
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,380
您介意我问问 您要那个名单做什么吗?
Do you mind if I ask you what you need it for?

642
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,630
我仅仅是想给他们看点东西

I just need to show them something.
