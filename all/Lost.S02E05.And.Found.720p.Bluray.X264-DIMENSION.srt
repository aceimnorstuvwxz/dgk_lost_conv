00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:05,050
剧情回顾...
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:20,082
-你们是谁?   -我们坠机了
-Who are you?  -We crashed here.

3
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:22,051
815航班?
Flight 815?

4
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:25,085
你在后舱?
You were in the back?

5
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:27,097
退后
Back up!

6
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:31,000
来人
Coming out!

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,030
没事了
Everything is cool,

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,095
我们谈过了  他们相信我们也是飞机上的
we had a talk and they believe we were on the plane, too.

9
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:37,067
我想我们能一起去告大洋航空公司了
Guess we can all sue Oceanic together.

10
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:39,065
你们有几个幸存者?
How many of you survived?

11
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:43,063
23个
Twenty-three of us.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,025
记得你说过你们有23个人幸存
I thought you said there were 23 of you?

13
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:56,055
以前是的
There were.

14
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:21,081
已经过了四天了
It's been four days.

15
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:23,081
这并不像你想象的那么长
You know, that's not that long.

16
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:26,052
他们说过可能需要两周的时间来找到洋流
It could take two weeks to find a current.

17
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,056
我是说Michael知道应该怎么做
I mean, Michael knew what he was doing.

18
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,092
我想事情会...
I doubt anyhting...

19
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:36,083
怎么了?  怎么了?
What? What?

20
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,011
Sun  怎么了?
Sun, what's wrong?

21
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:45,050
我的结婚戒指不见了
My wedding ring. It's gone.

22
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:06,086
你不会打算穿这件吧?

23
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:10,041
怎么了?

24
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:16,017
我喜欢这双鞋

25
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:17,081
我也很喜欢...

26
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:20,066
但是你要穿这样的

27
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:24,087
他可能比你矮...

28
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:29,075
这太荒唐了  妈妈

29
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,098
如果你在大学里就能找个丈夫

30
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:34,087
我们现在就不需要媒人了

31
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,092
我进大学是为了拿学位的

32
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:43,053
大学四年之后  你的魅力随着你的年龄下降了

33
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:46,085
你难道就不想在魅力丧失前

34
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:49,031
找一个丈夫么?

35
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:52,035
我会在时机成熟的时候找一个丈夫的

36
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:58,037
你爸爸说现在时机已经到了

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,098
我告诉你  伙计

38
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,071
今年

39
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:06,007
爱情会降临到你的头上

40
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:09,077
既然算命的书都这么说了  那一定是真的了

41
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:12,093
我奶奶就是靠这本书找到我爷爷的

42
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:17,027
它一向很准

43
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:18,094
是怎样一个女人?

44
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:22,058
我是说她长得怎样? 这样当我们见面时我就可以认出她了

45
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,010
橙子

46
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,022
橙子

47
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:33,029
是啊  爱情就会像是橙子一样

48
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,061
我照顾不了一个女人

49
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:37,083
我甚至连自己也管不好

50
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:42,014
你能让女人来照顾你

51
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,062
那不是一个男人会做的事

52
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:49,009
男人需要一个生命的目标

53
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:52,076
他要比任何人都努力工作 然后得到晋升

54
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:57,049
他就不会像渔民的孩子那样让别人看不起

55
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:04,023
这只是一个面试  Jin

56
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:08,010
一个很重要的面试

57
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,082
我看起来怎样?

58
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:14,024
很棒  是么?

59
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:15,097
是的  很棒

60
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:19,010
你忘了把标签剪下来了

61
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,006
你在开玩笑吧?

62
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:23,039
如果我把标签剪下来了 这要我怎么还掉啊?

63
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,054
这条领带可值钱了

64
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,088
那么  Jin

65
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:33,006
如果你的爱情找上门来了我该怎么做?

66
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:40,040
就叫它等一等

67
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:57,089
伙计
man.

68
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:01,075
没事吧?   在想Sun?
It's OK?  Sun?

69
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:03,059
你会再和她团聚的
You'll be with her again.

70
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:06,043
快了
Soon.

71
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:10,042
知道了吗?
OK?

72
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:18,030
我想他们正在考虑怎么处置我们
I think they're trying to figure out what to do with us.

73
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:24,021
我想他们准备吃了我们
I think they're gonna eat us.

74
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:26,075
好了 你们全起来
All right, all of you, get up.

75
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:30,074
我们准备出发了
We're moving out.

76
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:32,073
出发去哪儿?
Moving out where?

77
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:35,094
你们得帮我们找水和食物
You're gonna help us get food and water.

78
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,066
什么  我们现在成你们手下了?
What, we work for you now?

79
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:41,023
你们得照做  因为我们还有很长一段路要走
You're gonna do it because we have a long walk ahead of us.

80
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:43,076
这么远去哪儿?
A long walk where?

81
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:48,000
回到你来的地方去
Back to where you came from.

没有情况
All clear.

85
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:32,088
-Mike  我想我们得找机会逃走  -是么?
-Mike, I thinkwe ought to stage a prison break here.  -Yeah?

86
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:35,005
在我弄明白这到底发生了什么之前
I want to figure out what the hell's going on here

87
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,047
我是不会做任何决定的
before I make decisions about anything.

88
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:40,061
好了  大家听一下
OK, people, listen up.

89
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:43,074
我们得收集尽可能多的食物和水
We need to gather as much food and water as we can.

90
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,025
两人一组行动
We travel in pairs.

91
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:48,081
你们得尽可能跑快一点  别发出任何声音
You move as fast as you can. Don't make any noise.

92
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,093
也许你能花几分钟时间来向我们解释一下
Maybe you could just take a minute to explain to us

93
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:56,006
到底发生了什么事情让你们如此紧张?
what the hell is going on over here that's got you all so on edge?

94
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:58,020
你知道么?  这倒是个好主意
Know what? That's a great idea.

95
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,011
也许我们能在路上互相讲故事
We can swap stories on the road.

96
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:04,085
在出发前我们先去探探路
I'm going to go scout before we move.

97
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:07,075
Cindy  和他一起去
Cindy, go with him.

98
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,087
Libby  去看看你能找到哪些水果
Libby, see what fruit you can gather.

99
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,052
把他带上
Take him with you.

100
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:15,023
他叫Michael
His name is Michael.

101
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:18,006
是的  好  Michael
Yeah. Right. Michael.

102
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:20,068
-等等  -我没事的  伙计  别担心
-Wait  -I'll be OK, man, don't worry.

103
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,051
Bernard和我去抓鱼
Bernard and I will gather the fish.

104
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:25,038
鱼
Fish.

105
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,099
他知道怎么抓鱼
The man knows how to fish.

106
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,012
如果我是你我就带上他
I'd take him with you if I were you.

107
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:34,046
好  他也和我们一起去
Fine. He comes with us too.

108
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:57,092
Sun

109
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,074
你没事吧?
You OK?

110
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:04,060
我的结婚戒指不见了
I lost my wedding ring.

111
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:12,005
你最后一次看到是什么时候?
When was the last time you saw it?

112
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,083
我戴习惯了  我不...
I'm so used to it, I don't...

113
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:19,066
我不知道
I don't know.

114
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,049
我有一次也丢了结婚戒指
I lost my wedding ring once.

115
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:28,087
当你很想找到某样东西的时候你会很疯狂
It's crazy where you'll look when you want to find something bad enough.

116
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:32,008
翻遍屋子外的垃圾桶
I went through the...the garbage outside the house

117
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:34,079
翻空垃圾袋和其它垃圾
emptied the bags and everything.

118
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,045
我甚至把浴室里的水管也锯开了
I even took apart the pipes in my bathroom

119
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:41,082
因为我确信它掉在了排水沟里
because I was convinced that it had gone down the drain in the sink.

120
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:43,098
你妻子怎么说?
What did your wife say?

121
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:47,004
-她不会知道的  -为什么?
-She never knew.  -How is that?

122
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:54,068
我去宝石商那里要了一个复制品  就是这样
I went to a jeweller and I had a replica made, that's how.

123
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:06,003
现在它正呆在我家空空荡荡的袜子柜里
Yeah, now it's just rattling around in my sock drawer back home.

124
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,034
我能帮你找
I can help you look.

125
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:11,078
不  谢谢
No. Thanks.

126
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:16,087
我肯定它会出现的
 I'm sure it will turn up.

127
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:40,002
你想过来帮帮我们么?
You wanna help us out over here?

128
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:42,093
你想吃东西么?
You wanna eat?

129
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:45,087
来帮帮我们
Help us.

130
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:50,099
(韩语)

131
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:57,093
我看起来会说韩语么?
Does it look like I speak Korean?

132
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,097
鱼
Fish.

133
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,066
你在阿珊娜酒店工作过

134
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:30,000
是的  先生

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,015
做餐馆工?

136
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:34,082
我升为服务员了  先生

137
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:39,042
但他们不在内部提拔

138
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,070
是的  先生  不多见

139
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,003
我相信我是少数的几个例外

140
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:48,029
你是哪个乡的?

141
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,055
什么?

142
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:55,025
你明显不是城里人

143
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:59,004
你是哪个乡的?

144
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:03,048
纳曼尼  在南海岸

145
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:05,023
怪不得...

146
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:09,054
我想我闻到你身上的鱼腥味了

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,065
这东西露出来了

148
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:19,042
谢谢  先生

149
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:27,008
Kwon先生被录用了

150
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:32,056
你马上可以开始工作了

151
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:35,076
不论晴雨你都得工作

152
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:40,045
别想要加薪或是休假

153
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:48,006
还有  Kwon先生

154
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,094
汉城之门

155
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:55,015
是全国最好的酒店

156
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,034
如果有像你一样的人进来

157
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:01,098
就别开门

158
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:06,027
好的  先生  我懂了

159
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:11,036
我会尽力工作的  谢谢

160
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:14,036
-对不起  Micheal  -什么对不起?
-Sorry, Michael.  -Sorry about what?

161
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:18,097
关于...把你和你的朋友扔进坑里的事
You know, about...throwing you and your friends into the pit.

162
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:21,072
-朋友...  -怎么了?
-Friends...  -What?

163
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:23,080
只是不认为他们是朋友
I never thought about them like that.

164
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,066
我是说  其中一个是我的朋友
One is my friend.

165
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:29,058
-我想不是那个乡巴佬  -恩  不是他
-I'm guessing not the redneck.  -Yeah. Not the redneck.

166
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:33,056
我今生从没见过这么让人害怕的人
I don't think I've ever seen someone so scared in my life.

167
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,087
现在我知道什么叫害怕了
And I know about scared.

168
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,022
这就是为什么你们把我们扔进坑里?
That why you threw us in the pit?

169
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:40,039
因为你们害怕?
Because you're scared?

170
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,028
至少我们已经...
And we've got...

171
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:46,051
相互信任了
trust issues.

172
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:48,099
是这样么?
How about that?

173
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:51,023
到底哪儿有水果?
Where the hell are all the fruits?

174
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,060
这些树上的都已经被我们摘光了
We've picked these trees clean.

175
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,041
有时你倒能在地上找到几个
Sometimes you find them on the ground.

176
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,063
那么为什么你们不去内陆看看?
Why don't you head inland?

177
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:59,039
水果全在我们那边了
That's where all the fruit is on our side.

178
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,067
-我们不去那里  -为什么?
-We don't go that way.  -Why?

179
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:10,028
因为他们就是从那里来的
Because that's where they come from.

180
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:23,059
在路上防身用的
For your protection when we travel.

181
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:32,048
是你做的?
You made this?

182
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:40,000
你叫什么名字?
So what's your name, anyway?

183
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:44,025
Mr Eko.

184
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:48,017
Eko先生?
Mr Eko?

185
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:50,050
是的
Yes.

186
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,095
怎么会这样  就像是ED先生
So, what's that like Mister Ed?

187
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,058
-Michael走了  -什么?
-Michael left.  -What?

188
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:59,019
他说了些什么后就冲进了丛林
He just said something and he went into the jungle.

189
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,005
他走了
He's gone.

190
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,013
快点  我们马上离开
Let's go. We're leaving now.

191
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:05,029
你说我们离开是什么意思?
What do you mean?

192
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,000
你的伙伴跑进丛林里去了
Your buddy ran off into the jungle.

193
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,080
Michael...他走了
Michael... left.

194
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:16,027
他想说什么?
What's he saying?

195
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:19,063
Walt!

196
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:21,040
Walt!

197
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,065
等等  有只收音机
Wait, you have a radio?

198
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:33,051
能用么?
Does it work?

199
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:37,033
你会用么? 多好的一个主意啊
Can you use it? What a great idea.

200
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:41,031
-你要拖我们后腿?  -不  Michael
-You gonna slow us down?  -No! Michael.

201
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:45,099
在他告诉他们我们在哪儿之前我们得离开
We're leaving before he can tell them where we are.

202
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:48,021
Michael

203
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,083
我们能怎么做  等他?
What are we supposed to do? Wait for him?

204
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,027
没找到他孩子他是不会回来的
He ain't comin' back without his kid.

205
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:57,084
Walt  在找到Walt前他是不会回来的
Walt! He ain't comin' back without Walt.

206
00:14:57,084 --> 00:15:02,073
你真的以为他能找到?
You really think he's gonna find him?

207
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:07,000
也许你还没注意到  人人都在为自己着想
In case you haven't noticed, it's every man for himself, Chewie.

208
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,072
Mike只担心他自己
Mike's gotta worry about Mike

209
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:12,094
我也只需要管好自己
and I gotta worry about me.

210
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:15,024
等等
Wait.

211
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:18,093
拜托
Please.

212
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:44,040
你走错路了
You're going the wrong way.

213
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,005
他是往那边去的
That's where he is going.

214
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:50,079
向着他们
Toward them.

215
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,047
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

216
00:15:56,047 --> 00:16:01,039
我要跟他一起去找他的朋友
I am going to help him find his friend.

217
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,002
我们不能在这儿等你
We can't wait for you.

218
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:10,012
我没期望你们等我
I don't expect you to.

219
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:20,030
你得一步一步回忆
All you gotta do is retrace your steps.

220
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,096
就像...你昨天做了什么?
Like, what did you do yesterday?

221
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:25,021
我醒来  洗漱

Walked with Shannon.

223

我们摘了些水果...
We picked some fruit,

224
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,065
喂了Vincent  然后...
cut it up to feed Vincent. Then I was...

225
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:35,061
你喂过狗了?
Whoa. You fed the dog?

226
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:39,007
这就是了
Bingo.

227
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:42,083
那么...汉城
So...Seoul.

228
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:46,092
是在韩国还是朝鲜?
Is that in the good Korea or the bad Korea?

229
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:51,037
在韩国
The good one.

230
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:57,055
你去看奥运会了么?
Did you go to the Olympics?

231
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:00,053
Hurley  这太荒唐了
Hurley, this is ridiculous.

232
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:04,077
在这儿等...
Waiting here for...

233
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:07,002
这狗没吃我的戒指
The dog did not eat my ring.

234
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:09,096
伙计  狗什么都吃
Dude, dogs will eat anything.

235
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:12,054
当我还是个孩子  我有只狗Buster
When I was a kid, my dog Buster...

236
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:15,051
我会把零钱都存在一个抽屉里
I had this drawer where I'd throw in all my change.

237
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,049
当不见了之后我以为有人偷了
I guess there were Smarties in there.

238
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:24,066
然而一天后  Buster拉出了1元35分
So the next day, Buster craps out a buck thirty-five in nickels.

239
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:33,004
你养过狗么?
Did you ever own a dog?

240
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:34,058
是的
Yes.

241
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:36,084
Jin给过我一只
Jin gave me one.

242
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:38,059
一只小狗
A puppy.

243
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,091
它叫什么
What was his name?

00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,051
Bpo

245
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:44,081
Bpo

246
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:50,085
-有什么意义么?  -嗯  意思是"一个吻"
-That mean something?  -Yes. It means "a kiss".

247

一个吻
A kiss.

248
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:00,096
把手保持在膝盖上  好么?

249
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:07,047
除非别人直接和你讲话  否则别开口

250
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:08,086
她真漂亮啊

251
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,063
你会爱上他的

252
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:13,043
他很英俊...受过良好的教育...

253
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:19,016
这家酒店和其它12家酒店都是他家开的

254
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:25,026
下午好  欢迎来到汉城之门

255
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:29,013
你的酒店真是漂亮

256
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:32,031
哦  你太客气了

257
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:36,029
我知道你女儿上过汉城国立大学

258
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:41,039
当然比不过哈佛了

259
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,052
好吧

260
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:50,002
让我们留点时间给他们两个认识一下吧

261
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,029
那么谁给你的压力较大?

262
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,090
你妈妈还是你爸爸?

263
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,092
当然是我爸爸了...通过我的妈妈

264
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:14,017
你呢?

265
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:18,004
我的爸爸  通过我的妈妈

266
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:22,013
姑妈  还有奶奶

267
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,077
你是学什么的?

艺术历史

269
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,008
老实说我对艺术一点也不了解

270
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:33,023
你学什么?

273
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:44,045
是啊  不知不觉

274
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:51,051
我通常都很不喜欢这样的会面

275
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:54,044
但是今天...却不同

276
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:59,042
对我来说也一样

277
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,023

00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:52,023
不介意我坐下吧?
You mind if I sit?

300
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:59,047
你看到了?
Did you see me?

301
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:04,097
糟蹋你的菜园?  没有
Rip apart your garden? No.

302

303
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:17,056
我想我没看过你发火
I don't think I have ever seen you angry.

304
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:21,029
我以前经常发火
Oh, I used to get angry.

305
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,028
总是
All the time.

306
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,069
也很失落
Frustrated, too.

307
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:31,025
那么你现在不失落了?
So you are not frustrated anymore?

308
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:35,090
我不再失落了
I'm not lost any more.

309
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,023
你怎么做到的?
How did you do that?

310
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:44,067
就像塞翁失马焉知非福...
Same way anything lost gets found.

311
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:49,049
我不再期望什么了
I stopped looking.

312
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:26,031
下午好  Lee先生

313
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,017
不介意我借用一下它吧?

314
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,092
我有个约会

315
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:38,058
当然  先生

316
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:41,091
谢谢

317
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:45,043
你叫..

318
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,095
Jin Soo Kwon  先生

319
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:52,012
谢谢  Kwon先生

320
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,078
然后那张卡滑到了门外面...

321
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:04,078
而我在走廊上  身上只有一条毛巾

322
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:07,043
我想那是电影里经常有的情节

323
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:11,082
我得和服务员说这家酒店是我开的

324
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:13,022
但她不相信我

325
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:17,033
真是尴尬

326
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:24,054
我不敢相信你是这么的...平易近人

327
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:28,066
我认为你也很出色  Sun

328
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,047
那么...

329
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,024
我很想让我们继续保持联系

330
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:37,071
我们的父母肯定都会很高兴的

331
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:41,080
不再有媒人  不再有压力

332
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,018
我们能轻松了

333
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:50,034
让我告诉你个秘密吧

334
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:53,084
好的

335
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:57,049
我在哈佛的时候认识了一个美国女人

336
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,097
我还没告诉过我的爸爸  但是...

337
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:06,030
六个月后  我就要搬去那儿和她结婚了

338
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:12,024
等等...你不认为...

339
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:15,025
当然很好

340
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:17,025
美国

341
00:27:17,025 --> 00:27:19,049
真是好地方

342
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:20,051
我认为你...

343
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:22,093
我很为你高兴

344
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:24,074
下午好  先生

345
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:27,019
你还需要点什么么?

346
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,069
不  不用了  谢谢

347
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:31,097
要点咖啡或是点心么?

348
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:33,093
不了  谢谢

349
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:37,027
事实上  我还有个约会

350
00:27:37,027 --> 00:27:38,019
Sun...

351
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:44,013
非常感谢你的午餐

352
00:27:58,013 --> 00:28:03,009
不  不是那边  是这边
No, not that way. Over here.

353
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,070
是脚后跟
Around here

354
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,089
还很新
This is fresh.

355
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:15,007
这些痕迹
His tracks.

356
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:18,007
Michael?

357
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:22,008
是的  Michael
Yes, Michael.

358
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:26,087
他们是不会留下痕迹的
They don't leave tracks.

359
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:26,017
-Michael...   -不
-Michael...   -No.

360
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:30,061
他们没有抓他
They don't have him.

361
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:39,075
他们是从那儿来的
They came from that way.

362
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:43,054
你的朋友往那儿去了
Your friend went that way.

363
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:45,093
刚好避开他们
Crossed ahead of them.

364
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:50,045
很幸运
Very lucky.

365
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:55,013
你...回去  我去
You... go back. I go.

366
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:57,052
不
No.

367
00:30:57,052 --> 00:31:02,088
我们一起去
We go together.

368
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:14,004
不好意思  不好意思

369
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:20,040
能让我的小孩用一下洗手间么?

370
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,091
拜托  先生  他尿急

371
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:26,068
对不起先生  只对酒店客人开放

372
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:30,055
街的那一头有厕所

373
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,001
能忍住么?

374
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:38,020
抱歉  他真的很急

375
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,057
好的

376
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:43,099
进去吧  在左边

377
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:45,029
但是拜托...快一点

378
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,009
谢谢...你真是个好人

379
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:51,098
快...快去

380
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:55,047
Kwon先生

381
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:59,041
我是怎么和你说的  有些人不能进去

382
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,098
我很抱歉  先生

383
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:04,061
这是对你的第一次警告

384
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:05,093
那只是一个小孩

385
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:08,007
他能在排水沟里随便撒尿

386
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:11,025
你们这些人都是这样的

387
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:13,086
如果你想保住工作...

388
00:32:13,086 --> 00:32:19,077
找到他们赶他们出去

389
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,041
你做什么?

390
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:33,076
谢谢你给的机会  先生

391
00:32:51,014 --> 00:32:54,081
你好
Hello.

392
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:59,001
风景真好
It's pretty.

393
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:09,042
Hurley告诉我你的结婚戒指不见了
Hurley told me that you lost your wedding ring.

394
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:12,027
我坐在这里
I was just sitting here

395
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:17,044
告诉自己为这个事心烦真是愚蠢
telling myself it's silly to be so upset about it.

396
00:33:17,044 --> 00:33:22,069
它只是一样东西
It is just a thing.

397
00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:31,080
他们才刚走了几天  你知道...
They've only been gone a few days, you know...

398
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,092
别说了
Don't.

399
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:38,037
我厌烦了每个人都和我说他没事
I am sick of everyone saying he is all right.

400
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:42,081
他肯定出事了
He is not all right!

401
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:46,030
Claire找到了一个漂流瓶
Claire found the bottle.

402
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,068
里面有我们写的信息
The one with the messages inside.

403
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:54,072
是竹筏上的
The one from the raft.

404
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:02,005
瓶子在哪儿?
Where is it?

405
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:07,032
我埋了
I buried it.

406
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:34,002
停下
Stop.

407
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:37,097
把水给我
Can I see your water?

408
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:42,017
你再拖我们后腿我们就不管你了
Keep slowing us down, we'll leave you behind.

409
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:44,047
走吧  别管我了
Go ahead. Leaving me behind.

410
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:48,061
好的  再见
All right, see ya.

411
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:51,046
我有个问题
Got a question for you.

412
00:34:51,046 --> 00:34:54,061
什么?
Yeah?

413
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:56,092
既然你的向导走了
Now that your tracker's gone

414
00:34:56,092 --> 00:35:00,099
你没了我怎么还能找到我们的营地?
how are you gonna find our camp without me?

415
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:04,093
横穿过这个岛  沿着海滩走
Walk across the island, follow the beaches.

416
00:35:04,093 --> 00:35:08,095
并且Eko会回来的
And Eko's coming back.

417
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:10,096
你结婚了么?
You married?

418
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:13,006
什么?
What?

419
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:15,076
你结婚了吗?
Are you married?

420
00:35:15,076 --> 00:35:17,097
没有
No.

421
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:19,013
太糟了
Too bad

422
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:22,095
你看起来像结过婚了
you seem suited for it.

423
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:25,015
真有趣
Funny.

424
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:26,067
你呢?
What about you?

425
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:28,042
没有  小姐
No, ma'am.

426
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,010
你是同性恋?
You gay?

427
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,012
真有趣
Funny.

428
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:36,082
我们走吧
Let's go.

429
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:41,048
我们还等什么?
What are we waiting for?

430
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:06,026
在这儿等着
Wait here.

431
00:36:06,026 --> 00:36:08,001
我们跟丢了
We lost his trail.

432
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:12,090
我再回去找一找
I go back and find it.

433
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:27,004
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

434
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:29,044
-回去    -Michael
-Go back.    -Michael!

435
00:36:29,044 --> 00:36:34,023
回去  伙计
Go back, man!

436
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:45,039
Walt  Walt

437
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,055
Walt

438
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:49,092
-Michael    -走开
-Michael!  -Look, go away!

439
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:51,010
没找到他我是不会回去的
I'm not going back without him!

440
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:54,051
Walt  我在这儿
Walt! I'm here!

441
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:56,085
你在哪儿?
Where are you, man?

442
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:58,048
Walt

443
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,048
怎么了  你担心他们听到我?
You worried they're gonna hear me?

444
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:02,074
让他们把我带走
Let them take me!

445
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:05,082
来吧  来把我带走
Come! Come take me!

446
00:37:05,082 --> 00:37:08,079
这么喊是没用的
Shouting is not a good idea.

447
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,058
你得和我们一起回去
You need to come back with us now.

448
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:12,097
我不会丢下我孩子不管的
I'm not leaving him out here!

449
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:17,029
离我远点
Stay away from me!

450
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:22,082
我知道他们带走了你孩子...
I know they took your son...

451
00:37:22,082 --> 00:37:27,077
但是你不知道这些人有多少能耐
but you have no idea what these people are capable of.

452
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:32,044
而且如果他们不愿意的话你是找不到他们的
They will not be found if they don't want to be.

453
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:36,002
他们从我身边活活把孩子抢走了
They took him... right out of my hands.

454
00:37:36,002 --> 00:37:41,039
就从我身边
Right out of my hands!

455
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,049
没找到他我是不会回去的
I'm not going back without him.

456
00:37:55,006 --> 00:38:01,090
你会找到Walt的   Michael
You find Walt, Michael.

457
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:37,036
我能看看吗?
Can I see it?

458
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:52,046
Kate  那些是私人信息
Kate, those are private.

459
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:54,081
Kate  别看了
