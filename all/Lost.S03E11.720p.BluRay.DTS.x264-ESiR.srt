1
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:04,063
前情提要...
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:07,042
你可以回去了
You can go back to your camp.

3
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:08,071
那我的朋友呢?
What about my friends?

4
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:11,025
你要做的是回去告诉你们的人
Your job is to tell the rest of your people

5
00:00:11,026 --> 00:00:13,038
永远不要来找我们
they can never come here.

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,006
安息吧 Eko先生
Rest in peace, Mr.Eko.

7
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:21,012
谢谢你帮我找到...
And thank you for helping me find my...

8
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:25,090
抬起你的头向北看 John

9
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,076
我不在乎Jack怎么说
I don't care what Jack said.

10
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:29,020
我们要把他找回来
They've got him, and we have to get him back.

11
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:30,072
这是我欠他的
I owe him that.

12
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:33,084
珍珠站是一个监控站
The pearl is a monitoring station

13
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:37,068
此舱用于监视和观察
where the activities of participants in the Dharma initiative projects

14
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:43,027
达摩实验的参与者
can be observed and recorded.

15
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:51,095
他一定在等待我们
I guess he'll be expecting us.

16
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:07,020
乒乓台?
Ping-Pong table?

17
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:08,098
这东西从哪儿弄来的?
Where the hell did that come from?

18
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,080
Jin在我们找木柴的时候找到的
Jin found it when he was out looking for firewood.

19
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:14,062
我们做了桌子腿和球拍
We made legs for it and paddles.

20
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:16,032
我们需要的是球
Now all we need is a ball.

21
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,097
是找到的?
Found it?

22
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:20,097
一定是舱里爆炸后飞出来的
Must have landed in the jungle when the hatch exploded.

23
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:22,040
我以为舱里只是倒塌了
I thought the hatch collapsed.

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,041
我只知道天空变成了紫色
Look, dude, all I know is the sky turned purple.

25
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:28,082
从那以后 我就不再问问题了 我要开始新的生活
After that, I don't ask questions, just make myself a salad and move on.

26
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,010
是啊 那还真管用
Yeah, I can see that's working for you.

27
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:34,002
你看见kate了吗?
You seen Kate around?

28
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:38,070
她还没回来吗?
she's not back yet?

29
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,000
有什么东西能当球打吗?
You guys find anything we can use for a ball?

30
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,078
没有
No

31
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,086
那是我的"枪支与军火"
Hey, that's my "Guns & Ammo."

32
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:47,016
怎么会在你手里?
Where the hell did you get it?

33
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:49,034
我在杂志堆里找到的
It was in the magazine stack.

34
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,072
现在我们资源共享了
We share things now.

35
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:54,081
听着Zorro 这是我的东西...
Listen, Zorro, it was in my stuff...

36
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:56,045
当你们以为我死了的时候
Stuff you decided to have a little party with

37
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,095
你们就用我的东西开派对了?
while you thought I was dead.

38
00:01:57,096 --> 00:02:04,046
听着 Hillbilly 如果你想要的话 就拿去吧
Listen, Hillbilly, if you want it that bad, take it.

39
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:09,028
自己留着吧
Just keep it.

40
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:27,082
我们得吃东西了
We need to eat.

41
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:32,077
我们的方向对吗?
Are we still on course?

42
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:39,065
我们依然朝着北方3-0-5方向前进
We're still heading north on a bearing of 3-0-5.

43
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,060
是的
Yes.

44
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,028
我感到你缺乏信心
I'm sensing a lack of confidence.

45
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,096
我们跟着那棍子上的雕刻
We've been walking for two days

46
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:47,073
已经走了两天了
following a compass bearing provided by the carvings on a stick.

47
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:48,057
那么?
And?

48
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:51,049
你真的认为 这会帮助我们找到"the others"的营地吗?
You really think we're just going to chance upon where the others are?

49
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,057
我不知道我们还会遇到什么
I don't know what we're gonna chance on

50
00:02:53,058 --> 00:03:00,021
但这是我们唯一的方向
but my bearing is the only bearing we got.

51
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,052
我要去找些水果 然后
I'm going to find some fruit,and then,

52
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:10,038
John 我们要好好谈谈下一步的行动了
John, we're going to have a rational conversation regarding our next move.

63
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,096
你们在找...这个吧?
You'all looking for something like... this?

64
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:51,001
酷 一个球
Cool, a ball.

65
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:53,049
我们要来个小小的交易
We need to do a little quid pro quo first.

66
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,082
我离开这里有段时间了
I know I've been gone a while

67
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,010
你们就认为可以把我的东西
and you'all thought the general store

68
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:58,057
拿到百货商场廉价出售
was having a going out of business sale

69
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:01,032
但我回来了 我想要回我的东西
but now I'm back, and I want what's mine.

70
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,000
但那些东西原本也不是你的
Yeah, but it wasn't really yours to begin with.

71
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,005
"A"-- 那些是我找到的
"A"-- It was mine when I took it.

72
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,090
"B"-- 你又是谁?
"B"-- Who the hell are you?

73
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:14,056
"C"-- 我很公平 我们用比赛决定
And "C"-- Because I'm fair, I'm gonna let you play me for it.

74
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:16,039
打乒乓球?
Play ping-Pong?

75
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,046
是啊 大块头
That's right, Avalanche.

76
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:20,025
你们这群家伙尽管挑个打得最好的
You bastards put up your best player.

77
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:23,058
就一场比赛 我赢了之后
One game, and when I crush them

78
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:27,003
你们要把我的每样东西都还给我
you'all gotta bring me every piece of my stash back.

79
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:29,055
如果你输了呢?
And if you lose?

80
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:32,099
我不会输的 但...
I ain't gonna lose, but..

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,033
如果我输了...随你们怎么样
if I do, tell you what...name it.

82
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:51,039
看来"卧虎藏龙"有好的主意
Looks like Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon got something good.

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,035
说吧
Lay it on me.

84
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:56,045
不许再叫我们的绰号
No nicknames.

85
00:05:56,046 --> 00:06:00,031
如果你输了 一个星期内...
If you lose, no nicknames for anyone...

86
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:02,070
不许叫我们的绰号
for a week.

87
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:06,029
好棒
Nice.

88
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,091
成交
You're on.

89
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,013
选出你们的选手吧
Pick your player.

90
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:17,090
一小时后我会回来 然后我会宰了你们
I'll be back in an hour, then let the slaughter begin.

91
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:23,079
你确定这房子周围什么都没有？
Are you sure it's completely isolated?

92
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,062
我搜索过周边地带
I've circled the house.

93
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:28,001
附近除了丛林什么都没有
There's nothing but jungle surrounding it.

94
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:32,058
给你
Here.

95
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,027
那个雷达还能工作吗?
That dish still work?

96
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,070
这样的卫星雷达
A satellite dish of that size would have

97
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:40,004
能传播几千英里的信息
broadcasting capabilities for thousands of miles.

98
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:43,056
Danielle 你提到过雷达站
Danielle, you once mentioned a radio tower.

99
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:45,010
是这个吗?
Is this it?

100
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:48,057
我从来没有来过这里
I have never been here before.

101
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:51,002
那里面的男人...你说你见过他?
The man in the house...you said you've seen him before?

102
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,087
就是珍珠站录像里的那个人
On a video feed from the pearl station.

103
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,013
那他是谁?
So who is he?

104
00:06:55,014 --> 00:07:00,020
只有一种办法能找到答案...
Only one way to find out...

105
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,065
我们去问他
we ask him.

106
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,040
这是干嘛?
What's this for?

107
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:07,000
如果我不带武器 他就不会感到有威胁
If I'm unarmed, he won't feel threatened.

108
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:11,045
如果他有所动作 你从这里掩护我
In case he is threatened, you can cover me from here.

109
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,008
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

110
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:16,035
我对那房子里的男人没兴趣
I have no interest in that man inside the house.

111
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:23,012
我能生存下来是因为我尽量避免与他们正面接触
I have survived on the island precisely by avoiding these types of encounters.

112
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:25,067
我会在小溪边等你们...
I'll wait for you by the stream...

113
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:31,001
等能活下来的
for those of you who survive.

114
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,004
Najeev Najeev

115
00:07:55,005 --> 00:08:00,048
有个人想要见你

116
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,009
这是你做的吗?
Did you cook this?

117
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,073
是的
Yes, I did.

118
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:16,079
这很美味
It's delicious.

119
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
我叫Sami
My name is Sami.

120
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,084

请坐
Please sit.

122
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,031
你从哪里来 Najeev?
So where are you from, Najeev?

123
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:29,003
我是Syrian人
I'm Syrian.

124
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,017
拜托
Please.

125
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:37,092
你和我一样是伊拉克人吧 年轻人

126
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:42,071
你想怎么样?
What do you want from me?

127
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:46,090
你是个出色的厨师 我...
You're an excellent cook, and I...

128
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:50,070
有一个很好的餐馆
I have a restaurant much nicer than this place.

129
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,080
来看看吧
Come take a look.

130
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:58,009
如果你喜欢 我会付你双倍的工资
If you like it, I will hire you at twice your pay here.

131
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,027
就凭一顿饭你就会雇佣一个陌生人?
You're offering a stranger a job because of a single meal?

132
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:05,083
我给你工作是因为我和你都是外来者
I'm offering you a job because we are outsiders here

133
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:13,011
我的主厨刚好辞职了
and because, uh, my chef just quit.

134
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:54,004
他中弹了
He's been hit, he's been hit!

135
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:55,045
你也想被射到吗?
You wanna get shot, too?

136
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:57,006
我没有越线!
I didn't cross the line!

137
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:58,038
我们有停战协议的
We had a truce.

138
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,009
这是我的地盘!
This is my land!

139
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,084
我不是...你们说我可以待在这里的!
I'm not.. You said I could stay here!

140
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:03,058
我不是..你说的那个人
I'm not who you..Who you think I am.

141
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,082
我叫Sayid Jarrah
My name is Sayid Jarrah.

142
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:10,059
几个月前我们的飞机坠毁了
I was on a plane that crashed here months ago.

143
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,010
飞机?!
A plane?!

144
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:17,032
我发誓我没有武器!
I'm unarmed, I swear!

145
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:22,061
待在那儿别动!
Stay right there!

146
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,032
把枪扔掉!
Drop the rifle!

147
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,022
快点扔掉
Drop it right now!

148
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:35,072
退后
Back up.

149
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:40,092
退后
Back up.

150
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,082
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

151
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,071
你们的飞机真的坠毁了?
You really did crash here?

152
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:49,083
是的 我们还有40多个人
Over 40 of us, yes.

153
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:53,075
我先进去看看
I'll go in first, make sure it's okay.

154
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:55,084
你是谁?
Who are you?

155
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:59,043
我叫Mikhail Bakunin...
My name is Mikhail Bakunin...

156
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:05,087
我是达摩计划的最后一个存活成员
and I am the last living member of the Dharma Initiative.

157
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:15,001
小心脚下
Watch your step.

158
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:21,042
请坐
Please...Sit.

159
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:25,009
让我来
Here, let me.

160
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,005
你有治疗枪伤的经验?
You've had experience treating gunshot wounds?

161
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:30,094
我在阿富汗待了一段时间
I spent some time in Afghanistan.

162
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:33,054
获得了一些战地救助的经验...
I had experience with field medicine...

163
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:36,053
我在苏联的部队里
in the Soviet army.

164
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:39,080
厨房里架子上有医疗用品
In the kitchen on the top shelf there is a medical kit.

165
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:42,083
请你把它拿过来
Will you bring it, please?

166
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:48,024
没关系的 Kate
It's all right, Kate.

167
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,022
你怎么到这里来的?
How did you get here?

168
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:57,066
我不知道该从何说起
I almost don't know where to begin.

169
00:11:57,067 --> 00:12:01,005
为什么你不和我说说达摩组织呢?
Why don't you begin with the Dharma Initiative?

170
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:04,084
我在kiev长大并加入了军队
I grew up in Kiev and joined the Soviet army.

171
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:10,060
我在vladivostok一个监听站服役
I was stationed at a listening post in Vladivostok.

172
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:14,099
冷战结束后
After the cold war...

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,080
我们冷战输了以后，我们的小队被解散了
After we lost the cold war, my unit was decommissioned.

174
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,079
我离开了军队
I was dismissed from my life in the military,

175
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,078
经过了那么多年和敌人的战斗
and after years of conducting unpleasant actions against our enemies

176
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,019
我发现我想做些好事
I found myself wanting to do something good

177
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,009
后来我被一则报纸上的广告所吸引
so I replied to a newspaper advertisement.

178
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,055
一则广告?
An advertisement?

179
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:37,083
"你想拯救世界吗?" 它写到
"Would you like toave the world?" It read.

180
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:40,030
我就是这样知道这个组织的
That's how I met the Initiative.

181
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:45,084
他们很有钱也很聪明 但必须对外保密
They're very secretive, very rich and very smart.

182
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:47,095
那么你是什么时候来的?
So when did you come to the island?

183
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,055
11年前
11 years now.

184
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:53,094
我喜欢电脑 通讯设备
I liked computers, communications equipment

185
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:57,032
喜欢像灯塔守夜人一样孤独的生活
and being alone like a lighthouse keeper

186
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,055
他们就让我到这个站来了
so they put me in this station.

187
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:01,070
他们称为"火焰舱"
They called it "The Flame."

188
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,039
火焰舱的用途是什么?
What's the purpose of The Flame?

189
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,083
当然是和外界通讯
To communicate with the outside world, of course.

190
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,059
准备好了吗?
Ready to play?

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,069
准备好了吗?
Ready to play?

192
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:37,027
到你了
Your move.

193
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:41,015
达摩组织发生了什么事?
What happened to the Dharma Initiative?

194
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:43,018
他们全死了
They're all dead, of course.

195
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,085
他们愚蠢的发起了对"敌人"的战争
They foolishly initiated a war against the hostiles

196
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:50,006
他们叫作"大清洗"
a "purge," they called it.

197
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:53,074
那你是怎么幸存下来的?
And how did you survive this purge?

198
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:56,068
我没有参与其中
By not participating in it.

199
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,089
我告诉过你
I told you.

200
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,070
我喜欢独自行动
I like being alone.

201
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:03,038
那"敌人"们允许你住在这里?
And the hostiles allowed you to stay here?

202
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,039
当一切都结束后 4个人出现在我的田地里
After it was over, four men appeared in the yard.

203
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,098
并提出停战协定
They offered a truce.

204
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:13,061
他们在各个地方划出界限
They said to imagine a line that extended all the way around the valley.

205
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:19,081
如果我不越线 他们就不会管我
As long as I did not cross it, I would be left alone.

206
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:23,061
然后他们带走两头牛 我再也没看到过它们
Then they took two cows, and I never saw them again.

207
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,004
他们对那个卫星雷达不感兴趣?
They weren't interested in the satellite dish in the yard?

208
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,050
那又怎么样?
Why would they be?

209
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:30,049
那个东西几年前就没用了
It hasn't functioned for years.

210
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,078
他们是谁..这些"敌人"?
Who are they..these hostiles?

211
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,080
我不知道 但他们比我们先到这里
I do not know, but they were here for a long time before we were

212
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:43,092
早很多
A very long time.

213
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,088
我在找Sami
I'm looking for Sami.

214
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,039
Sami!

215
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,055
很高兴你能来
I'm so glad you came.

216
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:16,088
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

217
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:22,031
这是一个简洁的地方 我们有很好的客人
It's a simple place, as you can see, but we have good customers.

218
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:24,074
这是我的夫人
Here's my wife.

219
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:28,059
她主管厨房
She's in charge of the kitchen.

220
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,092
Amira 来见Najeev
Amira, come meet Najeev.

221
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:44,005
很高兴见到你
Pleasure to meet you.

222
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:46,063
你确定是他么?
Are you sure this is him?

223
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:49,008
是的
Yes.

224
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,028
你们一定搞错了...
Look, I don't know who you think I am...

225
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,069
你刚才说什么?
What did you just say?

226
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,085
我告诉Nadia礼貌点 因为你们是我的客人
I told Nadia to be polite, because you are my guests.

227
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:30,047
Nadia?

228
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:37,057
Nadia Comaneci最出色的体操运动员
After Nadia Comaneci, the greatest athlete the world has ever known.

229
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:42,092
我们的生日是同一天
We have the same birthday.

230
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,057
现在...
Now...

231
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:51,050
伤口弄好了
excellent work, if I say myself.

232
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,031
谢谢你 Mikhail
Thank you, Mikhail.

233
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:57,059
也许我可以为你们弄些冰茶
Perhaps...I can begin to earn your forgiveness by offering some iced tea.

234
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:03,006
我去看看你们的朋友
I will also check on your friend.

235
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:17,009
别浪费时间了
Don't waste your time.

236
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,038
十年来我一直想办法打败电脑
For ten years I've tried to defeat that game.

237
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,007
但这个程序是3个博士编写的...
But it was programmed by three grand masters...

238
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:25,006
而且它还作弊
and it cheats.

239
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,042
我玩过许多电脑
Well I've played a lot of computers

240
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:30,061
而且很肯定它们不懂怎么作弊
and I'm pretty sure they don't know how to cheat.

241
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:35,020
这就是为什么我们人类是这么...
That's what makes being human so distinctly...

242
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:39,080
奇妙
wonderful.

243
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:49,062
怎么了?
What's wrong?

244
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:53,028
这...根本没道理
It just...it doesn't make any sense.

245
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:57,099
他为什么让John和那么多设备器材待在一起?
Why would they let him stay here, with all this stuff, all this equipment?

246
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,016
这再合理不过了
Actually, it makes perfect sense.

247
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:01,049
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

248
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:07,062
他让我们待在这儿 因为他不是达摩的人
The reason they let him stay here is because he is not Dharma.

249
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:12,036
他是"他们"的人
He is one of them.

250
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:18,041
他射了你 你还...
He shot you, and you just let him...

251
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:20,076
我们为什么还待在这儿?
Why are we still sitting here?

252
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,003
我们要待在这里 Kate
We are sitting here, Kate

253
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:28,004
我确信不止他一个人在这儿
because I am certain he is not alone.

254
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:44,057
你真的是最棒的吗 大怪脸?
So...you really the number one draft pick, Grimace?

255
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:48,082
我们用的是"宽容规则"吗?
Are we playing with the mercy rule?

256
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,013
宽容规则?
Mercy rule?

257
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:56,084
如果我打出11比0 那我就赢了
Yeah,like,If I'm up 11-0, then I, you know, automatically win.

258
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,065
你想赢我11比0?
You're gonna go up 11-0?

259
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:02,063
不 规则适用双方选手
No, I mean either one of us.

260
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:03,083
当然
Sure.

261
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:06,063
我们可以用这个规则
We can have a mercy rule.

262
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:08,007
我能发球吗?
Do you wanna volley for serve?

263
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:11,059
随便你
I'll tell you what...Be my guest.

264
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,013
干掉他 Hurley
Take him down, Hurley.

265
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:17,029
加油 Hurley

266
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,027
0比0
0 serving 0.

267
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:33,012
1比0
1-Nothing.

268
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:41,071
我自己做的茶 如果有点苦的话请别介意
I grow the tea myself, so pardon its bitterness.

269
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:43,018
我们十分感激
Any tea is good tea.

270
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,053
我们很长时间没见过冰了
You know how long it's been since we've seen ice?

271
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:51,070
我发现站周围有许多粗电线
I noticed a series of thick wires as I walked around the station.

272
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,085
这是网络集线器
This is the hub,

273
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:56,019
和这岛上的其它站相连接
but they go underground to various stations all over the island.

274
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,078
有没有一根是通向大海的?
And these cables--do any of them run into the ocean?

275
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,069
是的 海底电缆连接的声纳
Yes. There is an underwater beacon that emits sonar pings

276
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,035
为船只导航
to help guide in the vessels.

277
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,004
导航 你是说潜水艇吗?
By vessels, you mean submarines?

278
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,078
是的
Yes.

279
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,060
并且它有自主判断能力
The Initiative used one to bring us here

280
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:12,092
但现在它不是被"敌人"销毁
but I can imagine only that the hostiles have either destroyed

281
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:15,055
就是被他们操控了
or commandeered it by now.

282
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:16,094
这就能解释他们
That explains how they were able

283
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:20,000
饶开我的位点 并夺走了我们的帆船
to get round my position and capture our sailboat.

284
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,083
你们有帆船?
You have a sailboat?

285
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:26,049
直到被"敌人"抢走
Till we lost it to your hostiles.

286
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,050
那太不幸了
That's very unfortunate.

287
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:38,009
至少我们能杀了其中的一个人
Well...at least we were able to kill one them.

288
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:47,020
我们为什么还要兜圈子呢...
Why are we continuing to play this little game...

289
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:53,051
为什么不直接切入正题?
when we all know it has moved to the next stage?

290
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:24,099
拿些绳子来
Get some rope.

291
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:49,012
喝了它
Drink.

292
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:05,091
你在共和国卫队里是个拷问官吧?
You were a torturer, were you not, in the Republican Guard?

293
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:10,064
难道你认不出你的受害者了?
Do you not recognize one of your victims?

294
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:14,020
难道你不记得被你折磨的女人了吗?
Do you not recognize the woman that you tortured?

295
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:16,032
难道你认不出我妻子了吗?!
Do you not recognize my wife?!

296
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:20,091
不 我...
No, I've never...

297
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:26,097
你一定是搞错了
You've confused me with someone else.

298
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:35,019
Amira因为窝藏敌人的罪名被捕了
Amira was arrested for harboring an enemy of the state.

299
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:43,039
在她被关押的3个月间 她被拷问无数次
She was held for three months while she was questioned.

300
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:48,033
她的手臂上满是伤疤
Her arms bear the scars of those questions.

301
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:56,020
我向你保证 Najeev 我没有弄错
So I assure you, Najeev, I am not confused.

302
00:22:57,021 --> 00:23:00,048
我的名字不是Najeev
My name is not Najeev.

303
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:03,064
我叫Sayid Jarrah
I am Sayid Jarrah.

304
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:06,030
我曾在共和国卫队
I was in the Republican Guard

305
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:09,085
而且我是个拷问官 但我从来没见过你的妻子
and, yes, I was an interrogator, but I have never seen your wife.

306
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,059
也许她在哪里见过我
Maybe she saw me at the same facility

307
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,072
但我的确不认识她!
but I do not know her!

308
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:18,081
我记得每一个我拷问的人
I can remember every face of every person I've interrogated.

309
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:24,024
她记得你的脸
She remembers your face.

310
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:28,047
她一踏进你们的饭店
She remembers it so well that she recognized it from a mere glimpse

311
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:36,090
就认出你来了!
when we walked by the restaurant where you worked!

312
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:46,061
你要我做什么?
What do you want from me?

313
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:53,059
我要你承认你所做的 否则
I want you to admit to what you did, And if you don't

314
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:59,032
你想要离开这里 只有被装进那包里了
you will leave this room in that bag.

315
00:24:07,026 --> 00:24:09,025
你怎么知道他不是一个人?
How do you know he isn't alone?

316
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:11,043
外面的那匹马还装有马鞍
The horse outside is still saddled

317
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:14,087
而且马镫的设置比这个男人的脚要短许多
And the stirrups are set up for someone much shorter than this man.

318
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:18,009
你认为"The others"派人来让他合作?
You think the others sent someone to keep him company?

319
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,093
他们派人来是因为他们失去了联系
They sent someone out here because they lost communications.

320
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:24,032
也许是因为天空变成了紫色?
Maybe when the sky turned purple?

321
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,014
这正是我所想的
That would be my guess.

322
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:28,044
如果有人在这里的话 他一定藏的很好
If there's someone else here, they're hiding pretty good.

323
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:34,095
我检查过这地方的每个角落...
I checked every nook and cranny of this place...

324
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:41,038
还不够彻底
Not every nook and cranny.

325
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:11,004
你准备好说实话了吗?
Are you ready to tell me the truth?

326
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:16,062
我已经把实话告诉你了
I have told you the truth.

327
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:20,046
我不认识你
I do not know you

328
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:24,046
你折磨过她!
You tortured her.

329
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:25,065
不
No.

330
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:31,034
我从不碰女人
I would never touch a woman

331
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,015
你认为这样做
Do you think this will do any good

332
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:40,064
会让我承认我没做过的事?
that this will make me confess to something I didn't do?

333
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:43,072
我妻子说了实话
My wife confessed to something she didn't do.

334
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:47,078
而你却用烧开的油烫她的手臂
She confessed when you poured a pan of boiling oil over her arms.

335
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,044
不 你一定弄错了...
No, I did not. You have the wrong...

336
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:54,032
承认吧!
Admit it!

337
00:25:54,033 --> 00:26:00,062
我不能承认我没做过的事
I cannot admit to something I didn't do.

338
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:12,067
今天到此为止吧
That is enough for today.

339
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,070
我明天还会再来
Then I will see you tomorrow.

那你还来和我说什么

输了就输了吧...

你曾是达摩的一员吗?
Were you ever a member of the Dharma Initiative,

423
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:26,000
还是你一开始就在撒谎?

424
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,055
我当然是在浪费时间

426
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,072
"大清洗"后我来到了这个站点
I moved into the station after the purge.

427
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,076
哪个科考团队会袭击你们呢?
The purge, in which a group of scientists attacked your people?

428
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:41,099
你相不相信随你便 但这些确实发生了
Believe what you want, but that is what happened.

429
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,036
你的朋友..他们死了吗?
Your friends.. did he kill them?

430
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:45,037
没有
No.

431
00:34:45,038 --> 00:34:48,007
他们正在搜集那个农舍可利用的资源
They're collecting whatever may be useful from the farmhouse

432
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:50,090
现在有人可以带我们去"The others"那里了
and now we have our ticket to where the others live

433
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:54,043
我们就能找到Jack和你的女儿
where we'll find your daughter and Jack

434
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:57,063
也许还能找到回家的路
and finally, perhaps, a way home.

435
00:34:57,064 --> 00:35:04,008
我不会带你们去那里的
There is nothing you could do to me that would make me lead you there.

436
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:10,055
我没有说过让你带路
I didn't say you were our ticket, did I?

437
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:21,038
这张地图显示与火焰舱连接的各个电缆
This is a map showing electrical and data cabling running from the Flame here,

438
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,076
这个地方叫"the barracks"
to a place called "the Barracks," here.

439
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:28,054
这是个包括有水和电的住宅区
It's comprised of houses and dormitories with water and power

440
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:33,002
那些能源足够能提供给整个社区
large enough to accommodate an entire community.

441
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:37,037
那地方一定很值得拜访
Sounds like a place well worth visiting, don't you think?

442
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:40,067
你们的警惕会降低
There will come a time when your guard is down

443
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:47,090
到时我会毫不留情的杀了你们
and when it is, I will not hesitate a moment before killing you.

444
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:51,091
-你应该知道这点  -他说到点子上了
-You should know this before  -He's making an excellent point.

445
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:53,040
我们有地图
You have a map.

446
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:58,048
为什么要让他活着?
Why keep him alive?

447
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:27,038
我和丈夫到巴黎后
After my husband and I first arrived to Paris

448
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,076
我总是不敢走出公寓一步
I was afraid to ever leave our apartment.

449
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:36,080
所以我透过窗户看着小巷
So I would stare out the window into the alley

450
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:40,073
我看见这只猫在寻找剩饭菜
and I would see this cat looking for scraps.

451
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:46,074
一天 一群孩子把它关在一个箱子里
One day, some children came into the alley and trapped him in a box.

452
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:55,014
我看着他们往箱子里投入爆竹
I watched them light firecrackers and drop them in the box.

453
00:36:55,015 --> 00:37:01,048
我从三楼就能听到它的嚎叫
I could hear him howl from three stories above.

454
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:08,016
终于 我有理由走出我的公寓
So finally, I had a reason to leave my apartment.

455
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:13,001
我救了这只猫 把它带回了家
I rescued this cat, and I brought him home.

456
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:16,070
当我阅读时 它总在身边
He sits with me when I read.

457
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:26,011
当我睡觉时 它总是发出咕噜声
He sleeps with me, and he purrs.

458
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:30,068
但..总有那么些时候
But.. every once in a while

459
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:37,023
它会咬我 抓我
he will bite me or scratch me.

460
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:46,030
它这样做是因为它害怕了
He does this because sometimes he forgets that he is safe now.

461
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:51,031
所以我任凭它咬我
So I forgive him when he bites me

462
00:37:51,032 --> 00:38:00,041
因为我知道它受过的伤害
because I know what it is like to never feel safe.

463
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:06,017
都是因为你
And that is because of you.

464
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:15,019
所以今天...我只问你一件事
So today...I ask only one thing of you.

465
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:20,014
我要你向我承认
I ask you now that you show me the respect

466
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:24,093
你对我做的一切...
of acknowledging what you did to me...

467
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:32,061
是你拷问我 折磨我...
that it was you who questioned me, that tortured me...

468
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:38,036
你记得我
and that you remember me.

469
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:55,069
我记得你
I remember you.

470
00:38:56,076 --> 00:39:01,035
我记得你的脸
I remember your face.

471
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:08,064
你的脸总让我心神不宁
Your face has haunted me ever since I left Iraq.

472
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:26,021
我很抱歉
I am sorry.

473
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:32,073
抱歉我对你做的一切
I am so sorry for what I did to you.

474
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:47,013
我原谅你
I forgive you.

475
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:57,048
当我丈夫回来后 我会告诉他我犯了一个错误
When my husband returns, I will tell him I made a terrible mistake

476
00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:02,025
那个人不是你...
that it was not you...

477
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:05,072
然后他会放了你
and he will release you.

478
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:08,052
为什么?
Why ?

479
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:11,079
你为什么让我走?
Why are you letting me go?

480
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:19,043
我们都能做到那些孩子对这只猫做的事...
We are all capable of doing what those children did to this cat...

481
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,086
但我不会
but I will not do that.

482
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:27,031
我不会这样做的
I will not be that.

483
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:38,071
我们应该杀了他 Sayid
We should kill him, Sayid.

484
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:44,019
他已经说了他会杀了我们的
He already told us that he would kill us.

485
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:50,029
不
No

486
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,051
他是我的囚犯
He's my prisoner.

487
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:57,070
我来决定他的命运
I will decide his fate.

488
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:03,025
我可以看出这里的东西都没用了
I can see you didn't find anything worth taking.

489
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:06,004
我又玩了那个愚蠢的象棋游戏
Actually, I just played that silly chess game again

490
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:12,039
现在我知道你为什么不让我赢它了
and now I realize why you didn't want me to beat it.

491
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:17,025
那意味着什么?
Meaning what ?

492
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:25,087
你做了什么 John?
What have you done, John?

493
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:29,024
那是唯一有希望和外界联系的地方!
That place was our one hope of communication with the outside world!

494
00:41:29,025 --> 00:41:32,040
那电脑说如果我们被"敌人"入侵
The computer said if there was an incursion by the hostiles

495
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:39,070
我应该输入7-7 所以我就这么做了
I should enter 7-7, so I entered 7-7.

496
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,000
我们应该走了
We should go.

497
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:52,088
如果周围有人的话 他们会被这里的爆炸吸引过来的
If anyone's around, this explosion is going to attract their attention.

498
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,060
