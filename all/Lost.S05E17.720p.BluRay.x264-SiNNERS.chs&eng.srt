1
00:00:02,012 --> 00:00:03,087
《迷失》前情提要
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:03,096 --> 00:00:07,031
Jack要去引爆一颗氢弹
Jack is on his way to blow up a hydrogen bomb.

3
00:00:07,031 --> 00:00:08,067
我们得阻止他
We have to stop him.

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,055
Jack  我们一定要在事情发生的那一刻赶到
Jack, we need to be there at the moment of the incident.

5
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:18,028
怎么停下了
Why the hell are we stopping?

6
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:19,046
看
That's why.

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,043
Kate  怎么了
What's going on, kate?

8
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:31,073
医生 我们需要谈谈
Doc, we gotta talk.

9
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,091
想谈话  那么就上车  我们没时间
You wanna talk? Then get in the van. We don't

10
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:40,002
-我不会上车的
-Have time  -I ain't get in the van.

11
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:41,066
我只需要五分钟就够了
I need five minutes, that's all.

12
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,091
我只说我想说的
I'll say what I gotta say,

13
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,047
然后随便你怎么样都行
And then you can do whatever the hell you want to.

14
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:48,078
但你要听我说  因为你欠我的  Jack
But you're gonna listen. You owe me that much, Jack.

15
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:54,063
五分钟
Five minutes.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,022
Shephard医生  你还好吗
Dr. Shephard? You all right?

17
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:31,085
硬膜囊  我切到了
The dural sac...i cut it.

18
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,052
-帮我吸管  -镇定  没事
-Give me some suction.  -Calm down. It's all right.

19
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,095
-流得到处都是  我不能  -看着我
-The fluid's leaking everywhere. I can't  -Look at me.

20
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,010
-帮我吸管  -是  医生
-Give me some suction.  -Yes, doctor.

21
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,086
Jack  看着我
Jack... look at me.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,046
-数到五  -你在说什么
-Count to five.  -What are you talking about?

23
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:50,041
我是说你要缝上这个切口
I'm talking about you stitching up the sac

24
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:53,050
别让这个女孩残废下半辈子
So this girl isn't paralyzed for the rest of her life.

25
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:57,056
而唯一的方法就是不要害怕
And the only way you're gonna do that is not to be afraid.

26
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,052
所以闭上眼睛  数到五
So close your eyes, count to five,

27
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,095
然后把她治好  Jack 
And then fix her, Jack.

28
00:02:07,017 --> 00:02:09,010
否则就要换我上阵了
Or i'll have to fix her for you.

29
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:20,003
一
One...

30
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,005
二
Two...

31
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,083
三
Three...

32
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:27,019
四
Four...

33
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,074
五
Five.

34
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,054
缝线
Sutures.

35
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:57,016
Hey  孩子  那个女孩正在康复中
Hey, kiddo. Girl's in recovery.

36
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:59,018
她下半身对刺激有反应
She's responsive to stimulus below the waist,

37
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:02,002
所以  不会瘫痪
So... no paralysis.

38
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,089
有什么事吗  Jack
Something wrong, Jack?

39
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:11,022
你真让我丢脸
You embarrassed me.

40
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:13,023
是吗
Did i?

41
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:15,091
让医院所有人
It's bad enough

42
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,039
都认为我之所以得到这个实习机会
That everybody in this hospital thinks

43
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,091
是因为你是我的父亲  
The only reason I got this residency

44
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,018
这已经够糟了  但是你却还-
Is because you're my father. But then you...

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,072
你居然在我第一次大型手术中间叫暂停
You put me in a time-out during my first major procedure,

46
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:27,076
而且还当着所有医护人员的面
In front of my entire team.

47
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:32,034
爸  我知道你不相信我
Dad, I know you don't believe in me,

48
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:34,027
但我需要他们相信
But I need them to.

49
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:37,000
你确定我就是那个
Are you sure I'm the one

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,095
不信任你的人吗  Jack
Who doesn't believe in you, Jack?

51
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:49,051
有一个是你的吗
One of these yours?

52
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:56,038
机器卡住了
Machine got stuck.

53
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:57,096
我看只是缺乏去摇一下它
I guess it just needed a little push.

54
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,081
坐下歇歇吧  医生
Take a load off, doc.

55
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:18,002
不必了  谢谢 
No, thanks.

56
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,017
坐下  Jack 
Sit down, Jack.

57
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:32,018
我父母在我八岁时就去世了
My folks died when I was 8 years old.

58
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,022
我跟你说过吗
I ever tell you that?

59
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,093
我父亲的东西都被骗子骗走了
Con man took my dad for everything he had.

60
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:41,085
他无法控制自己  所以
He didn't handle it too well, so...

61
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:47,029
他开枪打死了我母亲  然后自杀
He shot my mom, then he blew his own head off.

62
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:50,078
事情发生的时候我就躲在床下
I was hiding under the bed when it happened.

63
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,088
我听到了一切
I heard the whole thing.

64
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:57,026
-真抱歉  -是啊
-I'm sorry.  -Yeah.

65
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,094
那是一年前的事了
That was a year ago.

66
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:03,064
什么
What?

67
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:06,052
现在是1977年七月
Right now it's July 1977,

68
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:10,044
这说明那是去年的事
Which means that happened last year.

69
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:13,028
我本可以跳上潜水艇
So I could've hopped on the sub,

70
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:15,014
回到美国
Gone back to the states,

71
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,070
走进我的家
Walked right in my house

72
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:20,025
然后阻止我父亲杀人
And stopped my daddy from killing anybody.

73
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,060
你为什么没这么做
Why didn't you?

74
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:25,013
因为  Jack
Because, Jack...

75
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,027
已经发生的事情不可能挽回
What's done is done.

76
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,025
不一定要那样
It doesn't have to be that way.

77
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:40,010
你到底在想什么竟然发疯到愿意
What did you screw up so bad the first time around

78
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,001
去引爆一个核武器
You're willing to blow up a damn nuke

79
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,007
-来找第2次机会  -不是这样的
-Just for a second chance?  -That's not what this is about.

80
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,032
那是怎么回事
Then what is it about?

81
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,069
三年前
Three years ago,

82
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,044
Locke告诉我所有这一切事出有因
Locke told me that all this was happening for a reason,

83
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,040
我们命中注定要来到这里
That us being here was our destiny.

84
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,075
我不信命
I don't speak "destiny."

85
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:04,047
当一个人尽自己所能做某件事的时候
What I do understand is a man does what he does

86
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:06,012
他一定是为了什么目标
'cause he wants something for himself.

87
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,011
你的目标是什么  Jack
What do you want, Jack?

88
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:24,016
她曾经和我在一起
I had her.

89
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:29,011
我们在一起  然后我失去了她
I had her, and I lost her.

90
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,007
Kate
Kate.

91
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:35,074
那么好吧  医生
Well, damn, doc,

92
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:37,061
她就在这些树的背后
She's standing right on the other side of those trees.

93
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:39,065
你想追回她  就去问她啊
You want her back, just go and ask her.

94
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,028
不  已经太晚了
Nah, it's too late for that.

95
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:50,062
你的五分钟到了
Your five minutes is up.

96
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,074
Jack
Jack...

97
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,090
就算你的方法可行
If what you're doin' even works,

98
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,072
你和Kate还是会分道扬镳
You and kate will be strangers,

99
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,099
而且她会被戴上手铐
And she'll be in damn handcuffs.

100
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:02,055
如果这是命中注定  我们也只能认命
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

101
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,034
那么  我看我说什么
Well, I guess there's nothing I can say

102
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:10,091
-都改变不了你的主意了  -没错
-That's gonna change your mind.  -No, I guess there's not.

103
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,060
你觉得你算什么
Who the hell do you think you are?!

104
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,045
你以为可以来这里
You think you can come here

105
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:30,079
然后为所欲为吗
And do whatever the hell you want?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,025
这是我的家
I had a life here!

107
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,068
Sawyer
Sawyer...

108
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,091
你会住手吗
Will you stop?

109
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,043
-你会不会住手  -不会
-Will you stop?!  -No.

110
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,066
James
James!

111
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:09,076
放开他
Let him go.

112
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:13,037
他不听  我必须这么做  他不肯住手
He wouldn't listen. i had to. he won't stop!

113
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:15,022
那是因为他做得对
That's because he's right.

114
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:17,051
什么
What?!

115
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,047
他说的对  James
He's right, James.

116
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:21,013
我们是迫不得已
We have to do this.

117
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,029
你在说什么
What are you talking about?!

118
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,035
是你叫我回来阻止他的
You're the one that told me to come back here and stop him!

119
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,026
怎么回事
What happened?!

120
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:32,028
我改主意了
I changed my mind.

121
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:02,065
女孩们  爸爸和我有些事情
Girls... your dad and I have something

122
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,052
要告诉你们两个
We need to talk to you both about.

123
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:06,064
我们又要搬家了吗
Are we moving again?

124
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,070
不是  笨蛋  是他们要离婚了
No, stupid. They're getting a divorce.

125
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,047
-Rachel  -不是吗
- Rachel... - well, aren't you?

126
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:14,067
-是的  -但是
- Yes. - But...

127
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,039
你们要知道
We need you both to understand

128
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,026
爸爸和我
That your father and I...

129
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,043
我们仍旧相爱
We still love each other.

130
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,054
只是因为两人相爱
Just because two people love each other,

131
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:26,017
并不意味着他们就要在一起
Doesn't always mean they're supposed to be together.

132
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:28,059
可你们不是应该在一起的吗
But what if you are supposed to be together?

133
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,015
我们不是的  亲爱的
We're not, honey.

134
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:33,098
-你们凭什么那么肯定  -我们就是知道
- But how can you know for sure? - We just know.

135
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,069
以后你长大了
And when you're a grown-up,

136
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,028
也会知道的
You'll understand.

137
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:43,009
我才不想知道呢
I don't wanna understand!

138
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,002
Juliet  等等
Juliet, wait!

139
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,003
我永远都不想知道
I don't wanna understand!

140
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,049
停下  我们得好好谈谈
Stop! We gotta talk about this!

141
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,068
没什么好谈的了  James
There's nothing to talk about, James.

142
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:52,066
我们要让Jack完成他来这的使命
We have to let Jack do what he came here to do.

143
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,099
或许你应该在我把他赶出丛林前
Well, maybe you should told me you had a change of heart

144
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:57,018
告诉我你变心了
Before I brought him out in the jungle to kick his ass.

145
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,020
那样做你就舒服了吗
Would that soft you?

146
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,040
-没有  -那好  我很高兴
- No. - well, then I'm glad you finally

147
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,029
你终于能换个方式思考了
Got it out of your systerm.

148
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,057
-嘿  嘿  -别这样
- Hey! hey! - You, don't.

149
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:07,092
你得告诉我整个的来龙去脉
I need you to tell me where all this is coming from.

150
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:11,048
我是说  1分钟前  你还在带领大家逃亡
I mean, one minute, you're leading the great sub escape,

151
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:14,004
而现在你却在指挥炸毁这该死的岛
And now you're on board with blowing up the damn island?

152
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:18,026
我有权知道你改变主意的原因
I got a right to know why you changed your mind.

153
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:24,003
我改主意是因为我看见你在看她
I changed my mind when I saw you look at her.

154
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,014
别  别这样
Don't. don't.

155
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:31,080
我可不管我在看谁
I don't care who I looked at.

156
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:34,031
我爱的是你
I'm with you.

157
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,060
如果我愿意  你会和我永远在一起
And you would stay with me forever if I let you,

158
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,016
这也是我爱你的原因
And that is why I will always love you.

159
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,035
你不爱我的  我们拥有的只是一段短暂的时光
You don't... what we had, it was just for a little while.

160
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,067
只是因为我们相爱
And just because we love each other,

161
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,087
并不意味着我们就要在一起
It doesn't mean that we're meant to be together.

162
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:50,033
我是说  或许我们永远不要奢望能在一起
I mean, maybe we were never supposed to be together.

163
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,094
所以如果Jack可以
So if Jack can make it that...

164
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:55,026
阻止你们从一开始来这里 他就必须做
that none of you ever come here  Then he should.

165
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:00,009
Juliet  你为什么要这样做
Why you doing this, Juliet?

166
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,024
我...
I...

167
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:16,002
若我从没遇见过你  那么我就永远不会失去你了
If I never meet you, then I never have to lose you.

168
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:31,072
Radzinsky
Radzinsky!

169
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,061
现在怎么样了
What is it now?!

170
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:35,084
高斯指针已经跳出图表范围了
The gauss readings has jumped off the charts.

171
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,034
我来看看
Let me see.

172
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:42,067
就是它了  我们脚下就有能量袋
This is it! We're on top of the pocket!

173
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,039
如果我们继续钻  直到抵达能量袋
If we keep drilling and hit that pocket,

174
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,028
地狱将会降临
All hell is gonna break loose!

175
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,085
radzinsky  你
radzinsky, are y

176
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:51,088
-Stuart  快下来  -你想怎么样  Phil
- Stuart, come in! - What do you want, Phil?

177
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:54,014
那个朝孩子开枪的敌人  他回来了
That hostile that shot the kid? He came back.

178
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:56,020
你到底在说什么啊
What the hell are you talking about?

179
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,077
就在兵营里  他  他袭击我们
Here at the barracks. He...he attacked us

180
00:11:58,077 --> 00:12:00,055
然后被他的同伙救走了
And then got rescued by some of the other recruits.

181
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:01,072
他们偷了一辆货车逃跑了  
They stole a van and took off.

182
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,041
去了哪里
Took off where?

183
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:04,068
不知道
I don't know,

184
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:06,066
Roger说他们其中一人携带有炸弹
But Roger said that one of them had a bomb.

185
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,024
那人知道天鹅站
That hostile knows about the swan!

186
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:11,085
召集人手  带上枪
Get some men and some guns,

187
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:13,058
赶快到这边来
And get your asses out here right now!

188
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,057
如果他们朝这边来  我们可要好好准备了
If they're coming here, we're gonna be ready for 'em.

189
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:20,008
快点
Come on!

190
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:25,007
Jack  怎么回事
Jack? What happened?

191
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:30,013
我和Sawyer不欢而散
Yeah, my talk with Sawyer didn't go so good.

192
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:32,059
很疼吗
Does it hurt?

193
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:34,049
-还好吧  -那就好
- Ah, it's okay. - Okay.

194
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,092
还记得我们相遇吗  我们第一次到这里时
Do you remember when I sewed you up? when we first got here?

195
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,025
像是很久远的事情了
Seems like a million years ago.

196
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,016
或者是30年后的事情
Or 30 years from now.

197
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,074
Kate  为什么要我承诺永不问起Aaron呢
Kate, why'd you make me promise to never ask about Aaron?

198
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:13,027
因为我
Because I was...

199
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:17,092
很生气你叫我又回到这里
So angry with you for making me come back here.

200
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:21,036
是因为他你才回来的吗
Is he why you came back?

201
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,040
我回来了  他就能和他母亲一起
I came back so he could be where he belongs...

202
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,067
回到他应该在的地方了
With his mother.

203
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:31,050
如果这样做有用  Claire就不会来到这个岛上
If this works, Claire will never come to the land,

204
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,023
他们就能永远在一起了
And they'll always be together,

205
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,043
就像他们想的那样
Just the way they're meant to be.

206
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:35,039
可是她当时想不要他
She was gonna give him up for

207
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,063
你不会知道她要做什么的
Well, you don't know what she would do.

208
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:39,096
不管做什么  都是她自己的选择
And whatever it is, it would be her choice.

209
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,051
如果你还想救Claire  这是唯一的方法
If you wanna save Claire, this is the only way to do it.

210
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:48,067
我在我一生中从未这么肯定过
Nothing... nothing in my life has ever felt so right.

211
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,010
还有
And...

212
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,094
我希望你能相信我
I just need you to believe that.

213
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:05,008
继续
Go!

214
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:07,005
继续钻
Keep going!

215
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:12,059
继续钻下去
Keep the drill going!

216
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:14,014
有事要发生了
It's about to happen.

217
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,012
你支持我吗
Are you with me on this?

218
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:29,002
是的
Yes.

219
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:30,034
那我们走
Then let's go.

220
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,097
一个皮夹
One wallet.

221
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,097
227美元现金
$227 cash.

222
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,015
一支圆珠笔
One ballpoint pen.

223
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,031
一块水果糖
One fruit roll-up.

224
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,058
在这签个字
Sign here.

225
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,051
你不知道  这是个超级失误
You don't understand. This is a big mistake.

226
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,017
我杀了一群人
I killed a bunch of people.

227
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,034
看到这个了吗
You see this?

228
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,021
这是释放表格  你已经被证明无罪了
This is a discharge form. You've been cleared.

229
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:10,078
-拿上你的东西走吧  -我说  老兄
- So take your stuff and go. - Look, dude...

230
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,000
有人拿着麻醉枪
There are men with tranquilizer guns

231
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,054
像狩猎一样追捕我
Hunting me down like an animal.

232
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:16,052
他们会不顾我的意愿把我带走
They wanna bring me somewhere against my will.

233
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:19,081
外面就有一辆出租车
There's a cab stand right out front.

234
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:30,048
对不起  我不知道已经有人坐了
Oh. Sorry. I didn't see it was taken, dude.

235
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,004
实际上  我过几条街就下了
Actually, I'm only going a few blocks

236
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:33,008
我们可以一起
If you wanna share.

237
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:35,022
进来吧
Come on in.

238
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:45,061
吃糖吗 樱桃味的
You want some? Cherry.

239
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:47,001
不要  谢谢
No thanks.

240
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,070
你怎么进去的
So what were you in for?

241
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,004
什么
Excuse me?

242
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:53,030
监狱
Jail.

243
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,057
我进去的罪名是杀了三个人
I was there 'cause i killed three people.

244
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:58,099
可我并没有  我想他们搞清楚了
But i didn't really. i guess they figured it out.

245
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:01,009
你呢
What about you?

246
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,069
我没坐牢
I wasn't in jail.

247
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,092
那你在监狱外面干什么
Well, then what were you doing sitting outside a prison?

248
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:09,073
还坐在出租车里
In a cab?

249
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,032
Hugo  我是在等你
I was waitin' for you, Hugo.

250
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:17,098
那你肯定已经死了
Then you must be dead.

251
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,004
我确定我现在活着
I'm definitely not dead.

252
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,007
你想要我做什么
Well, what do you want from me?

253
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,040
我想知道为什么你不回岛上去
I wanna know why you won't go back to the island.

254
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,018
因为我被诅咒了
'cause i'm cursed.

255
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,013
是这样吗
Is that so?

256
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:43,063
所以飞机才会坠毁  我的朋友才会死
That's why the plane crashed, my friends died...

257
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:45,070
Libby  Charlie
Libby, Charlie.

258
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,061
现在他们来找我了
Now they visit me,

259
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,038
而我没办法阻止
And i can't make it stop.

260
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,040
如果并不是被诅咒呢
Well, what if you weren't cursed?

261
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:56,015
要是你是被保佑的呢
What if you were blessed?

262
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,096
你说的保佑是指什么
How do you mean "blessed?"

263
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:01,027
那你得和你失去的人们谈谈
Well, you get to talk to people you've lost...

264
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,084
这事对于我而言很神奇
Seems like a pretty wonderful thing to me.

265
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,053
我肯定那是很神奇的
Oh, i'm sure it's wonderful,

266
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:08,009
除了我发疯的那部分
Except for the part where i'm crazy.

267
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,075
Hugo  我有些消息要告诉你
I've got some news for you, Hugo,

268
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:12,042
你得相信我说的话
And you're just gonna have to take my word on this.

269
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:15,006
你并没有发疯
You are not crazy.

270
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,037
老兄  你到底是谁
Who are you, dude?

271
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,025
我在路口下车
I'm just up here on the corner.

272
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:31,018
Ajira航空  316航班  洛杉矶国际机场
Ajira airways flight 316 out of l.a.x.

273
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,076
24小时内起飞
Leaves in 24 hours.

274
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:34,093
你要做的就是坐上那趟飞机
All you have to do is get on that plane.

275
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,019
Hugo  由你选择
It's your choice, Hugo.

276
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,071
你不必做那些你不愿意做的事
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.

277
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:47,077
等等  你的吉他
Wait! you forgot your guitar.

278
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:49,023
这不是我的吉他
It's not my guitar.

279
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:58,054
一切都会好起来的  待Jack改变未来
Everything'll be fine when Jack changes the future...

280
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,052
或者改变过去
Or the past.

281
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,003
哪个都行
One of those.

282
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,056
我不认为你的朋友能办到
I don't think your bud's gonna make it.

283
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
他能行的
He'll make it.

284
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:10,093
你脸上怎么了
Dude, what happened to your face?

285
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:13,001
没什么
Nothin'.

286
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,005
我们刚爬上了山脊
We were just up on a ridge

287
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,057
从那里能俯瞰天鹅站
Where we could look down into the swan site.

288
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,004
那里出事了
Something just happened down there.

289
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:24,074
他们钻到了什么  我该去了
They hit something. it's time for me to go.

290
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:26,054
都准备好了
It's all set to go.

291
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,006
记住  要当心
Remember, be careful.

292
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:31,062
它被设定成受到撞击就引爆
It's rigged to explode on impact.

293
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:34,048
根据Faraday的计划
According to Faraday's plan,

294
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:36,044
你必须让炸弹
You must get the bomb as close as you can

295
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:38,040
尽可能靠近磁源
To the source of electromagnetism.

296
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,091
Sayid  计划会成功的
Sayid, this is gonna work.

297
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,063
你会得救的
And it'll save ya.

298
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:47,096
没什么能救得了我
Nothing can save me.

299
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,032
我们洛杉矶再会
See ya in los angeles.

300
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:09,074
这是什么  我们怎么停下了
What is it? Why are we stopping?

301
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,041
你会知道的
You'll see.

302
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,098
这只脚挺好看,Richard 但是和Jacob有什么关系
Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard,but what's it have to do with Jacob?

303
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,073
他住在这里
It's where he lives.

304
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:12,072
我的天
Oh, my God!

305
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,057
我的天  快报警
Oh, my God! Call 911!

306
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,075
别担心  不会有事的
Don't worry,everything's gonna be all right.

307
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,088
我对你的遭遇感到遗憾
I'm sorry this happened to you.

308
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:13,049
你确定要这么做吗
Are you sure you need to do this?

309
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:17,080
如果你再等等  Jacob总会来找你的
If you waited, Jacob would eventually come to you, John.

310
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,023
我等烦了  Richard  他在哪儿呢
I'm tired of waiting. where is he, Richard?

311
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:32,011
剩下的雕像怎么了
What happened to the rest of the statue?

312
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,007
我不知道  我到这儿时就这样了
I don't know. it was like that when i got here.

313
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:39,061
你要我相信这话吗
Do you expect me to believe that?

314
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:43,084
不尽然
Not really.

315
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:46,093
好了  Ben  我们走了
All right, Ben, let's go.

316
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:00,067
你来干什么
W-what are you doing?

317
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:04,063
John要我跟他一起
John wants me to join him.

318
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:06,029
-你不能带上他  -为什么不能
- You can't bring him in. - Why not?

319
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:08,080
因为只有我们的领导者才能和Jacob对话
Because only our leader can request an audience with Jacob,

320
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,044
岛上一次只能有一位领导者
And there can only be one leader on the island

321
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:11,006
John  我
At a time, John. I'm

322
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:14,039
Richard  你去慢慢制定你的那些规则吧
You just make these rules up as you go along, Richard.

323
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:18,004
Ben得跟着我  要是出了什么问题
Ben is coming in with me, and if that's a problem,

324
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:19,085
我相信Jacob和我能解决
I'm sure Jacob and i can work it out.

325
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,059
代我问好
Tell him i said hello.

326
00:24:29,098 --> 00:24:31,059
你能下得了手吧  Ben
Will you be able to do this, Ben?

327
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:35,022
我知道这不容易
I know it won't be easy,

328
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:38,062
但情况会改变的  一旦他消失了
But things will change... once he's gone.

329
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:46,029
我保证
I promise.

330
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:17,098
能问你件事吗  Lafleur
Can i ask you something, Lafleur?

331
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:21,001
这里已经没有Lafleur了  说吧  Enos
There ain't no more Lafleur, Enos. go ahead, shoot.

332
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:24,021
你们有没有想过
Has it occurred to any of you that your buddy's

333
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,016
你的朋友是要去引发那件
Actually gonna cause the thing

334
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,071
他说他想要避免的事
He says he's trying to prevent

335
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:33,027
也许核武器就是那行动
Perhaps that little nuke is the incident?

336
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:36,063
所以也许最好我们
So maybe the best thing to do...

337
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,016
什么都不要做
Is nothing?

338
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:44,037
我很高兴你们都想清楚了
I'm glad you all thought this through.

339
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:50,082
出什么事了
What's going on?

340
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:52,058
是Phil
It's Phil.

341
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:54,022
那是去swan的路
That's the road to the swan.

342
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:57,048
要是他们见到Jack  他们会杀了他的
If they see Jack, they're gonna kill him.

343
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:00,083
金发女  你怎么想
What do you think, Blondie?

344
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,024
一起生活  独自死去
Live together, die alone.

345
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:23,017
-你来得真快  -有没有发现他们的行迹
- Good for you. you got here fast. - Any sign of 'em yet?

346
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,091
还没有  你还有时间在外围设防
No, not yet. you got time to set up a perimeter.

347
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:26,025
你安排这些人就位
you called these men to reset

348
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:28,067
你  山后  你  山顶
You, rear ridgeline. you, top ridgeline.

349
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:30,093
你得带你的人离开这里
we need to be getting your people away from here.

350
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:32,098
你  上脚手架  马上去
You, top of the scaffolding. go now!

351
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,016
在那儿
There!

352
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,023
抓住他
Get him!

353
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:26,034
包抄他  把他抓住
Flank him! Get him now!

354
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,014
是谁
Who's this?!

355
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:14,095
-放下枪  Phil  不然你就死定了  -好  好
- Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man! - Okay, okay.

356
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,032
让他们把枪放下
Tell 'em to put their guns down.

357
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,053
把枪放下
Drop the guns!

358
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:22,094
你可以出来了  医生
All right, you can come out now, Doc!

359
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:33,015
赶紧去做你的事
Hurry up and do your business.

360
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,016
把那该死的东西关了
Turn that damn thing off!

361
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:46,010
怎么回事
What's the matter?!

362
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:49,000
关不上了
It won't shut down!

363
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:50,051
为什么关不上
Why not?!

364
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:52,019
有东西在往下拽钻头
Something's pulling the drill down.

365
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:53,091
我们钻到那能量袋了
We hit the pocket!

366
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:07,001
快点  医生  还等什么呢  扔下去
Hurry up, Doc! what are you waiting for?! drop it!

367
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:04,046
这看起来不像L.A.X
This don't look like L.A.X

368
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,052

别离开我

-我爱你  -别放手

00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:42,086
没关系
It's okay.

雕像阴影下是什么

你在哪找到他的

在飞船的货舱里  我们来这的那艘

415

00:36:42,004 --> 00:36:43,027

问题

你们终于不无视我了

整整35年  我都住在这个岛上

但是当我终于有勇气要求要见你的时候

你得有耐心

但是他要见你的时候呢

他像摩西一样大步走来

我到底有什么问题
What was it that was so wrong with me?
