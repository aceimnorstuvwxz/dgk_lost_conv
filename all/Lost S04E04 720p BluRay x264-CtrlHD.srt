00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:59,032
这是最后的两个蛋了
These are the last two eggs.

5
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,069
从我书架上拿来的?
From my own bookshelf?

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,055
-帮你打发一下时间  -这本我都看过了
Help you pass the time. I've already read it.

7
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,055
看第二遍可以让你温故知新
You might catch something you missed the second time around.

8
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:21,045
你为什么要把我从关押室转到这里来?
Why did you move me from the rec room down here?

9
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,085
我想让你呆在我眼皮底下
I wanted you under my own roof.

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,055
你把其他人关在哪儿?  Miles 是叫这个名字吧
Where are you keeping your other prisoner? miles, is it?

11
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:32,055
看来你不想告诉我
Oh, you don't want to share.

12
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,082
事实上  Ben  我倒是希望你能告诉我点什么
Actually, I was hoping you would share, ben,

13
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:37,085
既然你都说了在船上有个内线
Seeing as you claim to have a spy on his ship.

14
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:44,062
John  我真同情你
I feel for you, john.

15
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:46,085
发自内心的同情你
I really do.

16
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:49,012
你不断的碰壁
You keep hitting dead ends.

17
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,032
找不到想要的答案
You couldn't find the cabin.

18
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:55,035
你没法感受到Jacob
You can't make contact with jacob.

19
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,092
你如此绝望的想知道下一步该怎么做
You're so desperate to figure out what to do next,

20
00:01:57,092 --> 00:02:00,089
你甚至现在都问到我头上来了
You're even asking me for help.

21
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:06,082
既然这样  还是像从前那样
So here we are, just like old times...

22
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,035
你把我换到另外的房间去
Except I'm locked in a different room.

23
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,099
不然你只会更郁闷
And you're more lost than you ever were.

24
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:18,012
我知道你有什么企图
I know what you're trying to do.

25
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,079
没用的
It's not gonna work.

26
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:21,089
不错嘛  John  你变机灵了
Excellent, john. you're evolving.

27
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:24,005
早饭吃完了吧
Done with your breakfast?

28
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:47,025
那是怎么回事?
What's that all about?

29
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,079
谁知道呢  Locke就这样的
Who knows? it's locke.

30
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:55,062
女士们  早上好

31
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:56,092

33
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:01,099
咖啡闻起来很香啊
Mmm, coffee smells good.

34
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:05,065
好吧  我去给你倒一杯
Well... why don't I go make you a cup?

35
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:15,042
感觉有点怪吧  不是吗
Kinda weird, ain't it?

36
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:18,092
悠闲的坐在前廊  一杯杯喝咖啡
Sittin' on porches, drinking coffee out of mugs.

37
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:21,075
我找到一些你可以穿的衣服

38
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,095
挂在一个衣橱里面的
Hung 'em in a closet.

39
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,082
那么在我赶走Hugo之后
So after I kick out hugo...

40
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,062
James  我不会和你一起住的
I'm not moving in with you, james.

41
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:31,049
好吧  那你干嘛留下来
Well... then why did you stay?

42
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:33,089
这不关你的事
That's none of your business.

43
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:36,062
你是不是有个什么秘密计划?
Oh, you got a secret agenda, huh?

44
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,089
要是你帮Jack做内线的话
Well, if you're spying for jack-

45
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:41,013
-我没有替任何人做内线  -那你干嘛不告诉我...
I'm not spying for anyone. so why don't you tell me-

46
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,069
因为我不相信你
Because I don't trust you.

47
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:49,045
看来是跟怀孕的事有关
This is about the pregnancy thing.

48
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:55,015
James...
James...

49
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,042

54
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,051
这里有后门吗

55
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,047
是有  但是你要从前门

141
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,062
你知道我做过什么吗
Do you know what I did?

142
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:53,056
你做过什么
What did you do?

143
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:55,052
回答我的问题
Answer the question.

144
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,096
好吧
Okay.

145
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:04,062
我会给你想要的答案
I'll tell you what you want to know,

146
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,029
但你得先为我做点事情
But you gotta do something for me first.

147
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,049
我不会放你走的
I'm not letting you go.

148
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:13,022
我不想被放走  这就是我想来的地方
I don't want to be let go. I am exactly where I want to be.

149
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:17,039
我要的是...
What I want...

150
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,028
和一个人
Is one minute...

151
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,079
待上一会儿
Of someone's time.

152
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,079
你把他带给我
You bring him to me,

153
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,096
我就告诉你所有关于你的事情
And I will tell you everything I know about you.

154
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,076
你要的是谁
Who?

155
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,029
你觉得还能是谁呢
Who do you think?

156
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:52,026
你还好吧
You okay?

157
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,016
我还好
Yeah, I'm fine.

158
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:58,052
听着  地区检察官要亲自做这个案子
Listen, the d.a.'s decided to try this case herself,

159
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:01,016
这就意味着他们会全力以赴
Which means they're gonna do the full court press,

160
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:03,086
我们就得想法庭外调解
And we need to start talking about cutting a deal.

161
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,066
怎么个调解
What kind of deal?

162
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,046
老实说  据我最乐观的估计
Honestly, my best guess,

163
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:09,092
可能她会判你个15年
I'd say she'll take a 15-year sentence,

164
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:11,017
你服刑到第7年可以申请假释
And you serve seven.

165
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,036
没门
No way.

166
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,096
Kate 如果你的案子庭审的话
If you go to trial, kate,

167
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:17,043
每项罪名都会让你关上个20年
You're looking at 20 years on each count,

168
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:20,013
-更别说你那项谋杀罪名就得判个终身监禁 -不行
Not to mention a life sentence on the murder charge. no.

169
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,090
Kate  你都向你妈亲口供认
Kate, you confessed to your mother

170
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:23,023
是你杀害了你父亲
That you killed your father,

171
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:26,046
现在她成了有力的人证
And now she's their star witness.

172
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,010
那你来告诉我  我该怎么办
So you tell me- what am I supposed to do?

173
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,046
-我要怎么才能赢这场官司  -带我上法庭吧
How am I supposed to win this thing? put me on the stand.

174
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:34,036
然后期望地区检察官放你一马?  不可能的
And take a chance with the d. a. crossing you? no.

175
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,046
依我之见  我们可以博一把
Way I see it, we've got one shot at this.

176
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,093
-是什么  -我们在身份上做文章
What's that? we make it about character,

177
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:43,053
不去纠结于你做过或没做过这些
Not about what you did or didn't do,

178
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,053
而在于你是什么人
But about who you are.

179
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:48,000
什么意思  我是什么人?
What do you mean, who I am?

180
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:51,096
我想让他出席法庭
I want him in the courtroom.

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,003
-绝对不行  -Kate  我们需要他去
Absolutely not. we need him, kate.

182
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,016
这会带来极大的同情关注
It'll generate tremendous sympathy.

183
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:58,019
Duncan  听我说  你不能把他带过去
Duncan, listen to me. you are not bringing him in here.

184
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:01,039
好吧,你想这么做这案子,关于我的身份？可以
All right, you wanna make this about me, about my character? Fine

185
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,069
但你就是不能利用我儿子
But you are not using my son.

186
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:12,094
或许我们还可以试着
Maybe we should try a number

187
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,031
打一打除了那船以外的号码  比如说911
Other than the boat, like... 9-1-1.

188
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:21,018
怎么回事?
What's wrong?

189
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:22,054
没事
Nothing.

190
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:25,078
就是跟那船的联系出了点问题
We're just having some trouble getting ahold of their boat.

191
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,001
你还没有Sayid的消息吗  你说他们昨天就走了
You haven't heard from sayid? you said they left yesterday.

192
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,088
我确定他们应该没事
And I'm sure they're fine.

193
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,091
万一Locke是对的呢
What if locke was right?

194
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:37,018
万一这些人真的是来伤害我们的?
What if these people are here to hurt us?

195
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:39,051
Locke做事情没理智的
Locke has no idea what he's doing.

196
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:42,015
那为什么Kate留在他那边?
Then why is kate with him?

197
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,025
你确定他把Ben关在地下室吗
You sure he's got ben in his basement?

198
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,051
恩  我看到Rousseau昨晚把他带过去的
Uh-huh. I saw rousseau take him in there last night.

199
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:01,065
-Locke出去过吗   -没有  他整天在里面烧菜弄饭
Does locke ever go out? no. he's been in there cooking all day.

200
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,078
他邀请我们大家去晚餐
He invited us all over for dinner.

201
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:07,051
你能帮我带一下Aaron吗
Oh, can you get aaron for me?

202
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:13,061
就是把他抱起来  轻轻的摇摇拍拍
Just pick him up and rock him a little bit.

203
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:20,045
我有点不大擅长和婴儿打交道
Yeah, I'm just... not very good with babies.

204
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,048
我不想把他弄得更不舒服
I wouldn't want him to get more upset.

205
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,041
好吧  我来抱他
Here, I got him.

206
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,018
没事的
It's okay.

207
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,015
小宝贝  到这儿来
Here we go, muffin.

208
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:37,038
对了  抱住你了
Yeah. there we go.

209
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,098
你真会带他
You're so good with him.

210
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,001
是吗
What?

211
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,051
我从没想过
Just the last thing

212
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:48,071
自己能够当个好妈妈
I ever thought I'd be good at is being a mum.

213
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:51,055
你知道  有时你得试着去做
You know, you should try it sometime.

214
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:53,061
Aaron  别哭了  亲爱的
Hey, aaron. come on, sweetie.

215
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,065
请起身
Please rise.

216
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:06,045
现在开庭  请就座
Court is now in session. please be seated.

217
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,059
不要怪我  好吗
Don't fire me, okay?

218
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:15,095
什么
What?

219
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,079
一开始你就败仗阵来  我必须这样做
We got killed in the opening. I had to do this.

220
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:20,082
被告有证人没有
Does the defense have a witness?

221
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,032
是的  有  法官大人
Yes, we do, your honor.

222
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:25,072
被告传召Jack Shephard医生
The defense calls dr. jack shephard

223
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:27,039
到证人席
To the witness stand.

224
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,039
法官大人  基于他们的关系
Your honor, I'd like to renew my objection to this witness

225
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,015
我重申反对传唤这为证人
On the basis of relevance.

226
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,019
反对无效
And I'm going to renew my overruling of your objection.

227
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,045
你们知道  该证人
You are to be aware that this witness

228
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:49,045
在被告被控告有罪后
Did not meet the defendant

229
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,089
才认识的
Until after the alleged crimes she is being charged with.

230
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,079
他只能视为被告的品德信誉见证人
He's to be viewed as a character witness only.

231
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:57,015
请继续
Proceed.

232
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:59,005
请举起右手
Please raise your right hand.

233
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,069
你能向上帝发誓你所说的话
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

234
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:04,052
-全部是事实吗?  -是的
And nothing but the truth so help you god? yes.

235
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,049
Shephard医生
Dr. shephard...

236
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:15,049
你能告诉陪审团
Could you please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury-

237
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:17,059
你们之中谁没有读过报纸
If there are any of you who don't read newspapers

238
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,085
上过网或看过电视...
Or the internet or watch television...

239
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,032
你是怎样认识被告的
How you met the defendant?

240
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:25,042
在2004年9月22日
On september 22, 2004,

241
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,075
Kate...
Kate...

242
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,049
我和Austen小姐
Miss austen and i

243
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:33,085
是大洋815航班的乘客
Were both passengers on oceanic flight 815,

244
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,072
该飞机坠毁在南太平洋一个岛上
Which crash-landed on an island in the south pacific.

245
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:39,022
你知道Austen小姐是一名逃亡者吗?
Were you aware that miss austen was a fugitive

246
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,072
知道她由一名美国执行官押送
Being transported by a united states marshal

247
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:45,062
-乘座飞机到洛杉矶接受审讯吗?  -是的  我知道
On that flight to los angeles for trial? I did learn that eventually, yes.

248
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:47,012
是从美国执行官那得知的吗?
From the u.s. marshal?

249
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,039
不是  执行官在坠毁中死了
No, the marshal died in the crash.

250
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,079
我从来没有和他说过话
Uh, I never spoke to him.

251
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,075
Austen告诉我的
Miss austen told me.

252
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,084
-你是否问过她她到底有罪没有?  -没有
Did you ever ask her if she was guilty? no. never.

253
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:05,001
似乎还是个合情理的问题  为什么
Well, it seems like a reasonable question. why not?

254
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,085
我觉得肯定是有一些误会
I just assumed that there'd been some kind of mistake.

255
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:11,002
你为什么这样认为
And why would you think that?

256
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,042
飞机坠毁后只有我们八人生还
Only eight of us survived the crash.

257
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,085
我们掉在水里
We landed in the water.

258
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:18,089
我伤得很重
I was hurt pretty badly.

259
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:21,075
事实上  要不是她的话
In fact, if it weren't for her,

260
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,025
我肯定上不了岸
I would have never made it to the shore.

261
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,052
她照顾我们  照顾我们所有人
She took care of me. she took care of all of us.

262
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:28,019
她给我们急救
She--she gave us first aid,

263
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:31,075
给我们找水和食物  建庇护所
Water, found food, made shelter.

264
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,071
她试图救另外两个  但是他们没有...
She tried to save the other two, but they didn't--

265
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,049
别说了
Stop.

266
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:38,092
Austen女士  请坐下
Miss austen, please sit down.

267
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:42,022
这和...和这些事没关系
This has nothing to do with... with anything.

268
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:45,079
这是我的审判
This is my trial,

269
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:48,005
我不想他说与此无关的事
And I don't want him to say anything else.

270
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,082
好了  我没有问题了  法官大人
It's fine. I have no more questions, your honor.

271
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,067
Dunbrook女士
Miss dunbrook,

272
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:56,032
到你发问
Your witness.

273
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:02,059
这真让人感动  Shephard医生
That was very moving, dr. shephard.

274
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,082
我只问你一个问题
I only have one question for you--

275
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:09,040
-你爱被告吗  -反对
Do you love the defendant? objection.

276
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,001
Forrester  是你开了先河
You opened this door, mr. forrester.

277
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,086
我允许问这个问题

278
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:17,044
Shephard医生
Dr. shephard?

279
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:21,019
你爱Austen女士吗

00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,053
不爱

281
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,016
不再爱了
Not anymore.

282
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,042
那么  你想看什么
So... what do you want to watch--

283
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,098
世外桃源或撒旦死亡记?
Xanadu or "satan's doom"?

284
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,054
我在看书
I'm reading.

285
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,085
把那玩意儿关小点  妈的
Turn that thing down, damn it.

286
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,093
抱歉

287
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:02,080

00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:13,073
你眼睛进东西了吗  Hugo
Got somethin' in your eye, hugo?

292
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:17,057
我们不如到厨房谈吧
Why don't we talk in the kitchen?

293
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,043
我知道尽管是在盒子里  但是
I know it's in a box, but, uh...

294
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:28,035
真的是他妈的好酒
It's pretty damn good wine.

295
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,002
我尝过了
I tested it.

296
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,012
和Claire住在一起感觉怎样
So how's the life at casa de claire?

297
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,071
Aaron是不是吵得你整夜睡不着?
Baby aaron keeping you up all night?

298
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:39,024
-不  他睡得很熟  -那很好啊
No. no, he's a good sleeper. good for you.

299
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:49,034
你真行  雀斑女
You are terrible at this, freckles.

300
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:53,048
你说过你不是为我而留下来的
You already said you didn't stay behind for me.

301
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,013
至少你得够女人味
So at least be woman enough

302
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,089
来告诉我你要利用我做什么
To tell me you wanna use me for somethin'.

303
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,030
我想你帮我
I wanna use you for somethin'.

304
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:07,002
瞧  没那么难吧
See? wasn't that hard.

305
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,012
干什么
For what?

306
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:11,065
把Ben弄出来
For ben.

307
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,075
我想你帮我把Ben弄出来
I want you to help me bust him out.

308
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,078
想玩玩西洋双陆棋吗
Wanna play some backgammon?

309
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,076
好啊
You're on.

310
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,054
我不确定自己的所作所为
Do you think I know what I'm doing?

311
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:40,059
你...
Do you...

312
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,090
后悔跟我一起到这儿?
Regret following me out here,

313
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,047
还是担心我们下一步该怎么走
Or are ya worried about what we should do next?

314
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,017
如果我在那岸边的话我会更担心
I'd be a lot more worried if I was sittin' on that beach.

315
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,021
剩下的那些人  他们在谈论什么
And the rest of the group-- what are they saying?

316
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:56,019
我想他们在谈论...(羊叫声)
I think they're saying, "baa."

317
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:59,085
关于绵羊的  这是件好事
That's the nice thing about sheep.

318
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:01,051
他们是这样预言的
They're predictable.

319
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:07,073
但是我不敢肯定Kate也这样想
But I ain't so sure about kate.

320
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,074
什么意思
What do you mean?

321
00:20:13,008 --> 00:20:16,001
我要你发誓你不会伤害她
I need your word you ain't gonna do nothin' to her.

322
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:19,028
-我为什么要伤害她  -你向我保证  John
Why would I do anything to her? just give me your word, john.

323
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,010
你知道吗  算了
You know what? forget it.

324
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,016
不  好吧
No, no. no. all right.

325
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,058
我向你保证
You have my word.

326
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:32,078
一个小时前她找到我
She came to me about an hour ago,

327
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:34,042
要我帮助她

把Ben从地下室弄出来
Busting ben out of your basement.

329
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:39,054
为什么
Why?

330
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:41,088
她和那家伙谈过了...
She talked to that guy...

331
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,081
就是从货船来的李小龙  你关着的那个
Bruce lee from the freighter- the guy you got locked up.

332
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:49,009
-他叫她把Ben带去和他谈谈  -不  不可能
He told her to bring ben down to him for a chat. no, that's impossible.

333
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,060
-她连Miles在哪都不知道  -什么
She doesn't even know where miles is. what?

334
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,047
他在去船坞的船库里
the boathouse down by the dock?

335
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,039
只要Hugo知道  大家都会知道
If hugo knows, everybody knows.

336
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:01,010
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

337
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,078
是的  我确定
Yeah, I'm sure.

338
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,016
你带那玩意儿要上哪去
Whoa, whoa, whoa. where you going with that?

339
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,062
不管Miles要对Ben说什么
Whatever miles has to say to ben,

340
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:13,006
他都可以和我说
He can say to me.

341
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,050
婊子养的
Son of a bitch.

342
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,026
快点
Come on.

343
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,057
一分钟  快点
You got one minute. go.

344
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:23,075
能不能单独谈
How about some privacy?

345
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,085
55秒
55 seconds.

346
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:29,083
你知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

347
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,031
你知道我为谁工作
You know who I work for?

348
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,044
对
Yes.

349
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:37,059
那么你也知道他花了很多时间和精力
Then you know he's put a lot of time and energy

350
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,046
来找你
Into finding you.

351
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:43,034
现在我找到你了
So now I found you,

352
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,067
我可以告诉他你到底在哪儿
And I can tell him exactly where you are.

353
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,034
或者我可以撒谎
Or I can lie

354
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:52,055
说你已经死了
And tell him you were already dead.

355

如果你愿给我320万

356
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,049
我很乐意说你死了
For $3.2 million.

357
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:05,026
你安排这次会面就是为了敲诈我吗?
You've arranged this meeting so you could blackmail me?

358
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,099
如果你认为是敲诈  那就是吧
It's extortion, if you wanna get technical.

359
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:11,036
320万  为什么不说330万或340万
3.2? well, why not 3.3 or 3.4?

360
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,039
是什么让你觉得我有那么多钱
What makes you think I have access to that kind of money?

361
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,022
不要以为我是他们中一员
Do not treat me like I'm one of them,

362
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:24,069
不要认为我不知道你是谁和你的能力
Like I don't know who you are and what you can do.

363
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:28,000
你的朋友Charlotte来见过我
Your friend charlotte has seen me.

364
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,030
她知道我还活着  我会照顾好Charlotte

365
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,026
你就只管担心给我凑钱吧
You just worry about getting me the money.

366
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:33,065
你有两天时间
You have two days.

367
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:35,092
我目前的情形有点糟糕
My present situation is a little bit restricted.

368
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:39,010
-可不可以在缓点  -好

-一星期  我要现金  -时间到了
One week, in cash. time's up.

370
00:23:42,057 --> 00:23:43,058
想都别想
Don't even think about--

371
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:45,076
我说时间到了
I said time's up!

372
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:50,005
你这样让我激动
Ooh, this is hot.

373
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:52,063
你已见到他了  现在我要我的答案
You got your meeting. now I want my answer.

374
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:57,078

We got your name when you called the freighter.

375
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,014
当然  我们知道你的一切
Of course, we know about you

And everybody else on the 815 manifest. then prove it.

377
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:05,076
你叫Katherine Anne Austen
Your name is katherine anne austen.

378
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:08,049
因谋杀  敲诈  纵火而被逮捕
You're wanted for murder, fraud, arson,

379
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:11,002
其他事我也记不清了
A whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember.

380
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:14,005
你是个逃亡者  在澳大利亚被抓
You're a fugitive, got caught in australia,

381
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:16,029
联邦调查人员把你逮捕归案
And the feds are bringing you back.

382
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,075
是的  我们都知道
So, yeah, we know.

383
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,081
如果我是你  我就会呆在这岛上
If I were you, I'd stay right here on the island.

384
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:28,051
这样谁也不知道  别人可能以为你在坠毁中死了
Who knows? maybe you didn't survive the crash.

385
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,088
走吧
Come on.

386
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,035
快回去  Kate
Go back to your house, kate.

387
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:45,017
-John  这和你没关系  -滚回去  Kate!  
John, this has nothing to do with you- go back to your house, kate!

388
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,041
你还好吗?
Hey. you okay?

389
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:13,012
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep.

390
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:16,032
我们是要花点时间去习惯睡这床
Yeah. the beds take a little getting used to.

391
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,046
我没吵醒Aaron吧?
I didn't wake aaron, did i?

392
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:20,052
没有  Aaron是在这岛上出生的
No, aaron was born on this island.

393
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,019
他不管怎样也能睡着

394
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:25,016
John?
John?

395
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:28,028
你来有事吗?
What are you doing?

396
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:31,026
我想和Kate单独呆会儿
I'd like a... a moment alone with kate.

397
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:33,038
可以吗  Claire
Would you excuse us, please, claire?

398
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:36,071
没事
It's okay.

399
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:45,097
我不想知道你为什么这样做
I don't need to know why you did what you did.

400
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:49,098
Kate  我只想知道他们说了什么
Kate, I just need to know what they said to each other.

401
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:53,088
Miles告诉Ben
Miles told ben that he would lie

402
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:56,062
他会向他船上的老板撒谎
To the people he works for on the boat,

403
00:25:56,062 --> 00:26:00,056
只要拿到320万  他就告诉他们Ben已经死了
Tell them that ben was dead, for $3.2 million.

404
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,081
John  我很抱歉
Listen, john, I'm sorry.

405
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,028
我问过你他在哪
I asked you where he was-

406
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:11,019
你不能再呆在这儿了
You're not welcome here anymore.

407
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,066
我希望你明早就走
I want you gone by morning.

408
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,074
我想你们俩该单独谈谈
I worked it out so you two can have a few minutes of privacy.

409
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:42,072
我不想和她谈
i don't need any privacy.

410
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:44,081
你应该和她谈谈  Kate
You need to talk to her, kate.

411
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:47,086
我会在外面
I'll be outside.

412
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,057
你好  Katherine
Hello, katherine.

413
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:03,087
Shephard医生说的是真的吗?
Was it true, what he said?

414
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:09,030
他说你是个英雄
Dr. shephard-- that you're a hero.

415
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:20,066
你为什么不理我? 
Why won't you talk to me?

416
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:24,027
因为,妈妈上次你病了,我试着和你交谈
Because, mom, the last time I tried to talk to you, when you got sick,

417
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:25,076
我冒险去看你
When I risked my life to see you,

418
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,090
-你却大叫救命还打电话给警察  -求你了
You screamed for help and called the police. please.

419
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:35,022
我不想和你吵  Katherine
I don't want to fight with you, katherine.

420
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,013
你为什么来这?
Why are you here?

421
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:44,001
因为...
Because...

422
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:46,096
我...
I...

423
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:53,025
一切都变了
It all changed

424
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:55,096
我那时以为你已经死了
When I thought you were dead.

425
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:05,028
医生说我只能活六个月
My doctors have given me six months to live

426
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:08,033
在过去四年里
For the last four years.

427
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:11,087
我不知道自己还能活多久
I don't know how long I'm going to last.

428
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:14,084
我来是想告诉你  我...
I came here to tell you that i...

429
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:18,093
我不想指证你
I don't want to testify against you.

430
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:30,019
那就不要
Then don't.

431
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:37,053
我想见见我孙子
I want to see my grandson.

432
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:47,062
你来这和我谈条件?
You came here to make a deal?

433
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:50,014
我只是想见见他
I just wanna meet him.

434
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:53,044
我不想你接近他
I don't want you anywhere near him.

435
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,098
我们说完了
We're finished.

436
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:02,064
我们说完了!
We're finished!

437
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:09,024
嘿  雀斑女
Oh, hey, freckles.

438
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,042
你还好吧?
You okay?

439
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:24,039
对不起  我不能坐视不管
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't do nothin'.

440
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,063
我想让他觉得你也耍了我 
I wanted him to think that you fooled me, too.

441
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:32,039
他相信我们俩
No sense in him not trusting both of us.

442
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:37,071
他让我在明天前离开
He wants me gone by tomorrow.

443
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:41,016
什么  他...赶你走?
What, he... banished you?

444
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:44,090
呃  我不会赶你走
Well, I un-banish you.

445
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:49,086
你可以呆在...
You can stay right...

446
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:51,066
这儿
Here.

447
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:54,035
这是我的屋子
This is my house.

448
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:01,097
好吧  是我和Montezuma的房间

你一定会没事的
You're gonna be all right.

450
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,074
我会保护你
I'll keep you safe.

451
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,091
时间到  好了  告诉我

453
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:39,018
好  呃  方块Q

我们还有十...
And we have the red 10 of...

458
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:54,095
红心  对吧?
Hearts, maybe?

459
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:03,085
对了两个
It's two out of three.

460
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:06,045
还不错
It's not bad.

461
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:07,069
有进步
It's progress.

463

算是进步吗?
Is that progress? hey.

464
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:18,035
呼叫了一天了  你的船上怎么没人应答?
Been calling your boat all day. why isn't anyone answering?

465
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:20,051
我们俩在这  我们怎么知道?
We're here. how should we know?

466
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:21,074
如果没人应答  那他们可能已经...  -你不会是想告诉我
If they're not answering, then they're probably-- now are you telling me

467
00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:24,057
你的船上只有一条通信线路吧?
There is only one line on that boat?

468
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:28,032
还有一个通信号码
There is another number

469
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:30,089
是为紧急情况准备的

471
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:45,084
放在免提上
Put it on speaker.

472
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:57,064

474
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:04,003
-你怎么用这个号打过来?  -Minkowski没接
Why are you calling me on this number? minkowski wasn't answering.

475
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,050
岛上的人想和他们的朋友通话
The people on the island want to talk to their friends,

476
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,090
从而确定他们安全
Make sure they're all right.

477
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,082
什么...朋友?
What...friends?

478
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:13,053
他们昨晚离开了这里

479
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:15,052
Frank开着直升机接走了他们
Frank took 'em up in the helicopter.

480
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:17,042
什么意思  开直升机接他们?
What do you mean, they took off?

481
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:20,019
我以为直升机一直在你们那
I thought the helicopter was with you.

482
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,018
早安
Morning.

483
00:32:44,072 --> 00:32:48,057
听着  我不知道你在干嘛
Listen, I don't know what you think you're doing,

484
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:50,053
你只是在浪费你的时间  张嘴
But you're wasting your time. open your mouth.

485
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:53,033
张嘴  大一点
Open your mouth. wide.

486
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,048
呃...
Uh...

00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:56,058
别出声  咬住  咬住
Don't talk. bite down. bite down.

488
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:00,086
我觉得我那天把你捆起来的时候
I realize that when I tied you up in here the other day,

489
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:03,030
没能好好介绍自己
I made the mistake of failing to introduce myself.

490
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,016
我叫John Locke
My name is john locke,

491
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,030
维护这个岛的安宁
And I'm responsible for the well-being of this island.

492
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,063
最终  Miles  你会告诉我你是谁
Eventually, miles, you're gonna tell me who you are

493
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:12,071
还会告诉我船上那些人的情况
And you're gonna tell me about the people on the boat

494
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:15,091
还有你们为什么对Ben那么感兴趣
And you're gonna tell me why you're so interested in ben.

495
00:33:16,002 --> 00:33:17,097
但是现在
In the meantime, however,

496
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:20,083
你的把嘴闭紧
You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

497
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,013
昨天我学到
I learned something yesterday.

498
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:28,087
如果没有惩罚  规矩就没用
No use having rules if there's no punishment for breaking 'em.

499
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:32,068
你咬住触发器就不会有事
You'll be fine if you bite down on the trigger.

500
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:35,089
享受你的早餐吧

来吧
Oh, come on.

503
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,086
又不是没这么干过
It's not like we ain't never done it before.

504
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:20,026
昨晚我们没离开可真好
Yeah,I'm cool we didn't go all the way last night.

505
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:23,046
知道了  你很难过
I get it. you were sad.

506
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:25,022
但我想说
But, I mean,

507
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,061
你又怎么能抗拒那句
How can you resist after that whole,

508
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:29,071
让我保护你呢？
I'll keep you safe thing?

509
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:32,025

00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:33,075
只是什么?
What?

511
00:34:35,094 --> 00:34:38,049
只是...算了
Just... forget it.

512
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:41,019
好吧
Oh, right.

513
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:44,083
你仍然觉得你可能怀孕了
You still think you might be pregnant.

514
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,088
我不担心
I'm not worried.

515
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:55,083
而且我没怀孕
And I'm not pregnant.

516
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,088
你确定?
Are you sure?

517
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:01,033
是的  是真的
Yeah, I'm sure.

518
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:02,098
哈哈!
Ha ha!

519
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:04,030
我是说...
I mean...

520
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:08,000
如果那样会是最糟的吗?
Would it have been the worst thing in the world?

521
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,058
会啊!当然  那将是世界上最糟糕的事
Yes! yes,it would've been the worst thing in the world.

522
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,059
我们有了孩子该怎么办?
What would we have done with a baby?

523
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,088
我要回海滩去
I'm going back to the beach.

524
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:20,006
海滩?怎么  因为这个你就要走?
Beach? what, you're leavin' because of this?

525
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:22,076
就这样了?你跟我上床
That's that? you crawl up in my bed one second,

526
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:25,004
-紧接着  你就要  -再见
The next, you're just-- good-bye.

527
00:35:26,072 --> 00:35:28,055
别拿我出气  Kate
Don't make this about me, kate.

528
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:30,087
你并不是比我更想要个孩子
You didn't want a baby any more than I did.

529
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:33,048
你不过是想找个理由离开
You're just lookin' for some excuse to split,

530
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,018
现在你找到了一个

531
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,074
那么好吧  雀斑女
Well,that's all right,freckles.

532
00:35:37,074 --> 00:35:40,006
我不跟你吵
I ain't gonna hold it against ya.

533
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,011
我只会呆在这  在我舒适的床上
I'm just gonna sit right here in my comfy bed,

534
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,089
因为只消大概一周

535
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:47,025
你就会找个理由和Jack闹翻
You'll find some reason to get pissed at jack

536
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:49,038
然后回到我身边
And bounce right back to me.

537
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:15,081

Good. all right.

- I want you to find out where she - miss dunbrook.

541

可以继续了吗？
Are the people ready to proceed?

542
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:27,080
法官大人  我们想近前谈话
May we approach the bench, your honor?

543
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,059
好吧
Oh. please.

544
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,039
不幸的是  法官大人
Unfortunately, your honor,

545
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:39,066
我们的主要证人  Diane Jansen  被告的母亲
Our chief witness, diane jansen, the mother of the defendant,

546
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,056
由于某些健康原因不能出庭作证

547
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:44,069

548
00:36:45,063 --> 00:36:47,001
现在我还说不准
I can't say right now.

549
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:48,078
我将休庭至午饭时
What I'll do is grant a recess for lunch,

550
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:52,087
但在我们开庭时请你准备好继续你的案子
But be prepared to proceed with your case after we return.

551
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:55,050
现在休庭
This court is now in recess.

552
00:36:55,053 --> 00:36:57,058
起立
All rise.

553
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,083
我们得谈谈

554
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:08,051
我的主要证人昨天和她的女儿交谈
My key witness spoke to her daughter yesterday,

555
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:10,022
而现在她却退却了
And now she's got cold feet.

556
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:12,043
装的挺像  那我们就商量商量
Quit posturing, and let's get to it.

557
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,011

四年监禁
Four years in.

559
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,034
不能有监禁

560
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,098
Kate Austen是全世界的英雄

561
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:25,084
她在坠机事件中救了五条命

在一个废弃的岛上差点饿死

563
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:30,093
而在这些之后  你把她告上法庭
And after all that, you put this woman on trial

564
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:34,020
仅因为她想把她妈妈从施虐狂丈夫手中救出
For rescuing her mother from an abusive husband.

565
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:39,055
如果你认为陪审团会给她监禁
If you think that jury is gonna give her actual time, then...

566
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:42,052
你也太天真了  Melissa
You must have a hell of a closing, melissa.

567
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,068
好吧

568
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:50,021
监禁时间不变  加上十年缓刑期
Time served, plus 10 years' probation

569
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:54,058
-而且必须保证她不能离开美国  -那有什么关系?
And agreement that she does not leave the state. what does that matter?

570
00:37:54,058 --> 00:37:56,059
-她能去任何地...  -我接受
She can go anyw-- I'll take it.

571
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,075
-不  等等  Kate  -给我个协议  我会签
No. wait, kate-- give me something to sign, and I'll sign it,

572
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:01,099
然后我走出后门
And then I walk out the back door.

573
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,083
我只是...

574
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:08,094
我只是想这一切结束
I just want this to be over.

575
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:12,013
好吧

576
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:15,079
十年缓刑  你呆在这
10 years' probation, and you stay put.

577
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,032
我有个小孩

578
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:22,051
我哪都不会去
I'm not going anywhere.

579
00:38:36,098 --> 00:38:37,092
嘿
Hey.

580
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,008
你怎么知道我会来这?
How did you know I'd be here?

581
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:50,035
你的律师给了我提示

582

You know, jack, I've heard you say that story so many times,

587
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,064
我觉得你开始相信了
I'm starting to think you believe it.

588
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:13,035
我只想-
I just--

589
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:16,067
我只想告诉你  我在那所说的...
I just wanted to tell you that what I said in there...

590
00:39:19,077 --> 00:39:21,027
都不是我的本意
I didn't mean it.

591
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:30,042
你能跟我来?
You wanna follow me?

592
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,050

可以一起喝杯咖啡？

597
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:54,009
我知道你为什么不想看到孩子  Jack
I know why you don't wanna see the baby, jack.

598
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:57,093
但直到你想
But until you do,

599
00:39:58,057 --> 00:40:00,057
直到你想见...
Until you want to...
