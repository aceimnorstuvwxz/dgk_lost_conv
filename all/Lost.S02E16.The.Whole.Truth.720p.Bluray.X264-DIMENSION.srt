00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:18,052
他是他们的一员
He is one of them.

6
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:27,076
她很好  她会没事的
She's okay. She's gonna be all right.

7
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,013
-你在哪儿找到她的?  -在她菜园边上
-Where did you find her?  -Just outside our garden.

8
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:42,047
快上床吧

9
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:45,078
马上来了

10
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:56,026
你看起来很美

11
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,012
噢  真是的

12
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:02,018
转个身吧

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,098
亲爱的...

14
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:08,000
来吧...

15
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,005
你量过体温了吗?

16
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,084
真不浪漫

17
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,003
对不起

18
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:46,053
只是...已经一年了

19
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,050
我想我们还是去看下医生吧

20
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:54,087
看医生?

21
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,088
产科医生

22
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:03,064
你为什么这么在意那个  你也许见都见不到的孩子?

23
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:06,040
不要指责我的工作  Sun 我努力干我们才...

24
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:07,089
工作?

25
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,086
当你满手是血的回家  这不叫工作

26
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:14,071
那你想想我为什么满手是血的回家?

27
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:20,081
都是因为你父亲  是他让我做的

28
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:35,020
我不是故意的...我很抱歉

29
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,085
也许等我们有了孩子后...

30
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:44,096
你父亲会改变他的主意

31
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:48,080
我们给他生个孙子

32
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:52,091
他也许会给我个安全点的活干

33
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:04,099
孩子可以改变一切

34
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:12,099
会让生活变得更好

35
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,046
Jin...吓了我一跳

36
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:39,051
你知道我找了你多久么? 你在这儿干什么?

37
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:44,008
你说什么啊?  我在菜园里干活啊

38
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,005
来吧  我们回去

39
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,039
什么?  不要

40
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:49,064
走吧  我们现在就回去

41
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:52,002
你还想再被劫么?

42
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:53,083
什么?

43
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:56,006
你在这儿被其他人袭击过

44
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:59,020
我们说过这事了  跟我走

45
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:02,064
我不需要你保护我

46
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:07,080
我只是在我的菜园里干活

47
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:12,047
什么?  我的菜园?

48
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,054
停下  拜托  住手

49
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:24,068
现在你没理由来这儿了吧

50
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,041
可以回去了么?

51
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:11,094
跑得这么快  后面有鬼追你么?
You were running like the devil's chasing you.

52
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:16,028
也许是吧
Maybe he is.

53
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:20,018
对你保持身材有好处
Good for you, keeping in shape.

54
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:22,001
你想要干吗  Locke?
What do you want, Locke?

55
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,064
我要干吗?
What do I want?

56
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,068
我在这儿一个多星期了
I've been here over a week.

57
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:28,076
你从没和我说过什么话
You've never said two words to me,

58
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:31,040
现在你却坐在我帐篷外面
and now you're sitting outside my tent?

59
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:35,015
舱子里关着一个人
We got a man locked up down in the hatch.

60
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,065
有可能是他们中的一个...其他人
There's a possibility he's one of them...the others.

61
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,086
他现在在看着他
He's keeping watch right now.

62
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:44,084
-我们是谁?  -我和Jack  
-Who's we?  -Me and Jack.

63
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,052
他被关多久了?
How long has he been down there?

64
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,033
三天
Three days.

65
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,072
我想让你和他谈谈
I'd like you to talk with him.

66
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,090
你有和其他人接触过的经验  你曾经是个警察
You have experience with the others. You were a cop.

67
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,098
对我来说你是最好的人选  去辨别一下
Seems to me you're the most qualified to figure out

68
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:01,079
这个人说的是否是真话
if this man's telling the truth.

69
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,055
Jack知道你为这事来找我么?
Does jack know you're coming to me with this?

70
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:13,023
我们大家有个大问题  Ana Lucia...我们大家
We got a serious problem, Ana Lucia...all of us.

71
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:18,010
我只是为了能解决它
I'm taking the necessary steps to solve it.

72
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:20,092
和你谈话我不需要Jack的允许 因为现在
I don't need Jack's permission to talk with you, because right now,

73
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:26,006
在舱里有个人  我想放他出来
there's a man sitting in a room in my hatch, and I want him out.

74
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,072
我不需要你给什么
I don't wanna give you anything.

75
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,051
只要想想就好了  但你没去想
It's the thought that counts,and you just didn't think.

76
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,090
我整天在想
I think all the time.

77
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,073
也许你该让我在这儿歇一会儿
Maybe you should think about giving me a little bit of a break here.

78
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:49,037
别说了  Bernard  别说了
Oh,  just hush, Bernard. Just hush.

79
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:53,048
亲爱的?  你没事吧?
Honey? Are you all right?

80
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:58,080
我...我想我只是有点头晕
I'm... I think I'm just a little lightheaded.

81
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:00,068
你脸色像纸一样苍白
Well, you look as pale as a sheet.

82
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,081
快给她点水喝
Well, give her some water.

83
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:04,036
好的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,071
别理他  亲爱的  他疯了
Don't pay him any mind, honey.

85
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:10,006
他居然忘了我的生日
He's just mad at the world because he forgot my birthday.

86
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,069
我没忘  我只是不知道 今天到底是星期几  Rose
I didn't forget. I don't even know what day of the week it is, Rose.

87
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:15,074
星期六  Bernard 
It's saturday,Bernard.

88
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:17,043
亲爱的  你还能走么? 
Can you walk, honey?

89
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:19,044
可以  我还好 
Really, I'm all right.

90
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,082
-也许我们得叫Jin来  -不 
-Maybe  we should go get jin.  -No!

91
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,028
我想我只是太阳晒多了 
I think I was just out in the sun too long.

92
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:29,062
你整天和孩子呆在一起 
Well, you spend a lot of time around the baby.

93
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,060
也许得了什么病  至少问问Jack 
Maybe you caught something. At least talk to Jack.

94
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:37,084
真的不用了  我很好 谢谢你们两个 
Really,I'm okay. Thank you, both of you.

95
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,075
路上很堵么?

96
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,099
和往常一样

97
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,089
他知道你在这吗?

98
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:25,040
不知道

99
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,013
我以为你会告诉他

100
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:30,006
不可能的

101
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:41,070
你今天能抽空过来我很高兴

102
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:47,002
这是作为经理和酒店老板 的独子的难得空闲啊

103
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:49,009
可自由支配的时间

104
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:51,072
房间也不是太旧

105
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:54,086
要喝点什么吗?

106
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,038
请来杯冰茶吧

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,018
用英语怎么说? 
In english?

108
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:10,049
我...我想要杯冰茶 
I'll...hmm...I would like an iced tea. Please.

109
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:13,036
谢谢 
Thank you.

110
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:18,075
你还好吧?

111
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,024
我很好

112
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:23,000
要谈谈那件事么?

113
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:25,041
不用了

114
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:28,069
如果你改变主意的话...

115
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:32,012
可以不用接受我的建议

116
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:37,062
不过你会说英文Jin一定会很高兴的

117
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:44,048
但他问起我是怎么学  向谁学时 我该怎么说呢

118
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:48,041
如果你觉得我们这样会面有问题 就不用继续下去了

119
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:53,045
-这是你希望的么?  -不是

120
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:01,039
我也能练练英语

121
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:14,079
早上好  
Jack Morning, Jack.

122
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:19,078
你就不能等我洗完再进来么? 
You couldn't wait until I was done in here?

123
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,073
蒸汽使我毛孔扩张 
The steam opens up my pores.

124
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,067
我们没有剃须沫  得随时等机会 
Man's got no shaving cream, he's got to improvise.

125
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:29,001
我想现在就是个好时候了 
I also thought this might be a good time

126
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,076
来谈谈我们的问题 
to talk about our problem.

127
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,071
我们的问题 
Our problem.

128
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,099
Henry的问题  我们已经关了他三天了 
Our Henry problem. We've had him locked up for three days now,

129
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,025
我爱莫能助  只是觉得我们 
and I can't help but get the sense that he's just not

130
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:41,019
无法让他和我们合作 
motivated to cooperate with us.

131
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,037
那我们可以有什么办法呢  John
John? And how are we gonna motivate him,John?

132
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,069
我想我们是没办法了 
I don't think there's anything we can do.

133
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:48,003
我们得试试别人 
I think we need to bring in some new blood.

134
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:50,036
很明显你有人选了
Obviously you have someone in mind.

135
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:52,096
你看Ana Lucia怎么样? 
What do you think about Ana Lucia?

136
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,026
为什么是她? 
Why her?

137
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:59,041
你要建军队和那些人战斗时  她是你找的人 
She's the one you went to to start an army to fight these people.

138
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,000
那为什么不是她? 
Why not her?

139
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:04,059
除非你担心她会对他做什么 
Unless you're worried about what she'll do to him.

140
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:09,004
我去和她谈谈 
I'll talk to her.

141
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,030
我谈过了 
I already did.

142
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,020
她已经在房间里了 
She's in there with him now.

143
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:22,071
你也是飞机上的么? 
Were you on the plane,too?

144
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,078
我在尾部 
I was in the tail section.

145
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:30,002
我们坠落在岛的另一边 
We crashed on the other side of the island.

146
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,045
你是穿过整个岛过来的? 
You walked across? All the way here?

147
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,050
一定很有趣吧 
That must have been fun.

148
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:39,058
有时是的 
It had its moments.

149
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:43,054
那么你来讲讲你的故事吧  Henry
Henry So are you gonna tell me your story, Henry?

150
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:47,004
Jack  Locke为什么烦恼?  我已经和所有人说过了 
Jack  Locke Why bother? I've already told it to everyone

151
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:49,069
Jack  Locke  那个在我面前割胡须的黑大个 
Jack, Locke, the big black guy that cut off his beard in front of me.

152
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,092
噢  还有我的伙伴Sayid
Oh, yeah, and my buddy Sayid.

153
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:54,030
看看我的脸就知道他有多喜欢我的故事了
You can see how much he liked my story.

154
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,022
那么为什么不和我说说?
So how about you try me?

155
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,080
我不是不领情  但是...
I don't mean to be ungrateful, but...

156
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:02,015
你为什么要帮我离开这儿?
why are you gonna help me get out of here?

157
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,040
在岛的另一边
On the other side of the island,

158
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:06,055
有这么个人和我们一起
there was this guy with us.

159
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:10,021
我百分百肯定他不是飞机上的
I was 100% convinced that he wasn't on the plane.

160
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:15,016
所以我挖了个洞  把他扔了进去
So I dug a hole, and I threw him in it.

161
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,066
然后呢?
And what happened?

162
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,009
是我错了  现在他死了
I was wrong. And now he's dead.

163
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,093
但是有个好消息  Henry 我不会两次犯同样的错误
But good news for you, Henry...I don't make the same mistake twice.

164
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:34,030
所以你最好和我说说你的故事
So how about you tell me your story?

165
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:43,086
Sawyer?

166
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:49,088
噢  好啊  有事么?
Well, hey there, sunshine. What can I do for you?

167
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,072
这本书怎样?
How's your book?

168
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:56,070
情节猜都猜得到 性描写也不多
Predictable.Not nearly enough sex.

169
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,084
我听说药物供给都在你那儿
I heard that you have all the, uh, medical supplies.

170
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:10,086
是的
You heard correct.

171
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:12,052
我能看看有什么吗?
May I look through them?

172
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,008
不可以
No,

173
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:17,017
但是如果你告诉我你要找什么...
you may not. But if you'll tell me what you're lookin' for...

174
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,090
算了
Forget it.

175
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:23,024
好了  等等
Okay, hold on.

176
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,090
现在我很感兴趣
Now I'm intrigued.

177
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,039
告诉你...
Tell you what...

178
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,023
我和你说  告诉我你想找什么 我就白送给你
tell me what you're lookin' for, and it's yours. Gratis.

179
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:32,060
我就不能自己找么?
Can't I just look myself?

180
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:35,076
亲爱的  这可不是在药房里
It's not a drugstore, sweetheart.

181
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:48,086
我要...一根测孕棒
I need...a pregnancy test.

182
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,038
我什么都听不到
I can't hear anything.

183
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,090
她才进去了三十分钟
She's only been in there about 30 minutes.

184
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,094
你怎么知道他没有扭Ana的脖子  John?
How do you know he hasn't snapped her neck, John?

185
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:10,083
那你怎么知道Ana没有扭他的脖子?
How do you know she hasn't snapped his?

186
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,041
那么我就直说了
So let me get this straight

187
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,023
你们夫妻乘一个有笑脸的热气球环球旅行坠毁在这 
you and your wife travel around the world and crash here in a smiley face balloon.

188
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:19,063
然后她死了
Then she dies.

189
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:22,038
你被一个法国人抓了  并被她带来这里
You get captured by a french chick who brings you here,

190
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,048
你这么说听起来有点傻  然后他们把你关了起来
Sounds kind of silly when you say it like that. and then they lock you up.

191
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,084
你为什么没胡须?
Why don't you have a beard?

192
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:30,065
因为我刮过
Because I shaved.

193
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:34,021
这些平常人做的事情我也需要
Because I needed something normal.

194
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,054
好的
Okay.

195
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:39,082
那么你为什么不画一张去热气球那儿的地图呢?
So why don't you draw me a map to your balloon?

196
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:41,069
我们去那儿找到的话
We'll go out there. We'll find it,

197
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,025
大家就会相信你了
and everybody will believe you.

198
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:46,001
他们一直要我画...画一张地图
That's what they all keep asking me to do...draw a map.

199
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:48,008
但如果我画错了  他们就会把我钉死在十字架上
And if I mess up, they'll crucify me.

200
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:50,058
你可以乘热气球环球旅行
You flew around the world in a balloon.

201
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:52,075
但却怕画不好地图?
And you don't think you can draw up a good map?

202
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:56,097
飞行...完全是两码事 这是有关于气流的...
Air travel...it's a different animal. It's about wind currents--

203
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,099
你到底知不知道它在哪儿?
Do you or do you not know where it is?

204
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,065
当然  我知道
Yeah, I know where it is.

205
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,033
我就在那儿埋了我的妻子
I went back there to bury my wife.

206
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,084
你为什么那么做?
Why did you do that?

207
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:18,052
因为那只热气球是我们最有家乡味的东西
Because that balloon was the closest thing we had to home.

208
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:25,041
你们一直在为了所发生的事
You people have been looking for someone to punish for everything that's happened to you--

209
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:30,005
找人顶罪  现在你们总算找到了
someone to blame. And now you've got him.

210
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:35,012
不管我做了什么  我是死定了
Doesn't matter what I do. I'm dead already.

211
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:44,018
你画好地图  Henry  我会找到你的热气球的
You draw up that map, henry. I'll find your balloon.

212
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:47,091
但如果你不画...
But if you don't...

213
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,092
你就真的死定了
things are gonna play out just like you said.

214
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:17,069
嘿  Sun
Hey, sun.

215
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:23,049
看看我在从林里找到的
Look what I found in the middle of the jungle.

216
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:27,011
一点都没有化掉  很奇怪  不是么?
It's not even melted or nothing. Crazy, huh?

217
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,007
要分一小块么?
You want to split it?

218
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,056
不了  不了  谢谢
no, no, thanks

219
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:40,027
我正要去海滩那儿
I was just heading to the beach.

220
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:45,049
好的  恩  再见  伙计
Okay. Well, later, dude.

221
00:17:06,037 --> 00:17:10,014
你们好  Kwan先生  Kwan太太

222
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,034
你好

223
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:13,089
对不起让你们久等了

224
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,021
你爸爸最近好吗?

225
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,085
他很好  谢谢关心

226
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:20,039
帮我问候一下他吧

227
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:25,006
当然  也再次谢谢你

228
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:28,083
医生  有结果了么?

229
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:37,035
恐怕...是个坏消息

230
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:46,044
超声波显示子宫内膜异位  疤痕组织堵塞了输卵管

231
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,056
也就是说...

232
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:58,067
就算做了手术  怀孕也是不可能的

233
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,079
你能治好么?  你肯定可以做点什么

234
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:13,034
我无能为力  很抱歉

235
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:22,004
我们结婚之前你知道这个吗?

236
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,019
什么?

237
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:27,049
你一定有企图

238
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:30,060
我为什么要对你隐瞒?

239
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:37,023
噢  是啊  我要诱拐一个渔民的儿子

240
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:54,088
我要出来了
I need out.

241
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:15,063
他和我说的同和你们说的一样
He told me the same story he told you.

242
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,078
你相信他?
You believe him?

243
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,038
我还不知道  我需要再和他呆段时间
I don't know yet.I need more time with him.

244
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,053
随时都可以
He's all yours.

245
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:25,084
就明天  我给他点时间考虑
Tomorrow. I want to give him some time to think.

246
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:31,043
你同意吧?
That's okay with you?

247
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:35,035
我没和任何人说起过  Ana
I didn't tell anyone, Ana.

248
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,041
这你不用担心
No worries, man.

249
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,088
大得可以放下一张餐桌了  不是么?
Bit large for a dining room table, isn't it?

250
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,065
我们把他截成两半就行了
We cut them in two, it will suit the purpose.

251
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:56,005
Sayid

252
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,025
Sayid  能和你谈谈么?
Sayid, can I talk to you?

253
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,016
当然
Of course.

254
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,059
单独谈谈
Alone.

255
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:10,080
不管你要说什么  你可以在这儿说
Whatever you need to say, you can say it here.

256
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,073
是和舱子有关的
It's about the hatch.

257
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:15,041
噢  你是指那个被锁在储藏室里的人么?
Oh, you mean the guy locked in the closet there?

258
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,068
他怎么了?
What about him?

259
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:32,050
是去他热气球那儿的
It's to his balloon.

260
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:35,030
你怎么做到的?
How did you get him to do this?

261
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,036
我用软的
I asked nicely.

262
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:41,035
Jack和Locke知道这张图么?
Do Jack and Locke know about this?

263
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:45,001
Jack和Locke正忙于互相担心
Jack  and Locke are a little too busy worrying about Locke and Jack.

264
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:51,023
我想知道这家伙是不是在说真的
All I want to know is if this guy's telling the truth.

265
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:52,076
为什么来找我?
Why come to me?

266
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:56,038
从他脸上的伤痕来看  你对这个也有兴趣
Judging from what you did to his face, that's what you want, too.

267
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,052
去那儿至少要走一天
This is at least a day's walk.

268
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,046
那我们就马上动身
Then we should get going.

269
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:27,060
你没事吧?
You okay?

270
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:29,090
没事  谢谢
Fine. Thank you.

271
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:45,003
那儿的岩壁就是这个了
That cliff there appears to be this.

272
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,074
到这儿为止Henry还是老实的
Score one for Henry.

273
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:48,027
仅仅标明一个地理标志
Pointing out a geographical touchstone

274
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:50,065
不代表他会把我们引向他的热气球
does not mean he's leading us to a balloon.

275
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:53,051
也许不会  但至少我们没有走错岛
Maybe not, but at least we're on the right island.

276
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,090
幽默感不适合他
Humor's not his strong suit.

277
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:03,082
这句话是对你说的
And I'm saying this to you.

278
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,097
你在看我的屁股?
You looking at my bum?

279
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:18,033
不是  我在看你的枪
No, I'm looking at your gun.

280
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:20,007
我的什么?
My what?

281
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:23,064
也许你该把枪给会用的人
Maybe you should give the gun to somebody who knows how to use it.

282
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:29,018
我会的  我记得你上次持枪时 有人被你谋杀了
Maybe I will. As I recall, the last time you had a gun, you murdered someone.

283
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,067
够了
That's enough.

284
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,094
我们要走到岩壁脚下  在那儿露营
We'll go as far as the base of the cliff, and we'll camp there.

285
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:56,070
大概要多久?
How long is it supposed to take?

286
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:59,053
要两分钟
Uh, up to two minutes.

287
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:08,064
-我很抱歉  我只是...  -我知道
-I'm sorry. I'm just...  -I know.

288
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,081
Sawyer是从哪儿找到这个的?
Where did sawyer find one of these, anyway?

289
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:16,073
我是说  谁会带着测孕棒坐飞机  对么?
I mean, who flies with a pregnancy test, right?

290
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:21,097
你有用过么?
Have you ever taken one?

291
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,064
恩
Yeah.

292
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,064
谢谢你陪着我...
Thank you for waiting with me...

293
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:36,082
并且没有问为什么是你而不是Jin陪我

294
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,024
不客气
You're welcome.

295
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,046
时间到了
It's time.

296
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:04,040
你怀孕了
You're pregnant.

297
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:12,058
是百分百正确么?
Is it 100% sure?

298
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:15,047
只有一个人能回答
There's only one way to find out.

299
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:19,091
这些测孕棒是很精确的
These tests are pretty accurate.

300
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:23,019
你知道  可能在第一周会出现错误的阴性
You know, false negative in the first week maybe,

301
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,010
但阳性就是阳性
but a positive is a positive.

302
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:28,040
但那是不可能的
But it's impossible.

303
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:30,036
噢  不  这是可能的
Oh, no. It's possible.

304
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:33,045
你感到走路不稳?  头很轻?
You feeling queasy? Light-headed?

305
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:37,060
拜托  Jack  这是私事   不要告诉任何人
Please, Jack. This is private. Nobody can know.

306
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:40,024
你不准备告诉Jin?
You're not gonna tell Jin?

307
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:42,089
合适时我会的  只是...
In time, I will. It's just...

308
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:47,011
这很复杂
it's complicated.

309
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:51,035
就像Jin是这个岛上最后一个知道 你会说英语的人?
As complicated as Jin being the last one on the island to find out you spoke english?

310
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:56,040
Sun  我建议...只是个建议 因为我是最后一个这么说的
Sun, my advice...and it's just that, because I'm the last person to ask about this,

311
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:59,076
你应该告诉他
but you should tell him.

312
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:03,011
而且你得把你所有的事都告诉他...所有真相
And when you do, you should tell him everything...the whole truth.

313
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,076
我得回去舱里了
I'm gonna get back to the hatch.

314
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,074
恭喜你  Sun
Congratulations, Sun.

315
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:17,055
你经常去那儿  Jack  没什么事吧?
You've been down there a lot, Jack. Is everything okay?

316
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:22,007
当然  一切都好
Sure. Yeah. Everything's fine.

317
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,029
你没事吧?
You okay?

318
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,001
Sun?

319
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:31,079
Sun?

320
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:38,055
Sun?

321
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,022
Sun  你没事吧?
Sun, are you all right?

322
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,016
恩  没事
Yes, I'm fine.

323
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,001
你整节课都心烦意乱
You were distracted for our entire lesson.

324
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:53,014
一定有什么事
You're not fine.

325
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:04,082
我们...Jin和我去看了医生
We...Jin and I went to see a doctor.

326
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:10,055
他说我不能生孩子
He said I cannot have children.

327
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:15,030
我...很遗憾  Sun
I'm... very sorry, Sun.

328
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:19,086
我却很高兴
I was glad.

329
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:25,007
为什么我们会在这儿?

330
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,053
因为你教我英文

331
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:32,076
事实上你一个月前就可以说得很流利了

332
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:35,040
你为什么学英文?

333
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:40,052
因为...

334
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,054
我想移居去美国

335
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:51,016
你打算离开Jin

336
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,026
我曾为了一个女人而去美国

337
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:00,082
因为我知道我爱上她了

338
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:05,008
但你却不能脱离你的生活

339
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:13,093
Jin呢?  他是我生活的一部分么?

340
00:27:15,064 --> 00:27:16,076
我该留下就因为...

341
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:21,033
我没说你应该为了Jin而留下
I'm not saying you should stay for jin.

342
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:50,006
介意我坐下么?
You mind?

343
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,062
你能睡时应该多睡会儿
You should sleep while you can

344
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,089
嗯...我睡不着
Yeah...I can't sleep.

345
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:16,036
大家都不喜欢我
People don't like me.

346
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:21,087
我平生试了所有的可能
I've tried to get them to most of my life.

347
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:28,043
我想我得暂时放弃这个念头
I guess I just gave up awhile back.

348
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:35,064
我是说...我就是我
I mean...I am what I am.

349
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:45,049
但是你...你恨我是有理由的
But you...you've got a good reason to hate me.

350
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:55,097
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

351
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:58,096
我为我所做的道歉
I'm sorry for what I did.

352
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:11,054
你在保护你们的人
You were trying to protect your people.

353
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,065
杀死Shannon的不是你  而是他们
It wasn't you that killed Shannon. It was them.

354
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:24,089
一旦我知道他是他们的一员...
And once we find out he is one of them...

355
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:28,070
我是不会留情的
then something will have to be done.

356
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,023
怎么了?
What?

357
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:47,096
没什么
Nothing.

358
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:52,052
要下雨了
It's gonna rain.

359
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:54,049
我们得出发了
We should get moving.

360
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,077
早上好  谁要吃早饭?
Morning! Who wants breakfast?

361
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,050
我有番木瓜果
I have papayas and papayas.

362
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,071
我们走吧
Let's go.

363
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:03,096
对啊  干吗要吃呢?
Right. Why eat?

364
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:17,053
就是这儿了
This is it.

365
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:27,067
他的热气球应该很大  是么?
His balloon would be rather large, right?

366
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,093
早就知道没有了
Why am I not surprised?

367
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:33,090
我们得再找找
We need to look some more.

368
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:36,008
他说热气球就在这儿的
This is where he said it would be.

369
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,064
如果我们要回头  Sayid
If I'm gonna back your play on this, Sayid,

370
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,014
我们得确信这里没有
we need to be sure.

371
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:47,039
我把这地方分成三块
I'll divide the area into three grids.

372
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:52,007
我们彻头彻尾得找
We'll search as thoroughly as you please.

373
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:10,076
哦  天哪
Oh, for the love of god!

374
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,075
哦  不 不 不 不  这不是用来抓鱼的
Oh, no, no, no, no. It's not for fish.

375
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:24,010
不 不 不  是抓牡蛎的
No, no, no. Oysters.

376
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:27,061
牡蛎
Pearl.

377
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:32,025
珍珠  给Rose的珍珠
Oyster. Pearl. For rose.

378
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:39,060
没有牡蛎  这儿没有牡蛎
No oyster here.Ah. Of course not.

379
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:44,016
当然了  这儿怎么会有?
Why would there be?

380
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,082
哟  伙计们

381
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,031
Sawyer

382
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:51,044
你还这么忙啊
Way to go, papa-san. You didn't waste much time.

383
00:31:52,022 --> 00:31:54,097
我应该给你根雪茄庆祝  可惜我给抽完了
I'd give you a cigar, Bernie, but I'm fresh out.

384
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:56,045
Sun怀孕了?
Sun's pregnant?

385
00:31:56,064 --> 00:32:00,078
别大声  伙计  我想Jin还不知道呢
Keep it down there, Suzy. I don't think Jin Sr. here knows yet.

386
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,010
你在干什么?

387
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:35,017
我在弥补我的错误

388
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:40,068
你不需要这样做...

389
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:44,045
不  我要

390
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:55,010
-我需要你  -什么?

391
00:32:55,022 --> 00:33:02,080
我不想再吵架了  而且我不能...

392
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,048
我不能和其他人交流

393
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:15,040
我听不懂他们说的

394
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:20,008
我需要你  Sun

395
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:26,029
-Jin  我...  -都过去了  我很抱歉

396
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:31,022
-我错了...  -我怀孕了

397
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:37,085
什么?  你...

398
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:41,096
我怀孕了  Jin

399
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:50,098
Jin  你听我说

400
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,072
什么?

401
00:33:52,094 --> 00:33:59,030
有些事...有些事我要告诉你

402
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,007
Sun  Sun

403
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:22,090
Kim医生?

404
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:25,023
可以上车么?

405
00:34:25,057 --> 00:34:27,087
什么事啊?

406
00:34:28,017 --> 00:34:30,025
拜托  我有话和你说

407
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:39,073
等等  等下  Sun

408
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:43,085
我犯了个严重的错误

409
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:49,020
不能生孩子的不是你

410
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,050
什么?

411
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:54,018
是他  是你的丈夫不能生育

412
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,089
可是你为什么...

413
00:34:57,002 --> 00:35:02,006
我不得已  我很抱歉  你的丈夫...

414
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,068
他是给你父亲办事的

415
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:12,018
如果我和他说他不能生育

416
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,073
他会把我家移平的

417
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:20,048
那你为什么现在来告诉我?

418
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:25,038
因为你该知道真相

419
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:43,000
你为什么不早跟我说?

420
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:52,027
我怎么能说?

421
00:35:54,042 --> 00:36:05,012
如果是我...是我不能... 怎么会有孩子?

422
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:12,032
我向你发誓  Jin

423
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,067
我没和其它男人好过

424
00:36:19,006 --> 00:36:21,010
这是真的

425
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:40,030
那这就是个奇迹了

426
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,028
如果是个男孩...

427
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:19,031
我想用我父亲的名字中的一个字来给他取名

428
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:26,039
也可以考虑一下我妈妈的

429
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,038
我们要不要告诉其他人?

430
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,080
Jack和Kate已经知道了

431
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:42,047
Sawyer可能也知道了...

432
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:49,078
那Benard一定也知道了

433
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,092
我们很幸运不用一个个去说了

434
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:57,018
准备好去吃午饭了么?

435
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:59,095
我们回去吧

436
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:05,083
我还想再呆一会儿

437
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:09,053
独自一个人

438
00:38:11,095 --> 00:38:14,026
如果你同意的话

439
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:21,092
好吧

440
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:25,084
我在海滩等你

441
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:27,039
我爱你

442
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:48,024
我...爱...你
I...love...you.

443
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:34,086
那本书怎样?
How is it?

444
00:39:36,004 --> 00:39:38,048
人们拒绝先知  杀了他们
Men reject their prophets and slay them.

445
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:43,007
但是他们又热爱他们的殉教者 尊敬被他们杀了的人
But they love their martyrs and honor thosewhom they have slain.

446
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:47,050
那么殉教者和先知有区别么?
So what's the difference between a martyr and a prophet?

447
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:50,040
不管是哪个  最后都得死
Either way, sounds like you end up dead.

448
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:53,074
就是这样
That's the spirit.

449
00:39:56,094 --> 00:40:00,033
要吃早饭么?
You in the mood for some breakfast?

450
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:17,051
这电脑是干什么的?
What's the computer for?

451
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,058
没什么
Nothing.

452
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:26,044
麦片?
Cereal?

453
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:29,004
你们从哪儿来的麦片?
Wow, where did you guys get cereal?

454
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:33,063
一直都是这下面的  食品室里都是吃的
It was down here all along. The pantry's full of food.

455
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,071
没过期吧?
How old is it?

456
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,096
你们也没知道多少?
You guys don't know much, huh?

457
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:48,037
我是说我一直在问这里的各种各样的问题
I mean, I'd be asking all kinds of questions about all this stuff down here.

458
00:40:48,074 --> 00:40:51,035
你们看起来并不是这么好奇
You guys don't even seem that curious.

459
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:53,058
麦片你还要不要吃了?
Do you want the cereal or don't you?

460
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,005
这肯定是对我表现好的奖励
This must be my reward for good behavior, huh?

461
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:03,019
我想我给Ana画了地图后 终于得到你们一点好意了
I guess I earned myself some goodwill for finally drawing that map for Ana.

462
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,085
什么地图?
What map?

463
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,060
去我热气球那儿的地图
To my balloon.

464
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:12,045
-你知...  -不
-Did you...  -No.

465
00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:18,099
你们互相还真是不信任啊
Wow. You guys have some real trust issues, don't you?

466
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:23,067
难怪她都不告诉你们
Guess it makes sense she didn't tell you.

467
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:27,010
我是说  你们一直在相互较劲...
I mean, with the two of you fighting all the time...

468
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:33,035
如果我是他们中的一个...
'course if I was one of them...

469
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:35,099
那些你们认为是敌人的人...
these people that you seem to think are your enemies...

470
00:41:36,082 --> 00:41:38,059
我会怎么做?
what would I do?

471
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:45,004
那就不会有什么热气球了
Hmm. There'd be no balloon.

472
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:49,094
我会画一张去隐秘的地方的地图
So I'd draw a map to a real secluded place

473
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:56,009
像是山洞或是草丛什么的 设圈套的好地方...
like a cave or some underbrush...

474
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,051
设下埋伏
good place for a trap.

475
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,060
当你们的朋友去到那儿时
An ambush.

476
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,073
一群我的人会等在那里
And when your friends got there, a bunch of my people would be waiting for 'em.

477
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,042
然后他们会拿你们的朋友来和我交换
And then they'd use them to trade for me.

478
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:17,080
还好我不是他们的一员
I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh?

479
00:42:23,093 --> 00:42:26,053
你们有牛奶么?
You guys got any milk?

480
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:43,050
