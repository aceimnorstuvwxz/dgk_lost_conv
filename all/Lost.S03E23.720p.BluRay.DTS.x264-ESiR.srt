1
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:21,093
您已接通310-555-0...

2
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,000
需要帮助吗?
Can I help you?

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,062
抱歉  我...
Sorry. I...

4
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:17,057
其实  我来...
Actually, I came...

5
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:20,096
葬礼结束了吗?
Is the funeral over?

6
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:24,010
这没有葬礼 先生  只有守灵
There was no funeral, sir. Only a viewing.

7
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,072
一个人也没有来
Nobody showed up.

8
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:30,003
没有人?  你确定吗?
Nobody? You sure?

9
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:33,062
只有你一个 请接受我最诚恳的哀悼
Just you.My deepest condolences.

10
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:36,014
你是朋友还是家人?
Friend or family?

11
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:40,090
都不是
Neither.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,078
要我打开吗?
Would you like me to open it up?

13
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,086
不
No.

14
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,074
不用
No.

15
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:49,016
请自便
Take your time.

16
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:24,003
该死
Damn it.

17
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,094
Danielle

18
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,065
还有多远?
How much further?

19
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:42,013
大约一小时
About an hour.

20
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:45,064
那个无线电塔 你上次去是什么时候?
The radio tower...when was the last time you were there?

21
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:48,090
我录下求救信号的那一天
The day I recorded the message.

22
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,017
我会带你去那个塔  但我不会离开这里的
I'll take you to the tower, but I'm not leaving the island.

23
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,001
什么?
What?

24
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,061
在那里我已经无家可归了
There's no place for me back there.

25
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:59,043
这里才是我的家
This is my home now.

26
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,013
你好 Jack
Hello Jack

27
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:26,042
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

28
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,050
Ben说了什么?
What did Ben say?

29
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,011
我们能杀他了吗?
Can we kill him?

30
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:01,040
怎么才能把这个关掉?
Is it possible to turn this equipment off?

31
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,044
什么?
What?

32
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:05,015
阻挠岛上信号的机器 你能关掉它吗?
The equipment that's jamming the island, can you turn it off?

33
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,037
当然  Ben给了我们密码
Sure. Ben gave us the code.

34
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:08,082
只有你们知道吗?
You are the only ones who have it?

35
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:11,027
是啊  怎么了?
Yeah. Why?

36
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:14,034
如果这个站被淹了会怎么样?
What would happen if the station were to be flooded?

37
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,023
不会怎么样
Nothing.

38
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,080
这些设备都是防水的
The casing for the equipment is waterproof.

39
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,013
它们会一直运行下去
It'll keep going forever.

40
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,043
那你们为什么在这里?
Then why do you need to be here?

41
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,029
因为这是Ben的命令
Because Ben told us to.

42
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,048
我们只是服从命令
We were following orders.

43
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:23,081
你从来没有问过原因吗?
And you never asked why?

44
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,062
不  因为我相信他
No, because I trust him,

45
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,054
我相信Jacob
and I trust Jacob,

46
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:31,000
如果我质疑他的命令的话 这些事...
and the minute I start questioning orders, this whole thing...

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,064
我们做的一切 都会前功尽弃
everything that we're doing here...falls apart.

48
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,090
她说的没错
She makes an excellent point.

49
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:01,024
不要!

50
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,003
求你了...
Please...

51
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,041
抱歉 Bonnie
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

52
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,038
我也只是服从命令
I, too, am following orders.

53
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:20,089
不  Des!  Des!

54
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,022
我们需要她
We need her.

55
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,010
我不认为我们还有功夫...
I don't believe we've had the pleasure...

56
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,064
别跟他说话!
Don't talk to him!

57
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,017
你想怎么样?
What do you want?

58
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:57,062
占用一下你的时间
Just a moment of your time...

59
00:06:57,062 --> 00:07:01,017
我们两个单独谈谈
to talk, you and me, alone.

60
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:02,054
为什么?
For what?

61
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,032
你刚杀了我们七个人
You've just killed seven of my people.

62
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,081
你至少也能给我五分钟吧
The least you can give me is five minutes.

63
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,069
他是一个人吗?
Is he alone?

64
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:16,013
只有两个踪迹 他和她的
There's only two sets of tracks... his and hers.

65
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:26,034
就五分钟
Five minutes.

66
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:49,027
抱歉  先生 这张处方已经不能再配药了
I'm sorry, sir, there are no more refills left on this prescription.

67
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,074
一定是搞错了  我...
Well, that... That's a mistake.I...

68
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,071
我只领过两次
I only refilled it twice.

69
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,074
你能再帮我看下吗?
Could you check again?

70
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:00,053
我已经查过了  Shephard医生 你已经拿过3次药了
I did check it again, Dr. Shephard,and that was the third refill,

71
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:03,033
我也无能为力
so there's nothing I can do.

72
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,044
我这里还有一张处方
Fine. I've got another prescription right here.

73
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:09,032
我认识你
Hey, I know you.

74
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,056
-你是那个英雄  -我才不是什么英雄
-You're the hero.  -I'm not a hero.

75
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,090
我们在电视上看到过
We saw it on TV.

76
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,094
女士  你怎么回事?
Hey, lady, what's wrong with you?

77
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,011
他要什么就给他吧 知道他做了什么吗?
Give this guy whatever he needs.You know what he did?

78
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,000
是这个...
Here, just... Here...

79
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,034
复方羟氢可待因
Oxycodone.

80
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,086
Shephard医生 你不能给自己开处方
Dr. Shephard, you can't write a prescription for yourself.

81
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,051
这又不是给我的
That's not me.

82
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,035
是给Christian Shephard医生的
That's Dr.Christian Shephard.

83
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,059
我是Jack Shephard医生
I'm Dr.Jack Shephard.

84
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,050
他是我父亲
He's my father.

85
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,001
我得给你父亲办公室 打电话来确认一下
I'm gonna call his office to confirm...

86
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,006
他已经出城了
He's out of town right now.

87
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:32,059
办公室总有人...
I'm sure somebody in the office...

88
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,000
别麻烦了
Don't bother.

89
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,064
请坐
Have a seat.

90
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:04,001
Jack 不久前我做了个决定
Not so long ago, Jack,I made a decision

91
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:08,054
决定在一天内 夺走四十多个人的生命
that took the lives of over 40 people in a single day.

92
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,054
我告诉你是因为...
I'm telling you this because...

93
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:17,014
这里  历史还会重演
history is about to repeat itself right here,right now.

94
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,074
我猜  你们...
Let me guess. You've...

95
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:22,077
已经包围了我们 如果我不照做的话  你们...
You've got us surrounded,and if I don't do what you say,

96
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,012
你们就会杀死我们所有人
You're gonna kill all my people.

97
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,035
不 Jack
No, Jack.

98
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:27,040
是你
You are.

99
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,069
我怎么会呢?
And how am I gonna do that?

100
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:33,082
和你一起来的那个女人
The woman you're traveling with...

101
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:37,055
从直升机跳伞下来的那个女人
the one who parachuted onto the island from a helicopter...

102
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:41,003
她不是她所说的那个人
she's not who she says she is.

103
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,042
不是吗?
She's not, huh?

104
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:44,092
没错
No, she's not.

105
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:46,064
那她是谁?
Then who is she?

106
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:51,069
她代表想找到这座岛的人
She's a representative of some people who have been trying to find this island.

107
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:56,060
她是个坏人
She's one of the bad guys.

108
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,077
我差点忘了  你们是...
I almost forgot. You're the...

109
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:01,007
你们都是好人
You're the good guys.

110
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,061
Jack 听我说
Jack, listen to me.

111
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:10,053
如果你联络她的船 这座岛上所有的生物都会死的
If you phone her boat,every single living person on this island will be killed.

112
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:15,077
这样吧
So here's what has to happen.

113
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:17,076
把那个设备
Get that device...

114
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:20,029
她随身带着的那个电话
the phone she carries with her...

115
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,098
交给我
and give it to me.

116
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,047
我就会转过身去
I will turn around.

117
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,047
你走你的独木桥
We'll go back to my people.

118
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:28,097
我走我的阳关道
You will turn around,go back to your people.

119
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:31,074
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

120
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,032
-能把对讲机还给我吗?  -什么?
-May I have my walkie back?  -What?

121
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,086
有些东西你一定很想听
There's something you need to hear.

122
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:47,031
拜托?
Please?

123
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,057
谢谢
Thank you.

124
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:02,022
Tom 你在吗?
Tom, are you there?

125
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:05,091
是的
Yeah, I'm here.

126
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,053
你们害死了我们七个人
Your plan killed seven of my people,

127
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:11,058
但没有死的 正抓着你的朋友
but the ones that you failed to kill are now holding your friends

128
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:14,096
Jin  Sayid  Bernard 都在枪口上
Jin, Sayid, Bernard, at gunpoint.

129
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:17,008
Jack 别给他任何... 啊!  住手!
Jak,don't give him any...

130
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,038
给我闭嘴!
I said shut up

131
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:24,071
我现在就掐断你的脖子...
And what's to stop me from snapping your neck...

132
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:28,036
Tom 如果我一分钟之内还没发话 就把他们三个都杀了
Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, shoot all three of them.

133
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:30,015
收到
got it!

134
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:32,062
我说了别动!
I said don't move!

135
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:38,030
把电话给我
Bring me the phone.

136
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,047
不要和他们谈条件!

137
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:44,050
40秒
40 seconds.

138
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,002
不
No.

139
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:48,020
我要把他们带出这座岛 他们所有人!
I'm getting them all off the island. All of 'em!

140
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,078
我想问问你
Let me ask you something.

141
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:51,023
为什么你想离开这里?
Why do you want to leave the island?

142
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:54,060
是什么让你如此 迫不及待的想要回去?
What is it you so desperately wanna get back to?

143
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,037
你一无所有了
You have no one.

144
00:11:56,037 --> 00:12:00,041
你父亲死了  妻子也和别人好了
Your father's dead. Your wife left you,moved on with another man.

145
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:05,014
你难道非得回到医院  继续救死扶伤吗?
Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital,get back to fixing things?

146
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:07,046

然后杀了你

161
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:06,012
现在你可以报复Ben了
You have the opportunity to make Ben very, very angry.

162
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,007

在键盘上
On the keypad.

175
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:43,014
那些数字...
The numbers...

176
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,034
就是音符
they're notes.

177
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,045
这个程序是  一个音乐家设计的

178
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,051
把他绑起来

00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,013
把他一起带上
He's coming with us.

00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:42,042

00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:48,016

这是你母亲

183

可以帮我把他绑起来吗?
Will you help me tie him up?

184
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:44,099
怎么了?  他都说了什么?
What happened? What'd he say?

185
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,035
已经不重要了
It's not important right now.

186
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:50,072
-把大家集合起来  -Jack你的手

187
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,038
发生什么事了?
What happened?

188
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:09,061
他杀了他们
He killed them.

189
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:13,058
Bernard...

190
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:16,092
Jin  Sayid  他们3个...
Jin  Sayid. All three of'em. He...

191
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:20,065
他和海滩上的人取得联系
He radioed the beach.

192
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:23,065
而我什么都做不了
And I let it happen.

193
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:29,074
我只能这么做
I had to let it happen.

194
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,048
我们不能让Rose知道...
We can't tell Rose...

195
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,069
还有Sun 至少现在不行
or Sun, not yet.

196
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:40,038
我们得出发了  我答应Sayid我们会继续前进
We gotta keep moving. I promised Sayid that we would keep moving.

197
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,091
为什么把他带来?
So why did you bring him back?

198
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:47,058
怎么不直接杀了他?
Why didn't you just kill him?

199
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:50,061
因为我想让他目睹...
Because I want him to see it.

200
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,005
我们离开岛上的那一刻
I want him to experience the moment that we get off this island,

201
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:56,091
我还要让他知道...
and I want him to know...

202
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:59,095
他失败了
That he failed.

203
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,006
然后我会杀了他
And then I'll kill him.

204
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,080
那是命令 Tom
It was an order, Tom.

205
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,064
我们必须服从
We had to follow it.

206
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:14,092
Ben根本就不知道自己在说什么
Ben didn't know what the hell he's talking about.

207
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:16,062
他已经糊涂了
He's lost it.

208
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,041
看他对我们都做了什么
I mean, look at what they did to us!

209
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,007
我们不该往沙子里开抢
Instead of putting three bullets in the damn sand,

210
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:23,085
应该直接杀了他们
we should've killed them for real.

211
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:36,068
他们只有三个人和四把枪
All they got left is three guys and four guns.

212
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:41,002
可我们只有两个人  一把枪也没有
And all we've got, James,are two people and no guns.

213
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:42,044
那我们等到晚上
So we'll wait till night.

214
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:44,083
到了那时我们还是 无能为力
That isn't gonna change the fact that we're unarmed.

215
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:48,015
如果你想送死  请自便 但在这之前...
If you wanna kill yourself, that's fine,but before you go and try...

216
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:54,018
听见了吗?
You hear that?

217
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,030
Ryan!

218
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:23,017
等等  英雄
Stay in the bus, hero.

219
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:55,015
别动 Tom
Stay right there, Tom.

220
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:03,028
好吧
ok

221
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:06,006
我投降
I give up.

222
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:18,007
这枪是为了那个 被你拽下木筏的孩子
That's for taking the kid off the raft.

223
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:26,002
老兄  他已经投降了
Dude, it was over. He surrendered.

224
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:29,095
我不相信他
I didn't believe him.

225
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:13,012
你在干什么  Shephard医生?
What are you doing, Dr.Shephard?

226
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:15,032
我只是...
I was just...

227
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:18,018
想看一下...
I was just checking the...

228
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:20,046
Arlen的情况... 我想看看...
The Arlen charts. Just wanted to...

229
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,012
手术的如何
Wanted to see how the operation went.

230
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:26,070
我给你留了三条语音信息 你没收到吗?
I left three messages on your voice mail. You didn't get them?

231
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,011
我电话坏了
My phone's broken.

232
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:34,017
到我办公室来一下
Let's go to my office.

233
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:39,015

235
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:45,015
-还不真正了解我  -我知道的够多的了

236
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:49,025
-还是到我办公室来一下吧  -有话就直说吧!
-So let's go to my office...  -If you got something to say to me,say it to me

237
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:52,060
就在这里
Right here.

238
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,021
能离开会儿吗?
Will you excuse us, please?

239
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,077
你救了的那个女人Arlen太太 两小时前醒过来了
Mrs. Arlen, the woman you saved,woke up in recovery about two hours ago.

240
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:10,042
她还有些疼痛  不过神智完全清醒
She was in some pain but highly responsive to the reflex tests and entirely lucid.

241
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:14,046
很好啊
Well, that's...That's great.

242
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:20,015
她也回忆起了事发经过
But then she described the series of events that caused her accident.

243
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:25,070
她说她正在桥上行驶 看见桥上站着个人
She says she was driving over the bridge when she saw a man standing on top of the railing

244
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,022
正准备往下跳
about to jump off.

245
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,058
她分了神  车子失了控
She was distracted and lost control of her car.

246
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:39,016
她开进了隔离带  后面的货车就撞上了她
She ran into the median,rolled over and was hit by the van behind her.

247
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:43,045
所以问题很明显...
So the obvious question here...

248
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:46,072
为什么你那么快就 到了事发现场?
It's how did you get to that flaming car so fast?

249
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:52,011
你在那桥上做什么?
What were you doing on that bridge?

250
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,064
你知道我在这医院 工作了多久吗?
Do you know how many years I've worked at this hospital?

251

你了解我吗?
Do you know...anything about me?

252
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:08,099
你知不知道...
Do you have any idea...

253
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,034
我都经历了些什么?
what I've been through?

254
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:14,071
你今天喝了多少?
How much have you had to drink today?

255
00:23:14,074 --> 00:23:16,056
好吧 我来告诉你怎么做
Okay,I'll tell you what. You do this...

256
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:19,016
你现在把我父亲叫下来
You get my father down here.

257
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:25,080
如果我比他还醉的话 你就可以开除我了
Get him down here right now,and if I'm drunker than he is,you can fire me.

258
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:30,078
别用这种眼神看着我 别...可怜我
Don't you look at me like that.Don't you... pity me.

259
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:35,029

-I'm trying to help you...  -You can't help me!

260

If you're listening to this,I want you to know that we got you bastards,

262
