这些人很聪明
These people are smart

4
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:14,040
同时还很残忍  如果你认为
and there animals If you think

5
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:16,039
仅凭单枪匹马
that one gun and one bullet

6
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:19,045
就能阻止他们
is gonna stop them.

7
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:20,099
好好想想我的话吧
Think it again.

8
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,052
我要去找我的儿子
I am going to find my son

9
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:24,099
没人能阻止我  明白吗  
and nobody is gonna to stop me, okay?

10
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:27,099
-我和你一起去  -不行  就我一个
-I'll go with you  -No, I have to do it alone.

11
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,099
我打算越过底线
I'm going out the line where I'm not suppose to cross

12
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:34,002
然后告诉他们我们已抓到你了
and telling them we got you.

13
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,082
他们决不会交出Walt的

14
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,032
Michael

15
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:49,009
Michael

16
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,052
Michael

17
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,089
他怎么了 
What's wrong with him?

18
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:56,075
Michael Michael

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,029
Michael

20
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:04,089
Jack  你去哪  或许他们放了他
Jack, where are you going? Maybe they just let him go.

21
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:07,092
放了他  他可就只有他一个
Let him go, he is alone.

22
00:01:07,095 --> 00:01:10,065
他们只是仅仅把他推到丛林 Jack
They just put him out of the jungle.

23
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,022
就他一个  
He is alone.

24
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:17,099
好吧
Okay.

25
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,049
我们走吧
Let's go.

26
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,065
过会见, Ana Lucia
See ya, Ana Lucia.

27
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,059
你看上去很疲惫啊
You look tired.

28
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:11,065
算吧  谢谢关心
Yeah, thanks.

29
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,082
怎么了  
What?

30
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:15,065
你昨晚在哪里  
Where were you last night?

31
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,065
在家呆着
Home.

32
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,039
整晚都在  
All night?

33
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,032
对  给自己做了点晚饭  还看了会儿电视
Yeah. I cooked myself some dinner, watched some TV.

34
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:23,082
你看了什么节目  
What'd you watch

35
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,002
让我们好好谈一下
Let's go for a drive.

36
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,032
还记得Jason Alder吗  
Remember Jason Alder?

37
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:42,052
凌晨三点在停车场发现了他的尸体
Found him in a parking lot just after three in the morning.

38
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:45,045
他死后一小时才被人发现
He was dead an hour before anyone saw him.

39
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:47,032
在案发现场的垃圾桶里发现了一把枪
Crime Scene pulled a gun from the dumpster.

40
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:49,062
没有枪支登记记录
Registration was filed off.

41
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,055
没有指纹,也没有目击者
No prints. No witnesses.

42
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:53,015
他就像是被处死的
He was executed.

43
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,062
有凶手的线索吗  
Any idea who did it?

44
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,022
是的  Ana  就是你干的
Yeah, Ana. You did.

45
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:02,025
这个人招供曾残忍地朝你开枪
This man confesses to shooting you in cold blood

46
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:05,045
但是你拒绝指证他  所以我们不得不放了他
and you refuse to ID him. So we had to cut him loose.

47
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,099
一周后  他就胸中五弹而亡
A week later, he shows up with five bullets in him

48
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:09,095
因为有人残忍地枪杀了他
because someone shot him in cold blood.

49
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:14,012
看来我应该请一个律师
Guess I should get a lawyer.

50
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:17,002
听着  我们都知道
Look, we both know

51
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:19,052
这会成为一个无头案
that this is gonna be a dead-end investigation.

52
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:22,002
但是  Ana  如果真是你干的...
But, Ana, if you did this...

53
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:25,062
真是你干的话  你应该让我来帮你
if you did this, you have to let me help you.

54
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:29,015
谢谢你  妈妈  但是我不需要你的帮助   
Thanks, Mom, but I don't need your help.

55
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,072
你不要我的帮助 那你也应该从别人那里获得帮助
You don't want my help, you're gonna have to get it from somewhere else.

56
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:36,025
Ana  你是个警官
You're a police officer, Ana.

57
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,075
你不尊重我也就罢了  但是你至少得对得起这个职业
If you don't respect me, at least respect that.

58
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,019
那好  我不干了
Then I quit.

59
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:06,089
Henry

60
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,099
你打算怎样  
what do you say?

61
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:15,009
Henry 你到底要绝食到什么时候  
How long you gonna keep up this hunger strike, Henry?

62
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:24,065
我有没有告诉过你我曾是警察  
I ever tell you I was a cop?

63
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:30,049
我这一生碰到过很多杀人犯
I've been around a lot of killers in my life.

64
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:33,069
你知道这些人中最让我惊奇的是什么吗  
You know what surprises me the most about them?

65
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,032
那就是他们个个都很爱扯淡
How much they love to talk.

66
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:45,055
但是你和他们不同... Henry
But you're different, Henry.

67
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:49,089
还保持沉默
Quiet.

68
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,099
你咕哝些什么  
What was that?

69
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,092
如果你想说什么的话,
If you're gonna say something

70
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:04,095
你就得说出声来
you're gonna have to speak...

71
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,042
你杀了我们中的两人
You killed two of us.

72
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:17,022
他们都是好人 都想放过你
Good people who were leaving you alone.

73
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:25,092
你才是杀人犯  Ana Lucia
You're the killer, Ana Lucia.

74
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:46,032
看上去他终于决定开口了
I guess he decided to start talking?

Mike 来份龙舌兰酒加奎宁水
Mike. Tequila-tonic.

78
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,055
忙活了一整天吧  
Long day

79
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:37,058
很高兴又见到你了
Good to see you again.

80
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:40,095
你在安检处检查过我
You "wanded" me at security.

81
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:45,051
请再来一杯
Another one, please.

82
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:48,008
你是怎么开始从事安检工作的  
So how does one get into "wanding"?

83
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:52,051
不当警察后
One stops being a cop.

84
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:55,081
太巧了  我刚刚辞去医生的工作
What a coincidence. I just stopped being a doctor.

85
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,065
你为什么辞了  
Why'd you quit?

86
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:02,055
不是我主动要辞 
I didn't.

87
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:04,055
是我的儿子出卖了我 他告密说我在工作期间喝酒
My son ratted me out for drinking on the job.

88
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,055
谢谢你的酒
Thank you.

89
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,058
执照被吊销了
Lost my license.

90
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:13,051
是的  我知道  这听起来很搞笑
Yeah, I know, it's hilarious.

91
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:16,011
不  没有  我仅仅是想说
No, no, it's just that,

92
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:18,061
我不相信父母和他们的孩子
I don't believe that parents and their kids

93
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:20,051
可以一起工作
should work together.

94
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:22,001
因为矛盾实在太多了
Too many issues.

95
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:26,001
为你刚才的一番话干杯
I'll drink to that.

96
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,071
你去哪  
So, where you headed?

97
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:32,075
悉尼  澳大利亚
Sydney. Sydney, Australia.

98
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:36,018
想一起去吗  
You wanna come?

99
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,005
我是当真的
I'm serious.

100
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:43,021
我为什么要和你一起去悉尼  
Why would I go to Sydney with you?

101
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:46,011
或许是命运将我们连在一块
Maybe fate to get us together

102
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:49,081
就像我们俩能够在这个机场一起喝酒一样
You know, like two drinks in an airport bar.

103
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:52,091
缘分为什么要这么做  
Why would fate do that?

104
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:55,041
这是缘分一贯的行事方法
Same reason fate does anything

105
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:58,068
只有这样我们才可以互相帮助
so that we can help each other out.

106
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:01,038
你确实需要帮助  不是吗  
You do need help, right?

107
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:05,021
除非你不需要
Unless you don't.

108
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:13,088
我在那儿干的事可能会比较危险
What I'm doing down there could be dangerous.

109
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:16,048
所以我需要有人能够来保护我  比如贴身保镖
I need someone to protect me, a bodyguard.

110
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:18,038
你就是绝佳的人选
It's perfect for someone

111
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,058
因为你刚从警察退下来
who "stopped being a cop".

112
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,038
我都不知道你的名字
I don't even know your name

113
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,048
我们还是都不要用真名吧
Ooh. Let's not use real names

114
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:33,095
不如这样  你给我取个名字  
I'll tell you what, why don't you pick a name for me,

115
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:36,001
我也给你起个名字  如何  
and then I'll pick one for you.

116
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:42,095
就叫你Tom吧
You look like a "Tom".

117
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:44,085
Tom  多棒的名字啊
Tom. What an excellent name.

118
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:47,075
那我就叫你...
And you should be a...

119
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:49,045
Sarah

120
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,088
为澳大利亚干杯
Australia.

121
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:17,068
发生什么了  
What happened?

122
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,095
刮脸的时候刮伤了自己
I cut myself shaving.

123
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,018
舱里的那个人想要杀我
The guy in the hatch tried to kill me.

124
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:35,081
你没事吧  
You OK?

125
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,065
我没事...
I'm fine.

126
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:42,055
但是他不会好过
But he won't be.

127
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:44,041
Ana?

128
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:46,021
怎么  
What?

129
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:49,071
不要干傻事
Don't do anything stupid.

130
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,015
如果你是来道歉的话,
If you've come to apologize

131
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:28,058
那我原谅你用拐杖来打我
I forgive you for hitting me with your crutch.

132
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:34,041
我很庆幸我的头没被打破
I'm so glad my head didn't break it.

133
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:37,085
为什么  
Why?

134
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:41,058
那可是个大问题
Now that's a broad question.

135
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:46,041
你为什么要去对付Ana Lucia而不是我  
Why did you try to hurt Ana Lucia but not me?

136
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:51,018
我不知道你指什么  John  
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at, John.

137
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:55,085
我被那扇爆炸飞出的门给压住了...陷于绝望中
I was trapped under that blast door....Helpless.

138
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,078
你本可以碾碎我的头颅
You could've crushed my skull.

139
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:59,095
但是你没有那样做
But you didn't do a thing.

140
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:02,035
你为什么没有动手  
Why didn't you?

141
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:05,028
因为你也是个好人  John
Because you're one of the good ones, John.

142
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:09,061
什么   好在哪里  
What? Good what?

143
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:13,065
好在哪已经无所谓了 无论怎样  我都会死
None of this matters. I'm dead anyway.

144
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:17,071
医生去做交易了
The doctor's gone to make a trade,

145
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:20,021
我们大家都很清楚当他一无所获回来时  
and we both know he'll come back empty-handed, and then...

146
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:23,035
我就失去了存活下去的价值
I've lost my value.

147
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:27,065
要么Jack回来杀了我  
So either Jack comes back here and kills me

148
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:31,001
要么我的人发现我被囚禁在此  他们来杀了我
or my people find out where I'm being held and they do it.

149
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:34,008
为什么你自己人会想来杀你  
Why would your own people want to kill you?

150
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:39,015
因为那个带头大哥  
Because the man in charge...

151
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:41,015
他是个了不起的人物  John
He's a great man, John,

152
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,038
是个睿智的人
a brilliant man.

153
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,071
但他从不会宽恕别人
But he is not a forgiving man.

154
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:53,015
我把事办砸了  所以他一定会杀了我
He'll kill me because I failed, John.

155
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:56,085
任务失败了
I failed my mission.

156
00:11:56,088 --> 00:12:00,011
什么任务  
What mission?

157
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:06,008
当我中了那个女人的圈套被抓后  
When that woman caught me in her trap,

158
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,061
我才来到了这里
I was on my way here, John.

159
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:12,055
我是为你而来
I was coming for you.

160
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,098
Locke

161
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:20,068
Locke  出来  
Locke, get out here!

162
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:22,055
Locke

163
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:26,008
Locke

164
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,051
John!

165
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:56,085
我用了20分钟才把这些东西给弄下来
I've been knocking those things down for 20 minutes.

166
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,095
把你那该死的手从我的芒果上拿开
Get your hands off my damn mangoes.

167
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:01,045
看不出你还很在行摘水果啊
Didn't figure you for the fruit-picking type.

168
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,068
你想怎样  
What do you want?

169
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,065
我要一把枪
I need a gun.

170
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:08,068
我看要不这样
here's an idea

171
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:12,055
不如去找你的好朋友Jack   他就有枪
Why not go to your buddy Jack? He's got himself a gun.

172
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,085
我差点忘了
That's right

173
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:16,051
他还和Kate一起在林子里闲逛呢
he's still traipsing around the jungle with Kate.

174
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:20,091
如果你觉得他抢了你女朋友 你感到不爽的话
If you've got a problem because he's making time with your girlfriend,

175
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,055
不要把气撒在我头上
don't take it out on me, man.

176
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:25,065
你还是给我把枪吧  
How about you just give me a gun?

177
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:30,015
你给我滚
Here's another idea: Scram.

178
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:34,011
你听到没有  滚  现在就给我滚
You heard me. Now, git!

179
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:07,068
Sarah

180
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:13,025
Sarah,快开门
Sarah, open the damn door!

181
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,095
很好  你还没有睡
Good, you're up.

182
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:22,081
是时候履行你的保镖职责了
It's time. Protection duty.

183
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:24,088
来吧  我们出发了
Come on, let's go.

184
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:27,055
喝了四天酒  无所事事
After four days of drinking and doing nothing,

185
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:30,031
现在是午夜时分  你到准备好出发了  
now, in the middle of the night, you're ready to go?

186
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,031
对的  完全正确
That's exactly right.

187
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:34,031
是时候了  走吧
It's time, come on

188
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:37,041
命运在召唤我们  Sarah
Fate's calling, Sarah.

189
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:52,048
就在这了  靠边停车
This is it. Pull over, right here.

190
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:59,011
这就是你所需要的保护  因为在郊区  
This is what you needed protection for? The suburbs?

191
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:01,075
就呆在车里
Just stay in the car.

192
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,075
我是不是还应该开着停车计费器  
Should I keep the meter running?

193
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,098
我能进来吗
Can I come in

194
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:42,065
听着  他是我女儿
Look, she's my daughter

195
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,065
我当然有权见她
and I have every right to see her!

196
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,078
不  你没有这个权力   出去  
No, you don't have a right. Get out!

197
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,028
我现在就要进去
I'm coming in here!

198
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,071
你不能阻拦我   她可是我女儿啊  
You can't stop me! She is my daughter

199
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,075
走开  
Get out! Get out of my house!

200
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,015
我给这房子付的按揭 
I pay the mortgage on this house!

201
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:58,051
我就是想看看我的女儿   你到底哪根筋搭错不让我看  
I wanna see my daughter!  What the hell is wrong with you?

202
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:01,025
不许你再回来  
Don't you ever come back here!

203
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,025
我正在和那个女士说话
I was just having a conversation with the lady.

204
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,005
你需要帮助  
You need help!

205
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,008
老兄  挖得不错
Dude, nice hole

206
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:27,088
怎么说  Hurley  
What is it, Hurley?

207
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:30,088
你还记得我们做的无线电吗  
man, you remember that radio we made?

208
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:34,025
我想我可以用它来放些音乐
I was thinking maybe I could get it to play some music.

209
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:36,078
为Libby放
You know, for Libby

210
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:39,078
但是它就奏效过一次  而且也是一瞬间
it worked only once, and then just for a minute.

211
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,078
后来我还试过几次
I've tried several times since

212
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,075
但是只有噪音
and only gotten static.

213
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:46,045
是这样的  即是只有杂音也行
Here's the thing: Even that would be good.

214
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,045
因为到时候  Libby会觉得
Because Libby would be like

215
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,051
"有这份心就好了" 那样我就能给她留下好印象
"It's the thought that counts. "And I'll score major points.

216
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:54,001
尤其是当她看到我在很努力地调台
Especially when she sees me holding it over my head.

217
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:57,098
那你为什么要用只能制造杂音的无线电来调台呢
And why would you hold a static-generating radio over your head?

218
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:00,081
在巴格达没有  无话不说(电影)  吗  
They didn't have Say Anything in Baghdad?

219
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,038
非常好看
It's awesome.

220
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,035
电影里  那个主角拿着手提收音机
This dude gets his boom box,

221
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:06,055
在女主角家窗前
holds it over his head outside this chick's window,

222
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,081
给她放了些Peter gabriel的歌
and plays some Peter Gabriel song for her

223
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,031
然后那女孩就喜欢上他了
and, bam, the girl's his.

224
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:12,095
在她爸爸进监狱后  然后他就抱得美人归了
I mean, after her dad goes to jail. But then he gets her.

225
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:17,015
-我想我明白你的意思了  -你真该好好看看这部电影
-I think I get the idea.  -You should check it out sometime.

226
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,041
我是说如果我们能够离开这个小岛
I mean, if we ever, you know, get off this island.

227
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,071
如果你真想为Libby做些什么的话
If you want to do something nice for Libby

228
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:28,041
三公里外有一片美丽的沙滩
there's a beautiful beach three kilometers from here.

229
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:31,048
你可以带她去那边
You could take her there.

230
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,055
你觉得她会喜欢吗  
You think she'd like that?

231
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:39,048
我带Shannon去过一次
I took Shannon there once.

232
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,095
Michael

233
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,088
Michael

234
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:53,081
能见效吗  
So it worked?

235
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,075
你在说什么  John  
What are you talking about, John?

236
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:57,025
你的那笔交易
Your deal. The trade.

237
00:17:57,028 --> 00:18:00,025
如果他们交出Michael
If they gave us Michael...

238
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:03,025
他们什么也没给
They didn't give us anything.

239
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:06,095
这么说来他遇上你们是个巧合  
So it was just a coincidence that he came wandering out?

240
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:09,061
当时我正大声喊叫  他一定是听到声音
I was shouting. He heard my voice.

241
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:13,065
怎么   难道你觉得他们放了Michael
What? They just let Michael go,

242
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:15,085
还希望我们继续履行交易  
hoping we would keep up our end of the bargain?

243
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:18,065
你觉得他们来自慈善机构  
You think they're on the honor system?

244
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:50,025
出来  出来  不管你是谁
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

245
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,048
我知道你在那儿
I know you're there.

246
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,095
别逼我出手
Don't make me come in after you.

247
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:11,031
是你啊  
What do we got here?

248
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:16,045
小红帽来找大灰狼的枪  
Was Little Red Riding Hood following the Big Bad Wolf back to his stash o' guns?

249
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:19,008
为何不现在就把枪给我呢  
Why don't you gimme that one right there?

250
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:22,008
我什么都不会给你.
I ain't gonna "gimme" you nothing.

251
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,068
我们以前也谈过这个事情  Lucy
We've been through this, Lucy.

252
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:42,085
现在要干什么呢  小姑娘  
What you gonna do now, muchacha?

253
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:23,065
来点音乐
We need some damn music in here.

254
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:26,078
她是谁  
Who was she?

255
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,051
你指谁  
Who was who?

256
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:29,055
那个女人
That woman.

257
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:32,048
Sarah  这可说来话长啊
She is a very long story, Sarah.

258
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:36,008
我叫Ana Lucia
It's Ana Lucia.

259
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:39,021
但我还是Tom
Well, I'm still Tom.

260
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:41,088
你很可悲  对  你就是那样的
You're pathetic, that's what you are.

261
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:44,085
你说得对极了
You bet your sweet ass I am.

262
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:51,085
为什么到这来  
Why are you here?

263
00:20:53,011 --> 00:20:57,091
我来这儿是因为我不想给我儿子道歉
I'm here because I can't apologize to my son.

264
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:59,091
他试着帮我
He tried to help me

265
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:01,091
我用不辞而别来感谢他
so I thanked him by cutting him off.

266
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,095
我用痛恨来回报他
I thanked him by hating him.

267
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:10,085
孩子  你来这也是因为同样的原因
You came here for the same reason I did, kiddo.

268
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:13,028
你逃出来
You ran away.

269
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:24,015
我的天啊
My, my.

270
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:28,031
看看这次命运又带来什么了(鸡尾酒吧)
Look what fate has delivered up this time.

271
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:30,041
来吧
Come on.

272
00:21:30,045 --> 00:21:33,051
一起去喝一杯  然后我们可以借醉做对可怜虫
Let's go have a drink or ten and be pathetic together.

273
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,048
怎么样  
What do you say?

274
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:45,031
不
No.

275
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:52,028
不去
No.

276
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:56,031
随你便吧
It's your call.

277
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,048
小心行人
I'm walking here!

278
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:07,041
等等
Wait!

279
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:11,035
不要去
Don't.

280
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,011
我们离开悉尼吧
Let's just get the hell out of Sydney.

281
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:17,035
一起走吧  一起回去
Let's just go. Let's go back.

282
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:21,098
我已不能再回头了
I can't ever go back.

283
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:26,078
再见了  孩子
See ya, kiddo

284
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,098
怎么了  
What?

285
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:53,018
你不想要我的联系电话吗  
Don't you want my phone number?

286
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:58,008
你要是敢告诉别人...
You tell anyone about this,

287
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:03,098
我就杀了你
and I'll kill you.

288
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:07,008
那也要一起滚下桌子吧
Guess that takes cuddling off the table.

289
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:23,015
你好
there

290
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,095
进展如何  
Oh! How's it going?

291
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:27,091
并不像你想象的那样
This isn't what it looks like.

292
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:30,088
然后呢... 那应该是怎样的  
And what does it look like?

293
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:35,088
那个... 看上去像这样...
It looks like something...

294
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:39,075
其实不是
that it's not.

295
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:43,015
好吧
man

296
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:45,008
被你活捉了
I'm so busted.

297
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:47,008
Hurley  我在这不是想告诫你
Hurley, I'm not here to tell you

298
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:49,055
不要偷吃东西的
how to act around food.

299
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:52,025
不  我不是说这个
No, I'm not busted for that.

300
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:54,041
我是说被你逮住的...
I'm busted for...

301
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:56,045
是一些其他的事情
something else.

302
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:00,078
我找吃的,
I was packing the picnic

303
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:04,038
是因为我想带你去野餐
because I was kind of hoping that you'd wanna go with me.

304
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:08,088
就我们俩
You know, as an "us" thing.

305
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:11,091
本打算给你个惊喜
But it was a surprise.

306
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:15,085
真的吗  
Really?

307
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:21,028
你真好
That's very sweet.

308
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,028
那你想去吗  
So, do you wanna go?

309
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:29,061
去哪里  
Where to?

310
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:32,011
去哪先保密  因为那还是个惊喜
Can that part still be a surprise?

311
00:24:48,098 --> 00:24:51,045
你回来了
You're back.

312
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:56,031
那其他人呢  他们没有出现  
So, the Others, they didn't show up?

313
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:58,008
没有
No.

314
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:00,048
但Michael回来了
Michael's back, though.

315
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:04,091
额头怎么了  
What happened here?

316
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:06,088
那是我的错
My fault.

317
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:08,075
我忘记关浴室的水龙头,
I left the tap on in the bathroom sink,

318
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:11,048
结果Ana滑倒了  还撞伤了头
and Ana wiped out and hit her head on the counter.

319
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,048
再次抱歉
And I'm sorry, again.

320
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:18,031
没关系的  放心吧
Yeah, don't worry about it.

321
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:20,081
Jack

322
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,038
Jack

323
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:25,085
我想他醒过来了
I think he's waking up.

324
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,075
Michael

325
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:28,095
Michael?

326
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:31,061
Jack

327
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,055
你好
man.

328
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:35,035
我...这是在哪...
where...

329
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,071
我怎么会这样... 
How did I get...

330
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:40,081
放松点  好吗  你又回到舱里了
Wait, try to take it easy, OK? You're back in the hatch.

331
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,051
-昨晚我们在丛林里发现了你  -我的头啊
-We found you out in the jungle last night.  -my head.

332
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:49,038
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

333
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,045
John.

334
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,065
我找到他们了
I found them.

335
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,031
我离开后,
After I left

336
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:08,088
向北前进,
 I hiked north.

337
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:11,001
回到了原来的地方
Back to where we were.

338
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:14,091
到了海滩,沿着海岸线走
Hiked to the beach, followed the shoreline.

339
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:19,035
一天后  我看见了一个人
A day later, I saw one.

340
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,055
他长什么样  
What did he look like?

341
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,085
很脏
He was dirty.

342
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:27,071
破烂的衣服  没穿鞋
Worn clothing. No shoes.

343
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:30,028
看上去很普通  就像其他同伙一样
Simple.Just like the rest of them.

344
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:33,031
-像其他同伙一样  -对的
-Like the rest of them?  -Yeah.

345
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:36,008
他的人  其他同伙
His people. The Others.

346
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,071
我跟踪他回到营地
I followed him back to his camp.

347
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:43,031
他们  他们住在帐篷里  帆布帐篷
They live in tents. Canvas tents

348
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,081
是那种圆锥形帐篷
and teepees.

349
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:48,061
他们吃鱼干  比我们过得还差
They eat dried fish. They're worse off than we are.

350
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,085
他们有多少人  
How many of them were there?

351
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:52,025
我数了下,有22个
I counted 22.

352
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,031
-那么船呢...  -我没有看到
-And the boat...  -I didn't see it.

353
00:26:54,035 --> 00:26:58,015
你...你有没有看到Walt  
Did you... Did you see Walt?

354
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:01,018
没有
No.

355
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,075
但我知道他肯定在那儿
But I know he's there.

356
00:27:04,078 --> 00:27:07,088
那么他们带走的其他人怎么样了  
What about everyone else they took?

357
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:10,018
辛迪   看到其他孩子了吗  
Cindy? Did you see any other kids?

358
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:14,038
没有,没有看到孩子
No. No, no kids.

359
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,065
但我认为他们和我儿子在一起
But I think they're in the same place as my boy.

360
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,028
他们也有个舱房
They have a hatch.

361
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:22,078
你怎么会知道的  
How do you know that they...

362
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:25,021
通往地下有不少金属门
There's a set of metal doors leading underground.

363
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:27,048
-还能是什么呢  -你认为那里就是孩子们被关的地方
-What else could it be?  -You think that's where they're keeping the kids?

364
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:29,056
他们日夜守候在那 
They keep it guarded 24l7.

365
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,055
两个护卫  两把枪
Two guards, two guns.

366
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:34,078
那两把枪是我所看到的所有的武器 其他人都没有武器
And two guns is all I saw. They're barely armed.

367
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:37,085
大部分是老人  其中还有一半是女人
Most of them are old. And half of them are women.

368
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:42,071
我想...
I wanted to...

369
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:51,075
但我救不了他
I couldn't save him.

370
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:54,025
所以我回来告诉你们...
So I came back to tell you.

371
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:57,085
告诉你们我们有能力救他们
To tell you that we can take them.

372
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:02,085
只要我一恢复体力  
As soon as I get my strength back

373
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:05,028
就带你们去那
I will take us back there.

374
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:08,001
我们要把我儿子救回来
And we are gonna get my boy back.

375
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:33,019
你是对的
You were right.

376
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:37,012
什么对的  
Right about what?

377
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,045
关于Henry
About Henry.

378
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:44,002
你和Sayid当初如何对待他
What you and Sayid did to him when you first found him

379
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:47,062
你...你做得对
you were right.

380
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:49,062
我虽然不欣赏你的处理方式,
I don't like how you did it

381
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:53,095
但我不该阻止你们
but I shouldn't have gotten in your way.

382
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:57,039
当然你做了你觉得是对的事情
you did what you thought was right

383
00:28:57,042 --> 00:29:00,062
尽管你是当时这么觉得  Jack.
at the time you thought it, Jack.

384
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:03,095
我只希望下次你在决定做什么事之前,
I just hope the next time you decide to do something

385
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:05,055
请先让我知道
you include me.

386
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:12,005
直觉告诉我  你现在就有话要和我说
And something tells me that's gonna be soon.

387
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:14,032
你听到Michael说的话了
You heard Michael.

388
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:15,082
我们能救他们
We can take them.

389
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:19,045
我们那位大胡子朋友告诫我们不要越过底线
Our friend with the beard told us not to cross the line.

390
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,049
John  这些人都是骗子
These people are liars, John.

391
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:24,049
该死的  我们为什么要这么迷信他们  
Why the hell should we take their word on anything?

392
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:28,045
我完全同意
I couldn't agree more.

393
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,009
那么...
So,

394
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:33,099
现在怎么办  
now what?

395
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,092
你们去哪  
Where are you going?

396
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:41,019
从Sawyer那要回枪
To get our guns back from Sawyer.

397
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:43,055
我们需要你去说服他
We're gonna need you to help convince him.

398
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:45,059
谁来照顾Michael  
Who's gonna take care of Michael?

399
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:47,012
我留下吧
I'll stay.

400
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:49,032
-你们去吧  -确定没问题吗  
-You guys go ahead.  -You sure?

401
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:51,079
替我向Sawyer问好
Give Sawyer my best.

402
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:54,029
好的  我们很快就回来
All right. We'll be back soon.

403
00:30:03,045 --> 00:30:06,039
小心头  就快到了
Watch your head. Almost there.

404
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,039
看过"the flintstones"吗  
You ever watch The Flintstones?

405
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:09,092
当然  
Sure

406
00:30:09,095 --> 00:30:12,092
我在医院的时候一直看
I used to watch it all the time when I was in the hospital.

407
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:15,089
因为把屁股弄伤了
When I broke my hip.

408
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:18,039
那你有没有注意过Fred是如何判断
Did you ever notice how Fred would run

409
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:20,009
一遍又一遍地重复走过同一个地方  
by the same thing over and over again?

410
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:23,062
这已经是第三次路过这棵树了
Third time past this tree.

411
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:28,012
那不是同一颗树
That's a different tree.

412
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:33,018
Hurley  如果你迷路的话没有关系的
Hurley, it's OK if you're lost.

413
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:35,065
老兄  我没有迷路  你要相信我
Dude, I'm not lost. Will you trust me?

414
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:37,095
我们马上就要漫步于
We're right about to walk

415
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:41,015
这个岛上最最神秘的沙滩上了
onto the most excellent secret beach on the island

416
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:43,085
看  够惊喜吧
and... surprise!

417
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:48,035
Hurley

418
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,085
这是我们的沙滩
this is our beach.

419
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,089
Jin在那里
There's Jin.

420
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:01,095
你想过没有 为什么不在这儿野餐呢  
I tell you what, why not have the picnic here?

421
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:03,072
来吧,把毯子给我
Come on, give me the blankets.

422
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:06,029
毯子  
Blankets?

423
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:09,005
你没有带毯子  
You don't have any blankets?

424
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:12,059
饮料带了吗  
How about drinks?

425
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:17,092
好吧  这样吧  我去搞定毯子
OK, I tell you what, I will handle the blankets

426
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,092
你去找Rose还有Bernard
you just track down Rose and Bernard.

427
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:22,045
我看到他们拿了酒
I saw them pull wine from the pallet.

428
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,022
好吗  
OK?

429
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:28,005
酒
Oh. Wine.

430
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:30,099
很棒
Groovy.

431
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:32,089
也许喝多后  
maybe if I get drunk enough

432
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,092
我会记起你从哪来
I'll remember where I know you from.

433
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:37,052
或许吧
Yeah.

434
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:39,059
好的
OK.

435
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:56,050
Sawyer

436
00:31:58,072 --> 00:32:00,019
把书放下
Put the book down.

437
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,019
这可不是书  这是手稿
It's not a book, it's a manuscript.

438
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,015
我将是第一个 也是唯一一个
I'm about to be the first and only guy

439
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:05,099
幸运儿知道作者的人
to find out "whodunit".

440
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:08,062
我明白了  你们都很有空
I think I got it figured out, so cool your damn jets

441
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:11,002
在椰树旁闲逛
and walk around the coconut trees.

442
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:12,099
还剩10页没看完了
I got ten pages left.

443
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:17,089
想知道吗  
Want to figure it out?

444
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:25,019
你发什么神经啊  
What the hell is your problem, Doc?

445
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:27,029
是时候把枪还给我们了
It's time to give us the guns back.

446
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:29,069
你烧了书的结局
You burn the ending of my book...

447
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,055
-东西在哪  James  -你说呢  
-Where are they, James?  -You too, Brutus?

448
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:34,025
带我们去吧  Sawyer  好吗  
Just take us there. All right?

449
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:37,009
-别再耍花样了  -你带她来可怜我  
-Quit playing around.  What? -You bring her along for a sympathy vote?

450
00:32:37,012 --> 00:32:39,065
我对她已经没有感觉了  医生
She ain't in my head, Doc

451
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:42,015
你们俩何不到林子里玩去  
so why don't you two just go play in the jungle?

452
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:45,035
带我们去拿枪  现在就去
Take us to the guns. Now.

453
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:53,079
那个贱人
Oh, that bitch.

454
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:56,039
她偷了我的枪
She stole my damn gun.

455
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:59,019
Ana Lucia.

456
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:00,079
她要枪干什么  
Why would she need a gun?

457
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:02,095
这个小贱人
Son of a bitch!

458
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:06,052
Jack...

459
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:12,032
我有话和你说
I need to tell you something.

460
00:33:21,055 --> 00:33:23,072
捡起来
Pick it up.

461
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:32,022
自己松绑
Cut yourself loose.

462
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:34,025
什么  
What?

463
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:37,002
照我说的做
Just do it.

464
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:41,009
为什么  
Why?

465
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:43,045
你知道为什么
You know why.

466
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:09,059
他老说你误解了
He kept saying you were misunderstood.

467
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:12,009
你说什么  
What are you talking about?

468
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:14,002
Goodwin.

469
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:18,039
是的  他说了你的一切  Ana
Yes. He told us all about you, Ana.

470
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,095
他觉得能够改变你有多值得
How he thought you were worthy, that he could change you.

471
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:31,069
但他错了
But he was wrong.

472
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,095
他为此而送了命
And it cost him his life.

473
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,042
他要杀我
He was gonna kill me.

474
00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:57,042
他吗  
Was he?

475
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,022
说够了没  
Are you done?

476
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:08,059
是的  Ana  说完了
Yes, Ana. I'm done.

477
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:20,009
我这就完结了  对吗  
So, this is it, huh?

478
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:23,025
是的  Henry
Yes, Henry.

479
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:25,015
了结了
This is it.

480
00:35:32,015 --> 00:35:34,065
请听我说  好吗
I want you to listen to me, okay

481
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,080
因为我要你帮我个忙
because I will ask you a favor

482
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,065
我还没来得及换上参加父亲葬礼的衣服 就出现在你面前了
Chrissy, I'm standing in front of you in the same suit that I'm wearing to my father's funeral

483
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,067
我想请你帮个忙
and I'm asking you a favor.

484
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,014
我要在16小时内赶到洛杉矶
In 16 hours I need to land at LAX.

485
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:47,084
我还要棺材通过海关安检
I need that coffin to clear Customs

486
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:50,077
因为有灵车在那等着
because there will be a hearse waiting.

487
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,070
我要那灵车带着我和棺材
And I need that hearse to take me and that coffin

488
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:56,064
去墓地下葬  为什么  
to a cemetery. Why,

489
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:59,010
chrissy  为什么不能让我带他回家入土
Chrissy? Why can't I just bring him to a funeral home

490
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,097
并安排所有的相关事宜  
and make all the arrangements?

491
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,097
为什么我就不能在时限内搞定  
Why can't I really take my time with it?

492
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,027
因为... 因为我要安顿好一切
Because...Because I need it to be done.

493
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,000
我要个终结
I need it to be over.

494
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,064
我只不过...
I just...

495
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:15,080
我只想安葬我父亲
I need to bury my father

496
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:29,024
有架飞机
That was an airplane.

497
00:36:29,027 --> 00:36:32,027
不  我不在工作  我在悉尼
No, I'm not at work. I'm in Sydney.

498
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,064
对  澳大利亚
That's right. Australia.

499
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,070
我...
I...

500
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:44,070
我不知道  我...
I don't know, I...

501
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:53,034
我犯了个错误  妈妈
I made a mistake, Mom.

502
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:59,057
你知道的  所以我只能尽快远离你
You knew, so I got as far away from you as I could.

503
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:07,054
但是现在...
But now...

504
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:13,010
我想回家  妈妈
I wanna come home, Mommy.

505
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,037
那就回来吧
So come home.

506
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:27,064
我乘大洋航空
I'm on Oceanic Flight

507
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:31,084
815航班
815.

508
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:38,010
我会来接你的
I'll be there when you land, mija.

509
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:56,037
人都去哪了  
Where is everybody?

510
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,054
你的话让他们忙活开了
What you said got them worked up.

511
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:01,087
他们去找Sawyer要回所有的枪
They went to get all the guns back from Sawyer.

512
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,050
Sawyer

513
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:09,014
所有的枪都在Sawyer那
Sawyer has all the guns?

514
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:13,010
说来话长
Long story.

515
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,097
至少你这支他就没有
At least he didn't get that one.

516
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,054
对的
Yeah.

517
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:23,044
但糟糕的是  我不能用它
Too bad I can't use it.

518
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:26,087
用来干什么  
Use it on what?

519
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,020
我们抓住了一个人
We caught one of them.

520
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:31,057
他们中的一个人
The Others.

521
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,054
他被关在那里
He's locked up in there.

522
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,004
有多久了...
How long has he...

523
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:40,064
一个多星期
Over a week.

524
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,017
你负责守护他  
And you're, what, taking care of him?

525
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,004
今天他想杀我
He tried to kill me today.

526
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:53,074
所以我要他死
So I wanted him dead.

527
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,060
但我做不到
I couldn't do it.

528
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:11,050
我就是下不了手
I couldn't even kill him.

529
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:19,070
我看着他
I looked at him, and he...

530
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:29,097
我怎么也做不到
I can't do this anymore.

531
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,050
那么让我来吧
Then let me do it.

532
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,004
他们都是禽兽
They're animals.

533
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:55,050
我亲眼看到他们的所作所为  他们真是禽兽不如
I've seen these people and they are animals.

534
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,067
他们从我手上抢走了我的儿子
They took my son. Right out of my hands.

535
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,070
他们抢走了我的儿子  还...
They took my son, and...

536
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,040
给我枪  我来
I'll do it. Give me the gun.

537
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,044
我杀了他
I'll kill him.

538
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,014
因为他们就是这么做的
'Cause that's what they'd do.

539
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:23,010
密码是多少  
What's the combination?

540
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:31,010
右转18...
18 right.

541
00:40:32,094 --> 00:40:34,097
左转1...
1 left.

542
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,077
右转31
31 right.

543
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,030
对不起
I'm sorry.

544
00:40:58,034 --> 00:41:00,040
为什么  
For what?

545
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,077
Michael

546
