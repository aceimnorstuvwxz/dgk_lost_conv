57
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,078
现在就走  快的话...明天午夜可以到
We leave now, move fast, middle of the night tomorrow.

58
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:37,023
听着  他们还不知道他们被我发现了
They have no idea I know where they are.

59
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:40,064
他们不会有准备的 所以我们带上枪就可以走了
They won't be expecting us. So we get the guns and we go.

60
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:43,047
-现在就走  就我们五个   -不不  五个不够
-Right now, just the five of us.  -No. Five's not enough.

61
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:45,072
你说他们至少有20个人 他们拿走了我们的枪
You said there's at least 20 of them with our guns.

62
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:47,056
而且我们还不确定你看到的是不是...
We're not sure if what you saw was...

63
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:49,086
我知道我看到了什么
Hey, I know what I saw.

64
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:52,006
我们带太多的人  他们就会知道我们来了
We take too many people, they'll hear us coming.

65
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:54,025
我不会带一支军队横穿这个岛的  Jack
I'm not taking a damn army across the island.

66
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,094
Michael  你肯定你可以

76
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,066
我们今晚葬了他们  然后...

77
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:44,086

00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:11,053

你是Walt的爸爸  不是么?
You're Walt's old man, aren't you?

88
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:22,062
什么?
What?

89
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:37,004
你在干什么?  我们需要他
What are you doing? We need him.

90
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,025
把他套起来
Bag him, quick.

91
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:48,031
他的朋友就在我们后面
His friends are right behind us.

92
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,089
今天

93
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:07,057
你好
Hello.

94
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,086
我没听见你进来  伙计
I didn't hear you come in, man.

95
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:12,003
我把鞋子放外面了
I left my shoes outside.

96
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:14,077
它们很脏
They were muddy.

97
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:19,035
你找到他了么?  Henry
Did you find him? Henry?

98
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:22,048
没有
No.

99
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:32,096
我听说你是个牧师
I hear you're a priest.

100
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,074
是的
Yes.

101
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:39,080
那我猜你是相信有地狱了
Guess you believe in hell, then.

102
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:46,033
我为英格兰的一个小教区做过一段时间
For a brief time, I served in a small parish in England.

103
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:49,010
每个周日集会后
Every Sunday after Mass

104
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,060
我都会看到一个小男孩等在教堂的后面
I would see a young boy waiting at the back of the church.

105
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,053
然后有一天  他向我忏悔
And then, one day, the boy confessed to me

106
00:08:55,053 --> 00:09:01,075
他用铁铲把他的狗打死了
that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel.

107
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:08,026
他说那条狗在咬她妹妹的屁股
And he said the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek

108
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:12,067
他得保护她
and he needed to protect her.

109
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:17,028
他想知道他会不会为这事而入地狱
And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this.

110
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:21,047
我告诉他说上帝会理解的
I told him that God would understand.

111
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:25,013
他会被宽恕的...
That he would be forgiven

112
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:29,020
就像他现在感到难过一样
as long as he was sorry.

113
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:33,094
但是这个男孩不在乎宽恕
But the boy did not care about forgiveness.

114
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:39,042
他只是害怕如果他真的入了地狱...
He was only afraid that if he did go to hell

115
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:44,044
那条狗会在那等他
that dog would be there waiting for him.

116
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,035
你还好吧?
You all right?

117
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:20,021
我没事
Yeah.

118
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,088
我正要回去再给你查查
I was coming back to check on you.

119
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,010
好的  伙计
Yeah, man.

120
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,084
我得离开那
I had to get out of there.

121
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,092
因为...
I just...

122
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:31,086
我得带回我的孩子
I have to get my son back.

123
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:34,051
我们会帮你的  Michael
We're gonna help you do that, Michael.

124
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,063
必须要按我说的做  伙计
It's gotta be the way I said, man.

125
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:38,001
就我们五个
Just the five of us.

126
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:41,000
否则就不行了  不行了
Otherwise it won't work. It won't work.

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,036
我保证  我们会想出办法的
We're gonna figure that out.

128
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:44,064
我已经有一个办法了
I have already figured it out.

129
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,089
就是这些知道这事的人
It's gotta be just the people who already know.

130
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,091
你  我  Kate  Sawyer  Hurley  就这样
You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley. That's it.

131
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:54,005
其他的人...会使我的处境更加危险
Anybody else...Look, it puts him in more danger.

132
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,070
你别乱定主意了
You don't get to decide this.

133
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:01,020
是我儿子的事  由我来决定
It's my son. It's my call.

134
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,061
事情只能是这样的
And that's the way it has to be.

135
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:14,077
那就这样吧
Then that's the way it'll be.

136
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:31,006
Hey, Aaron.

137
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:34,037
大家伙
Hey, big guy.

138
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:39,014
有看到Eko么?
Have you seen Eko?

139
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:41,099
没有
No.

140
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:48,005
你知道  我们在建一座教堂
You know, we're building a church.

141
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:52,014
你有事么  Charlie?
Is there something you want, Charlie?

142
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:55,031
是的
Yeah.

143
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:57,018
我在降落伞那找到了这个
I found something in the pallet

144
00:11:57,018 --> 00:12:00,093
我想你会用得到
I thought you might need.

145
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,021
疫苗?
Vaccine?

146
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:06,058
我不知道我们要疫苗来做什么
I don't know what we need vaccine for

147
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,098
但我想如果有人需要的话
but if anyone should have it

148
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:11,001
只有你和你的孩子了
you and the baby should.

149
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:12,064
没事的  这是...
It's all right.

150
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,019
这是空气注射器
It's a pneumatic injector.

151
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,082
你只要...
You just

152
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:19,040
你把它插进你的腿里  然后...
put it into your leg, and...

153
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,052
疫苗就进去了
It goes right in.

154
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:22,069
一点都不痛  真的
Quite painless, really.

155
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,037
你好像很在行
You seem to know a lot about it.

156
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:27,099
我试过了
I tried it.

157
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:31,061
给你和你孩子前我想确保它没问题
I wanted to make sure it was safe before giving it to you and the baby.

158
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:34,007
你感觉怎样?  我是说  它有效么?
how do you feel? I mean, did it do anything?

159
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,078
它...它有效么?
What did it do?

160
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,055
我不知道  我感觉很好
I don't know. I feel fine.

161
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:39,089
反正这说了
Anyway, it says

162
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:43,034
你应该每隔九天注射一次
you're supposed to give yourself a shot every nine days.

163
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:45,034
好么?  这里的量足够
All right? So, I mean, there's enough here

164
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:48,051
你和你的孩子用一段时间了
for you and the baby for a while.

165
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:51,041
就这些了
That's it.

166
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:55,045
好了
All right

167
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,048
-我把它放在...  -好的
-I'll put it...  -Yeah.

168
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,078
谢谢
Thank you.

169
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,036
不客气
Welcome.

170
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:02,052
我要给他吃东西了  所以...
I should really feed him.

171
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:04,066
好的  Claire?
Yeah. Hey, Claire

172
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:07,072
你想也许我和你...我想...
do you think maybe you and I could?

173
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:11,013
天哪
Oh, my God.

174
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:15,009
Michael回来了
Michael's back.

175
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:31,049
Michael?

176
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,071
是Michael
Look, there's Michael!

177
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:57,098
恩  很好很好  见到你很高兴
Uh, yeah, yeah. It's good to see you, too.

178
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,047
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

179
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:03,091
是的  我...只是...
Yeah. I'm...

180
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:07,000
我很好
I'm fine.

181
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:25,040
是谁?
Who?

182
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,067
Ana Lucia和Libby
Ana Lucia and Libby.

183
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:32,048
发生了什么事?
What happened to them?

184
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:38,001
他们被杀了
They were murdered.

185
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:45,014
13天前

186
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:57,099
好啊  Michael
Hey, there, Michael.

187
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,029
别跟自己较劲了
Not gonna hold that against you.

188
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:09,009
我带走了你的孩子  这样就算扯平了  别再这么做了好吧?
Fair's fair. I took your boy. But don't do that again, OK?

189
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,018
他在哪?  你这狗娘养的
Where is he, you son of a bitch?

190
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:16,002
看看我找到了谁  她一直跟着她的朋友
Hey, looky what I found. She was following her friends.

191
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,054
跟在我们后面半公里处
They're about half a click behind us.

192
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:22,019
你一旦发出声音...
You make one sound...

193
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,074
你就永远看不到你的儿子了
you'll never see your boy again.

194
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:28,027
塞住他
Gag him.

195
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,087
把火把准备好
Get ready with the torches.

196
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:33,070
我要和她的朋友们谈谈
I'm gonna go talk to her people.

197
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:41,006
-我想我们最好回去  -什么?
-I think we'd better head back.  -What?

198
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,015
-快找痕迹吧  John  -我找不到了
-Find the trail, John.  -I've lost it.

199
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:46,052
你不是找不到  你只是不想找到他
You don't just lose a trail. You just don't want to find him.

200
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:48,022
就是这样  Jack
That's right.

201
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,042
我一路穿过丛林
I've been running through the jungle

202
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,074
追着枪声而来
toward the sound of gunfire

203
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,026
因为我一点也不在乎Michael
because I don't care about Michael.

204
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:55,012
你知道我们现在就回头会发生什么么?
You know what happens if we turn around and go back?

205
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:58,091
我们就再也见不到他了 全是因为我们
We're never gonna see him again. And that's gonna be on us.

206
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,094
因为你和我
On you and on me.

207
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:06,034
你说得很对  Jack
You're exactly right, Jack.

208
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:08,006
你是谁?
Who are you?

209
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:10,031
他就是在救生筏上开枪打我的人
He's the son of a bitch that shot me on the raft.

210
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:14,037
干吗不把枪放下呢?
Why don't you point the gun down?

211
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:20,081
没事的  他只是在传达信息
It's OK. He's just delivering a message.

212
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:24,028
他得吓吓你的朋友
He has to scare your friends to do it.

213
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:25,082
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

214
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:27,031
你不相信什么?
You don't believe what?

215
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:29,072
我认为我们的人比你们的多
I think there's more of us than there are of you.

216
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,046
这个理论很有趣
That's an interesting theory.

217
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:36,038
亮火把
Light them up!

218
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:42,020
把武器给我  转身  回去吧
Give me your weapons, turn around, go home.

219
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,005
不
No.

220
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,092
我本不想这样的
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

221
00:16:47,092 --> 00:16:51,051
把她带上来  Alex
Bring her out, Alex.

222
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:53,066
你去吧
Go on.

223
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,075
-你...  -拜托  Alex
-You.  -Come on, Alex.

224
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:58,081
求你了
Please?

225
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:05,092
我们走  快快
Let's go. Up. Up.

226
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:12,026
Claire还好吧?
Is Claire OK?

227
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:16,022
她的孩子生了么?  没事吧?
Did she have the baby? Is it OK?

228
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:20,033
是男的还是女的?
Is it a boy or a girl?

229
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:25,038
就像我说的  她很好奇...
Like I said, curiosity.

230
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:37,075
我和你还没完  Zeke
You and me ain't done, Zeke.

231
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:58,042
他的朋友们回去了
His friends are going home.

232
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:01,048
打晕他
Divvy them up.

233
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:13,018
对不起
Sorry.

234
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:16,096
今天

235
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:42,070
看见了么  医生
Hey. What do you say, Doc?

236
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,038
我认为爱尔兰人只在有人死了的时候才喝酒
And here I was thinking the Irish drink when somebody dies.

237
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:48,024
我不是爱尔兰人
I'm not Irish.

238
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:51,085
我也不是
Neither am I.

239
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:55,067
丛林里发生了什么?
So what happened out there in the jungle?

240
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,089
就像他说的一样  他找到了营地...
Exactly what he said. He found the camp...

241
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:02,094
我不是在说Mike  你和那个小妞...
I ain't talking about Mike. You and Freckles.

242
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:06,054
在你找到他前  你们消失了整整一晚上
Before you found him. You were gone all night.

243
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:09,062
我们被网住了
We got caught in a net.

244
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:11,034
那是什么意思?
What's the hell's that supposed to mean?

245
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:15,095
那说明我们被网住了
It means we got caught in a net.

246
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:20,005
就像这些天他们所说的一样?
That what they're calling it these days?

247
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:24,068
是真的么?  Henry逃了?
Is it true? Henry is gone?

248
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:25,058
是的
Yeah.

249
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:26,060
有人在追他么?
Who's going after him?

250
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,035
Locke和Eko在半夜里去追了
Locke and Eko went in the night.

251
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,031
但是到现在还没看到他们回来
We ain't seen either of them since.

252
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:32,083
这些是枪  对吧? 拿来做什么?
Those are the guns? What are you doing with them?

253
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:36,028
你认为呢?  该是结束一切的时候了
What do you think we're doing? It's time to finish this.

254
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:38,021
-你们什么时候动身?  -天亮就走
-When do we leave?  -In the morning.

255
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,055
你不用去  Sayid
You're not coming, Sayid.

256
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,036
什么?
Excuse me?

257
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:45,081
Michael不想人太多... 就我  Kate  Hurley 和...
Michael wants to keep it small. Me, Kate, Hurley

258
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,063
和他
and him.

259
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:50,048
没错  "他"说连长袜子皮皮和那见鬼的葡萄猩猩
Well even though Pippi Longstocking and the damned Grape Ape

260
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:52,040
都能成为这次该死行动的理想候选人
are ideal candidates for The Dirty Dozen

261
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,062
我看干吗不带上Sayid呢
we might wanna bring the Red Beret.

262
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:57,070
都由Michael说了算  他知道我们要去哪
It's Michael's call. He knows where we're going.

263
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:04,006
不由他说了算  Jack  我们说了算
It is not his call, Jack. It's ours.

264
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:09,071
欢迎加入
Welcome aboard.

265
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:59,061
那么...你半夜醒来
So... you wake up in the middle of the night

266
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:02,036
抓起你的耶稣棒然后跑进丛林
grab your Jesus stick, and race off into the jungle.

267
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:05,028
没叫我  也没留字条
You don't call, you don't write...

268
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:07,092
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,060
我有事要做
I had work to do.

270
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,017
好的好的
Right. Yeah.

271
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:17,089
Charlie  能帮我个忙么?
Charlie, would you do me a favor?

272
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,024
我希望你能把我在海滩上的东西带来
I was hoping you could bring my things from the beach here.

273
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:25,015
为什么?
What for?

274
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:27,062
你要搬来这住?
You moving in here?

275
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:30,040
你想要你自己的小单人间?
Fancy yourself a little bachelor pad?

276
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,021
是的  我要搬到这里来
Yes, I am moving in here.

277
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:37,095
那么教堂怎么办?
what about the church?

278
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,089
我说我们要一起建的  伙计
You said we were supposed to be building it together.

279
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:46,017
我现在有其他事要做了
I am supposed to do something different now.

280
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:54,053
我应该怎么办?
And what am I supposed to do?

281
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:58,075
把我的东西带来
Bring me my things.

282
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:02,059
你自己去拿吧
ring your own things.

283
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,023
Charlie  拜托
Charlie, please.

284
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,071
你最好快点去拿  伙计
You'd better leg it, mate.

285
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:10,016
表可不会停下来等你
Clock's ticking.

286
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:24,014
有好消息要告诉你
Got some good news for you.

287
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:25,074
阿拉伯船长也加入我们了
Captain Arab's in, too.

288
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:27,099
日出时出发
Cavalry rides at sunrise.

289
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,011
你告诉了Sayid?
You told Sayid?

290
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:31,026
是的  我和Sayid说了
Yeah, I told Sayid.

291
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:33,095
你不能说的
You shouldn't have done that.

292
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:35,051
是么  我很抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

293
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:36,084
我只是觉得  如果我们是去打仗
I figured if we're going to war

294
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:39,076
我们需要一个参加过战争的人
we'd want the one guy who's been in a war.

295
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:43,032
这有问题么?
That a problem?

296
00:22:44,027 --> 00:22:46,093
恩  没有
No.

297
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:49,075
没有问题
It's not a problem.

298
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:52,095
那么不就行了
All right, then.

299
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,014
11天前

300
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:11,020
放开我
Get off of me.

301
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,083
你有问题么  Michael?
You got a problem, Michael?

302
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:16,059
你们逼着我走了一天一夜没有休息了
You march me a day and night without any rest, yeah.

303
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,083
我太累了
My problem is I'm tired.

304
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,000
我还想把你打晕了扛着走的
I'd offer to knock you out and carry you

305
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,055
但是我们到了
but we're here.

306
00:24:07,084 --> 00:24:11,018
把他放到那去
Put him right over here.

307
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,066
告诉他我们到了
Tell her we're here.

308
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,025
可能会有点疼
I can't promise this won't hurt.

309
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:29,070
那是... 该死
What the? Ow! Damn it.

310
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,079
放松点  只是取点血
Relax. Just taking some blood.

311
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,072
取血干什么?  你们是谁?
Taking some blood? For what? Who are you people?

312
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:37,014
我儿子在哪?
Where's my son?

313
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:40,026
好了
That's it. All done.

314
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:46,075
看看结果如何了
See you in the funny pages.

315
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:51,014
你好  Micheal
Hello, Michael.

316
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:52,058
我儿子在哪?
Where's my son?

317
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:56,037
我叫Klugh
My name is Miss Klugh.

318
00:24:56,073 --> 00:25:02,069
我希望你能回答我几个问题...
I was hoping you might help me answer some questions.

319
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:05,029
是关于Walt的
About Walt.

320
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:06,057
他在哪?
Where is he?

321
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:09,081
他是你的亲生儿子么?
Is he your biological son?

322
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,059
什么?
What?

323
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,026
你是他父亲么?
Are you his father?

324
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:17,053
他几岁开始说话的?
How old was he when he started speaking?

325
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:19,018
我...他...
I... He...

326
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,073
他成长过程中有生病么?  头痛?
Did he have any illnesses growing up? Headaches?

327
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:22,094
经常性昏迷?
Fainting spells?

328
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:26,047
什么?  没有
What? No.

329
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,043
我不知...我不在那  他离我半个地球远
I don't... I wasn't there. He was halfway around the world.

330
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:32,060
你为什么问我这些? 
Why are you asking me?

331
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:40,092
Walt有没曾经出现在不可能出现的地方?
Did Walt ever appear in a place he wasn't supposed to be?

332
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:46,025
你说他离你有半个地球远  但是...
You say he was halfway around the world

333
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:48,031
-你有看见...  -我要我的儿子
-but did you see...  -I want my son.

334
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:51,052
你马上把他带来见我
You bring him to me right now.

335
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:55,061
我要见我儿子
I wanna see my boy.

336
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:02,005
对于一个如此想要回自己儿子的人来说...
For someone who wants his son back so badly

337
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:07,060
你对他并不是太了解  Michael
you don't seem to know much about him, Michael.

338
00:26:15,097 --> 00:26:19,075
今天

339
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:28,056
你不用去
You're not coming.

340
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:29,078
欢迎回来  Michael
Welcome back, Michael.

341
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:31,057
听着  我知道Sawyer和你说了  好了
Look, I know Sawyer told you.

342
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:34,038
但是  这样不行的
But it's not gonna work.

343
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:35,029
你不能去
You're not coming.

344
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,037
为什么我不能去?
And why is it that I'm not coming?

345
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:41,004
因为你是要去追那个逃跑的人
Because you're going after the guy who escaped

346
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:43,037
而我是要去找我儿子
and I'm going after my son.

347
00:26:43,037 --> 00:26:47,026
你是不是说我的报复心胜过对于Walt安全的担心?
Are you implying I'd let a desire for revenge compromise Walt's safety?

348
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:50,015
我是说由我来决定谁去谁留下
I'm implying that I decide who stays and who goes

349
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:53,079
你留下
and you stay.

350
00:26:58,078 --> 00:27:04,049
我知道你想帮忙  是么?
I know you wanna help, right?

351
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:09,049
但是我需要按我的方式来做
But I gotta do this my way.

352
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:21,071
当然
Of course.

353
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:27,047
祝你好运  Michael
Good luck, Michael.

354
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:31,076
好的  谢谢
Yeah. Thanks.

355
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:47,027
该死的
Bloody hell.

356
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:03,000
你没开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding me?

357
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:07,066
有人让你这么做的么?
Did someone put you up to this?

358
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,057
Vincent?

359
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:52,054
你们应该早就回来的
You were supposed to come right back.

360
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:56,086
你们整夜都在丛林里  怎么了?
You were out all night. What happened?

361
00:29:56,095 --> 00:30:01,017
我们无法发现Henry的行踪
We were unable to find Henry's trail.

362
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:04,064
是的  我知道了
Yeah, I got that.

363
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:06,050
Lock在哪?
Where's Locke?

364
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:10,028
我不知道
I do not know.

365
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:16,089
我们在日落时安葬Ana Lucia和Libby
We're burying Ana Lucia and Libby at sunset.

366
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:19,004
谢谢
Thank you.

367
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:23,030
我以我自己的方式来悼念他们
I will mourn them in my own way.

368
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:39,069
由谁来说?
Who's gonna talk?

369
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:41,005
什么?
What?

370
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,014
在葬礼上
At the funeral.

371
00:30:43,014 --> 00:30:45,037
由谁来说?
Who's gonna talk?

372
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:49,006
我肯定Hurley想说些和Libby有关的
I'm sure Hurley'll wanna say something about Libby.

373
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:53,025
我甚至不知道她的姓
I never even knew her last name.

374
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,076
Ana Lucia

375
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:59,025
她姓Cortez
It was Cortez.

376
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:02,051
Cortez

377
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:05,081
我知道了
Well, there you go.

378
00:31:13,023 --> 00:31:16,044
我和她干过了
I screwed her.

379
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:19,024
什么?
What?

380
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:21,001
她就是这么拿走我的枪的
It's how she got my gun. Ana.

381
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:25,072
她主动要和我来的
She jumped me.

382
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:30,019
我们被网住了
We got caught in a net.

383
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:39,021
你为什么告诉我这些  Sawyer?
Why are you telling me this?

384
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:50,096
因为你是唯一可以算作我朋友的人  医生
Because you're about the closest thing I got to a friend, Doc.

385
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:56,049
因为她死了
And because she's gone.

386
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:06,030
至少我们可以去杀几个人了
at least now we get to kill somebody.

387
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:36,098
Jack和你说过我们的计划了么?

什么计划?
What plan?

389
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:40,018
我们明早动身
We're leaving first thing tomorrow.

390
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:44,040
横穿岛屿到他们营地去

391
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,014
好的

为什么我要去?
Why would I wanna go?

394
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:56,086
因为他们杀了她
Because they killed her.

395
00:32:56,086 --> 00:33:00,026
Michael  别说了
Michael, come on.

396
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:03,097
你说呢  Hugo?

397
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:12,091
对于Walt我很抱歉  伙计 但是我不去

-You're sorry about...  -Michael.

399
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:39,040
3天前

401

你一直在问我问题
You have been asking me questions

407
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:32,073
我都答不上来
I don't know the answers to for a week.

408
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,088
我甚至不能肯定我儿子还活着  而且...
I don't even think my son is alive.

409
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:37,044
他还活着  Michael
He is alive, Michael.

410
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:41,009
他现在就站在外面
He's standing outside right now.

411
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:44,005
你认为我是傻子么?

412
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:48,009
你来这里后发生了一些事情  Michael
There's been a development since you came here, Michael.

413

一个我们的人被你们抓了

415
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:55,035
我们做不到
We can't do that.

416
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:59,011
但是你可以
But you can.

417

418
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:09,091
我们就放了你和Walt

419

我要见我儿子

00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:46,099
你们有三分钟时间
You have three minutes.

426
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,030
Walt

427

爸爸
Dad.

428
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:56,039
放开他

429
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:59,018
-放开他  马上放开他   -爸爸  不要
-Let him go. Get your hands off him right now.  -Dad, don't.

430
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:02,083
你还好么?
Are you OK?

431
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:04,062
是的
Yeah.

432
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:08,068
他们有伤害你么?
Are you... Did they hurt you?

433
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:11,051
他们拿我做试验
They make me take tests.

434
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:12,034
他们拿你做什么?
They make you what?

435
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:16,046
我们不谈那个
We're not gonna talk about that.

436
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:18,034
Vincent还好么?
How's Vincent?

437
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:21,090
Vincent...它很好
Vincent's...He's great.

438
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,055
它很好  它很想你
He's great. He misses you.

439
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:26,038
别怕  伙计
Hey, don't be scared, man.

440
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:27,050
别害怕
Don't be scared.

441
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,018
马上就会没事的  好么?
It's gonna be over real soon.

442
00:36:29,018 --> 00:36:30,086
我会带你离开这里的  好么?
I'm gonna get you out.

443
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,018
他们不像他们所说的...
They're not who they say they are.

444
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:34,011
你想我再把你关进那个房间么?
Want me to put you in the room?

445
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:36,023
假装?  假装什么?
Pretending? Pretending what?

446
00:36:36,023 --> 00:36:37,032
好了  就这样了
OK, that's it. We're done.

447
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:39,005
不不不不  等等  嘿  等等
No, wait. Hey, wait, wait.

448
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:41,002
过来  Walt  等等  过来  等等
Come here, Walt. Wait,

449
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:42,023
-过来  -爸爸
-come here.  -Dad

450
00:36:42,023 --> 00:36:46,052
别离开我  帮帮我 求你了  别离开我
don't leave me. Help me, please. Don't leave me.

451
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:48,099
我不会的  伙计  我会把你带走的  好么?
I won't, man. I'm gonna get you out of here, OK?

452
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:49,080
我保证
I promise you.

453
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,068
-我会把你从这里带走的  -爸爸  爸爸
-I will get you out.  -Dad! Dad!

454
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:55,006
-放开他  放开他  -我爱你
-Let him go! Walt, wait! Let go of him!  -I love you!

455

-Walt  我会把你带走的   -我爱你
-Walt, I'm gonna get you out of here.  -I love you!

456
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:59,099
-我也爱你  Walt  -放开我  放开我
-I love you too, Walt.  -Put me down! Let me go!

457
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,099
-我会把你带走的   -爸爸
-I'll get you...  -Dad!

458
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:24,096
在你放了我们的人之后
After you release our man

459
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:29,054
我还要你做些事
I'm gonna need you to do something else.

460
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,052
随便你
I'll do it. I'll do whatever you want.

461
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:41,042
我写了四个名字...四个你朋友的名字
I'm writing four names down. Four of your friends.

462
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:45,080
我们要你带他们来这
We need you to bring them here.

463
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,054
你只需要带这四个人  Michael
You have to bring only these four people, Michael.

464
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:53,095
就他们
Just them.

465
00:37:53,095 --> 00:38:00,012
如果你不能把名单上的四个人都带来...
If you don't bring all the people on the list...

466
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:04,075
你永远也见不到Walt了
you'll never see Walt again.

467
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:09,004
好的  好的
OK. OK. OK.

468
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:15,002
你听懂了么  Michael?
Do you understand, Michael?

469
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,052
我该怎么和他们说?
Yes. What do I tell them?

470
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:19,064
这没关系
Doesn't matter.

471
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:22,098
编一个故事
Make up a story.

472
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:28,048
他们无论听你说什么都会怒火冲天的
They'll be angry enough to believe whatever you say.

473
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:35,012
James Ford是谁?
Who's James Ford?

474
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,005
就是你知道的Sawyer
You know him as Sawyer.

475
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:39,084
你认识其他的人么?
You know the rest of them?

476
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:43,016
是的
Yeah.

477
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,025
我知道他们
I know them.

478
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,058
如果我做了这些...
If I do all this...

479
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:56,092
如果我照你说的做了...
If I do what you say.

480
00:38:56,092 --> 00:39:00,080
你就可以带回你的孩子
You'll get your son back...

481
00:39:00,097 --> 00:39:05,001
你们就都自由了
and you both go free.

482
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,078
我还要一艘船
And I want the boat.

483
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:40,009
当飞机坠毁时  我正在去洛杉矶安葬我父亲的路上
When the plane crashed, I was on my way to Los Angeles to bury my dad.

484
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:42,091
我很难过
I'm sorry to hear that.

485
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:46,016
现在看起来好像过去很久了
It seems like such a long time ago now.

486
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:50,025
我本来要从机场直接去墓地的 但是...
I was gonna go right from the airport to the cemetery, but...

487
00:40:50,025 --> 00:40:54,070
我不知道我该说些什么
I had no idea what I was gonna say.

488
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:59,029
现在又是这种时候了
And here we are again

489
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:05,025
我觉得Michael向他们妥协了
I think Michael has been compromised.

490
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:08,075
我们继续走  Jack
Let's keep walking, Jack.

491
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:10,072
你说妥协是什么意思?
What do you mean, compromised?

492
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:13,072
他的作为不像是一个讲真话的人
His actions are not those of a man telling the truth.

493
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:15,020
他为什么要向我们撒谎?
Why would he lie to us?

494
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,043
因为我相信一个父亲会为了孩子而做一切
Because I believe a father would do anything for his son.

495
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:20,089
因为我相信Henry可能是Michael放走的
Because I believe that Michael may have freed Henry,

496
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:23,068
并且我相信他要带你们去一个陷阱
and because I believe he's leading you into a trap.

497
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:25,035
你相信的太多了  Sayid
You believe a lot, Sayid.

498
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:30,042
我还相信Henry是他们中的一员
And I also believed that Henry was one of them.

499
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:36,040
好吧  我们去和他谈谈
All right. Let's go talk to him.

500
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,055
不  他必须继续以为他还掌控着大局
No. He must believe he's in control.

501
00:41:39,055 --> 00:41:40,096
我们为什么要这么做?
Why the hell would we wanna do that?

502
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:46,000
这样我们就能取得主动了
So we can create an advantage.

503
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:48,077
怎么做?
How?

504
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:51,008
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

505
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:56,003
但是我们还有一晚可以想办法
But we have one more night to figure that out.

506
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,089
Ana Lucia Cortez 是...
Ana Lucia Cortez was...

507
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:07,076
在我们坠机前  她是一个警察
Before we crashed, she was a police officer.

508
00:42:07,076 --> 00:42:10,042
我想她在这里的日子并不好过
I don't think it was easy for her being here

509
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:14,065
但是我想她是尽力了
but I think she did the best she could.

510
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,096
她是一个话很少的人
She was a woman of few words

511
00:42:15,096 --> 00:42:21,069
我会以你为榜样的
and I'm gonna follow her example.

512
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:26,020
安息吧  Ana
Rest in peace, Ana.

513
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:41,072
Libby 是...
Libby was...

514
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:46,079
她是...
She was...

515
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:54,045
Libby是一个心理医生
Libby was a psychologist.

516
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:59,098
或是一个...精神病医生
Or a psychiatrist.

517
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,055
二者其一
One of those. Either way,

518
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:07,049
她可能帮助过许多人
she probably helped a lot of people.

519
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,040
她帮助过我
She helped me.

520
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:15,033
她是我的朋友
She was my friend.

521
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:20,090
发生这种事对她来说是不公平的  绝对不
It's not fair that this happened to her. It's not.

522
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:31,041
我和你一起去
I'm going with you.

523
00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:42,016
再见  Libby
Goodbye, Libby.

524
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:12,095
船
Boat.

525
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:17,033
船
Boat.

526
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:48,050
