Locke  要是他想让我们自相残杀呢

快走  救Sawyer
Just go! Save Sawyer!

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,730
我不会丢下你

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,970
-我爱你  Sun  -我爱你

去
Yeah.

22
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,460
怎么了
Why?

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,070
你们不会觉得尴尬吧
You're not gonna get all weird, are you? 

24
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,760
-我怎么会尴尬  -那就不要
- Why would I get weird?  - Just don't get weird.

好  谢谢
Um, sure. Thanks.

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,090
感觉还好吗
How you feeling?

31
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,330
很好
Uh, pretty good.

32
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,690
只是他晚上踢得厉害
I mean, he kicks like crazy at night, so...

33
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,620
我是Jack Shephard
Jack Shephard.

34
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,440
你好  Shephard先生
Hello, Mr. Shephard.

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,410
我是大洋航空的
Uh, this is Oceanic Airlines calling

36
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,260
想通知您
to inform you that we've, um,

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,250
我们找到您丢失的货物了
we've located your missing cargo.

38
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,150
你们找到我父亲的棺材了
My father's coffin-- you found it?

39
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,430
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,930
今晚就能送回洛杉矶
It'll be arriving in Los Angeles by the end of the day.

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,400
那实在太好了  谢谢
That's, uh, that's great news. Thank you.

42
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,370
不客气  先生
Of course, sir.

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,200
敝公司非常抱歉让您等了这么久
We at oceanic are very sorry it's taken so long.

44
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,330
再见  先生
Good day, sir.

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,940
我只能这么做
This was the best I could do,

46
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,770
而且会有点疼
And it's gonna hurt a bit.

47
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,700
子弹直接穿过身体
The bullet went straight through,

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,800
如果不缝合  很容易感染
But if I don't do this, it's gonna get infected.

49
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,160
忍着点
Okay. I'm sorry.

50
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,530
他们生了个女儿
They had a little girl, you know.

51
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,150
名字叫
Her name was...

52
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,450
Ji Yeon
Ji Yeon.

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,240
Jin都没见过她
Jin hadn't even met her yet.

54
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,790
Locke害死了他们
Locke did this to them.

55
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,630
我们得杀了他  Jack
We have to kill him, Jack.

56
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,770
我知道
I know.

57
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,280
我们该出发了
We should get going now.

58
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,560
去哪
Go where?

59
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,110
Sayid死前说Desmond在一口井里
Before Sayid died, he said that Desmond was in a well.

60
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,940
如果Locke想让Desmond死  我们就得找到他
If Locke wants Desmond dead, then we're gonna need him.

61
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,530
欢迎回来  Locke老师  真高兴见到您
Welcome back, mr. Locke. It's good to see you.

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,930
谢谢  你也是
Thank you. You, too.

63
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,270
你还敢来
Hey! Don't you dare.

64
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,330
他就是撞Locke老师的人
It's him! The guy who hit mr. Locke!

65
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,800
快打电话报警
Somebody call the police right now!

66
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,640
我看到你撞他
I saw what you did. 

67
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,080
-我要报警抓你  -别挡着我
- I'm making a citizen's arrest.  - Do not get in my way.

68
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,790
你休想
Don't you--

69
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,590
我不会再让你伤害Locke老师
I will not let you hurt mr. Locke again!

70
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,360
我不是来伤害他的  我是来
I'm not here to hurt him. I am here...

71
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,090
-帮他放手  -你是谁
- To help him let go.  - Who are you?

72
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,370
你想知道我是谁
You wanna know who I am?

73
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,690
你确定这是近路吗
You sure this is a shortcut, huh?

74
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,010
我在这里住了很久  Miles
I lived in these houses a long time, Miles.

75
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,280
我知道该怎么走
I think I can remember how to get there.

76
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,850
我还在你住这30年前就住过呢
Well, I lived in these houses 30 years before you did--

77
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,940
按现在的时间算  就是上周
Otherwise known as last week.

78
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,640
可我完全不知道我们在哪
And I have no idea where the hell we are.

79
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,650
那你跟着我是好事
Guess it's a good thing you're following me.

80
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,950
你能告诉我
You mind if I ask

81
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,810
你有多少炸药吗  Ben
How much explosive you have access to, Ben?

82
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,120
多到能炸毁飞机十次
More than enough to destroy the plane ten times over

83
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,010
让那个怪物没法离岛
And keep it from ever leaving this island.

84
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,990
这么久了  你确定炸药还在吗
Been a long time. You sure it's still there?

85
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,680
那可是C4炸药  Richard  我藏的时候很谨慎
It's c-4, Richard. I put some thought into hiding it.

86
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,200
我猜猜  藏在饼干罐里吗
Let me guess--cookie jar.

87
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,980
别傻了
Don't be ridiculous.

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,390
藏在我书架后的密室里
It's in my secret room behind the bookcase.

89
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,120
怎么了
What's wrong?

90
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,420
就是  我在死人周围会有感应
It's just, I, you know, I get wonky around dead stuff.

91
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,230
你有事情想说吗  Miles
Do you have something you wanna share with us, Miles?

92
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,600
我不确定
I-I don't think--

93
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,060
-是什么  -是Alex
- What is it?  - It's Alex.

94
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,630
你女儿
It's your daughter.

95
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,180
你走后  我葬了她
After you left, I buried her.

96
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,760
谢谢你  Richard
Thank you, Richard.

97
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,680
那是什么  密室吗
What's that? A secreter room?

98
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,100
这是别人告诉我能召唤怪物的地方
It's where I was told I could summon the monster.

99
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,960
后来我才知道是怪物在召唤我
That's before I realized that it was the one summoning me.

100
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,670
Richard  你出的主意
Okay. Richard, it's your idea.

101
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,500
你说我们是炸烂飞机  还是完全摧毁
Are we looking to cripple the plane or blow it to hell?

102
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,370
完全摧毁
Blow it to hell.

103
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,390
那就全部都拿上吧
Then we'd better take it all.

104
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,900
不许动
Don't move!

105
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,110
把手举起来
Show me your hands.

106
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,100
冷静  我绝无恶意
Calm down. It's--it's okay.

107
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,410
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

108
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,880
她是我的人
She's with me.

109
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,920
你好  Benjamin
Hello, Benjamin.

110
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,200
我能进来吗
May I come in?

111
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,960
你来这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

112
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,470
把枪放下  Benjamin
Put the gun down, Benjamin.

113
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,440
去码头拿船上的仪器  然后把船弄沉
Go to the dock, take our equitment from the outrigger and then sink it.

114
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,340
-遵命  -她哪也不能去
- You got it.  - She's not going anywhere.

115
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
你要是不回答我  我发誓
If you don't answer me, I swear...

116
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,190
杀了我  你也没有生还的机会
You shoot me, and your last chance of survival will be gone.

117
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,900
去吧  他不会动手
Go. He won't do anything.

118
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,590
你们来这干嘛  Richard
What are you doing here, Richard?

119
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,530
我们来拿炸药
We're getting explosives

120
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,380
炸毁另一座岛上的飞机
To destroy the plane on the other island.

121
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,190
-为什么  -与你无关
- Why would you want to do that?  - None of your damned business.

122
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,850
我一上岛就在飞机上装了炸药
I've had that plane rigged with explosives since I got here.

123
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,380
Benjamin  我还是比你有先见之明
As usual, Benjamin, I'm three steps ahead of you.

124
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,470
你怎么回来的  Charles
How did you get back here, Charles?

125
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,100
Jacob让我来的
Jacob invited me.

126
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,090
撒谎  你根本没见过Jacob
That's a lie. You've never even seen Jacob.

127
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,100
我见过  他来找过我
I most certainly have. He visited me,

128
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,930
就在你们毁了我的货船不久
Not long after your people destroyed my freighter.

129
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,030
他说我的方法是错误的
He convinced me of the error of my ways

130
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,570
并告诉我如何才能
And told me everything I need to know

131
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,390
达到目的
For this exact purpose.

132
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,180
什么目的
What purpose?

133
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,170
Charles
Charles?

134
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,870
请说
Yes.

135
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,370
Locke过来了
It's Locke. He's coming.

136
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,220
-他看到你了吗  -应该没有
- Has he seen you?  - No, I don't think so.

137
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,220
我们的船还在码头  我没时间...
Our boat is still there. I didn't have time to--

138
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,440
快跑  尽快跑回来
Run. Get back here as fast as you can.

139
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,370
如果你们不想死  我们得躲起来
If you don't want to die, we need to hide.

140
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,140
可能会有点刺痛  Linus老师
This may sting a bit, mr. Linus.

141
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,490
应该是Linus博士
It's dr. Linus, actually.

142
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,030
我去帮你拿个冰袋
I'll go get you an ice pack.

143
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,080
Linus博士
Dr. Linus?

144
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,690
你没事吧
Are you all right? 

145
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,620
我听说停车场里出了点事
I heard there was a--an incident in the parking lot. 

146
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,990
是的  我和人打架了
Yes, I got into a fight.

147
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,820
打架  和谁
A fight? With who?

148
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,080
我看到了那个撞伤你的人  Locke先生
I saw the man that ran you down, Mr. Locke.

149
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,110
他回来了  我一接近他  他就
He was back. I approached him, and he just...

150
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,050
攻击了我
attacked me.

151
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,310
然后发生了非常非常离奇的事情
And then the strangest thing happened.

152
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,800
在他打我的时候
While he was beating me,

153
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,240
我感觉自己看到了什么
I think-- I think I saw something.

154
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,410
你干嘛
What are you doing?

155
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,210
我在报警
I'm calling the police.

156
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,440
也许你不该报警
You may not want to do that. 

157
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,070
为什么不报警
Well, why wouldn't I want to?

158
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,990
那个人告诉我说  他并不想伤害你
The man told me that he wasn't trying to hurt you.

159
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,820
他说他想让你放手
He told me that he was trying to get you to let go.

160
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,480
洛杉矶警察局
L.A.P.D.

161
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
不知为什么  我相信他的话
And for some reason, I believed him.

162
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,830
喂  洛杉矶警察局
Hello? L.A.P.D.

163
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,730
你明白他的意思吗  Locke先生
Do you have any idea what he was talking about, Mr. Locke?

164
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,700
对你而言是不是别有所指
Does that mean something to you?

165
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,890
喂  洛杉矶警察局
Hello? L.A.P.D.

166
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,670
打扰一下
Excuse me.

167
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,870
我想见一下警官
I'd like to see a detective, please.

168
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,190
怎么这身打扮  有人死了吗
What's with the getup? Somebody die?

169
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,540
我父亲博物馆的福利 
The benefit at my dad's museum?

170
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,910
我一整周都在和你说的音乐会
The concert I've been telling you about all week?

171
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,300
记起来了吗  
Ring a bell? 

172
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,740
我一直都记着呢
Yeah, it's all I've been thinking about.

173
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,430
如果你想去的话  还是可以跟我一起去的
You can still be my date if you want to.

174
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,500
那个恨透我的红发小妞会去吗
That red-headed chick that hates me gonna be there?

175
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,150
Charlotte  会啊
Charlotte. Yeah.

176
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,960
那算了
Yeah, pass.

177
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,790
Ford警官  这个人有事要跟你说
Detective Ford, this guy's got somethin' to tell ya.

178
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
是吗
Yeah?

179
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,470
几天前在华盛顿塔斯廷高中
There was a hit and run a few days ago

180
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,260
有一起撞人逃逸事件
at Washington Tustin high school.

181
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,620
今天早上
And then this morning

182
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,520
该校的一名教师
one of the teachers there was--

183
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,290
被同一犯罪嫌疑人打成了重伤
was beaten badly by the-- by the same suspect.

184
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,160
然后呢
Yeah? And?

185
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,050
我就是犯罪嫌疑人
I'm the suspect.

186
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,790
谢谢你省去了纳税人
Thanks for saving the taxpayers the trouble

187
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,040
为了缉捕你的钱
of hunting you down.

188
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,630
不客气
You're welcome.

189
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,550
下午好
Good afternoon.

190
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,300
今天过得好吗
And how are you doing today?

191
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,510
好极了
Terrific.

192
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,920
知道那口井的具体位置吗
Any idea exactly where this well is?

193
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,340
Sayid说就在我们的营地附近
Sayid said it was close to our camp.

194
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,750
还有差不多一小时
We're about an hour away.

195
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,820
如果Locke想置Desmond于死地
If Locke wanted Desmond dead, 

196
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,010
为什么不直接杀了他
why didn't he just kill him?

197
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,010
谁知道呢  也许这是他的原则吧
Who knows? Maybe it's one of his rules.

198
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,670
潜艇里的炸弹
The bomb on the sub.

199
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,160
你说过他不能杀我们
You said he couldn't kill us.

200
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,420
我之前一直都错了
I've been wrong before.

201
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,320
我害死了他们  对不对
I killed them, didn't I?

202
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,780
没有
No.

203
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,210
是他害死了他们
He killed them.

204
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,690
你没事吧
You all right?

205
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,680
嗯  我没事
Yeah. I'm fine.

206
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,780
好
Okay.

207
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,840
把骨灰给我
Give me the ashes.

208
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
什么  你是谁
What? Who are you?

209
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,110
Ilana死后你从她身上拿走的骨灰  把它还给我
Give me the ashes you took from Ilana's things after she died.

210
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,770
我知道就在你口袋里
I know they're in your pocket.

211
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,260
为什么  
Why? 

212
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,170
因为是我的
Because they're mine.

213
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,470
你要它干什么
What do you want 'em for?

214
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,820
你好  Hugo
Hello, Hugo.

215
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,750
老兄
Dude.

216
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,330
我一直在等你出现  你去哪儿了
I've been waiting for you to show up. Where you been?

217
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,440
无关紧要了  我现在不是在这嘛
Doesn't matter. I'm here now.

218
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,910
你看到一个孩子
Did you see a kid 

219
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,340
拿着你的骨灰经过这里吗
run by here with your ashes?

220
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,990
我的骨灰就在那堆火里
My ashes are right there in that fire.

221
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,210
当它烧尽时  你就再也见不到我了
When it burns out, you'll never see me again.

222
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,040
什么
Uh, what?

223
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,700
你该把你朋友叫来
You should get your friends.

224
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,520
我们快成功了  Hugo
We're very close to the end, Hugo.

225
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,280
Charles  我们走
Charles, let's go.

226
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,700
没时间了  Linus有一间密室  快来
There's no time. Linus has a hidden room. Come on.

227
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,860
你还在等什么
What are you waiting for? 

228
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,040
我不想躲起来
I'm not interested in hiding.

229
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,990
他迟早都会找到我的
He's gonna find me sooner or later anyway.

230
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,100
我宁愿和他来个了断
I'd rather have it over with.

231
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,800
两个计划都不错  但我还是保命要紧
These are both great plans, but I'm gonna go with surviving.

232
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,310
如果你想找我们  我们从林子那边走
If you need us, we'll be running through the jungle.

233
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,250
Miles  等等
Miles, wait.

234
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,240
把你的手提对讲机给我
Give me your walkie-talkies. 

235
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:01,630
干什么
Why?

236
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,800
因为我问你要
Because I asked.

237
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,470
谢谢  以防万一我需要你
Thank you. In case I need you.

238
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,910
他会杀了你的  你很清楚
He's gonna kill you. You know that.

239
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,950
那我想这就是永别了
Then I guess this is good-bye.

240
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,100
在我等待命定的劫数时  你愿意入伙吗 
Care to join me outside while I wait for the inevitable?

241
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,570
我去和他谈  我了解这个人
I-I'm gonna talk to him. I know this man.

242
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,430
他就是想要我和他一起
All he wants is for me to join him,

243
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,640
如果我能让他和我一起离开
and if I can get him to leave with me,

244
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,480
也许能给你们赢得一次机会
maybe that'll give the rest of you a chance. 

245
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,140
祝你好运
Good luck with that.

246
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,770
正是我要找的人
Just the man I was looking for.

247
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,770
嗯  你找到我了
Well, you found me.

248
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,800
来杯柠檬水吗
Can I get you a glass of lemonade?

249
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,130
我需要你
I need you...

250
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,570
帮我铲除一些人  Ben
to kill some people for me, Ben.

251
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,440
为什么我要这么做呢
And why would I do that?

252
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,070
因为一旦我离开了这座小岛
Because once I leave this island,

253
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,340
你便能将它据为己有
you can have it all to yourself.

254
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,610
好吧
All right.

255
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,880
很好
Good.

256
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,290
码头那边的船是谁的
Now...whose outrigger is that down at the dock?

257
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,690
我想是Charles Widmore的
I believe it's Charles Widmore's.

258
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
你知道在哪儿能找到他吗
And do you know where I might find him?

259
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,160
他就躲在我的壁橱里
He's hiding in my closet.

260
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,010
Linus博士
Oh, my god. Hey, Dr. Linus.

261
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,610
你好  Alex
Hello, Alex.

262
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,880
出什么事了
Oh, my god. What happened?

263
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,420
我和一个火气很大的人
I found myself confronting someone

264
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,900
发生了点冲突
that had a bit of a temper. 

265
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,520
什么
What?

266
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,520
怎么会有人要伤害你呢
Why would someone want to hurt you?

267
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,130
你就像是个超级大好人
You're, like, the--the nicest guy ever.

268
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,530
我想他们把我和另一个人混淆了
I guess they had me confused with somebody else.

269
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,230
你不该开车
Well, you shouldn't be driving.

270
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,280
我妈妈在那边等我呢
My mom's waiting for me over there.

271
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,250
让我们载你回家吧
Let us give you a ride home.

272
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,650
不了  我可不想麻烦你们
Oh, no, I'm not going to be any trouble to you.

273
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,990
Linus博士  求你了
Dr. Linus, please.

274
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,120
你只有一只手了  看起来就像拿破仑
You've got one hand. You look like Napoleon.

275
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,760
说得没错
Excellent point.

276
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,070
妈妈
Hey, mom!

277
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,810
可以把Linus博士送回家吗
Is it okay if we give Dr. Linus a ride home?

278
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,810
当然
Of course.

279
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,210
您为我女儿尽心尽力
After everything you have done for my daughter,

280
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,870
送您回家是理所应当的事情
a ride is the least we can do.

281
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,470
我是Danielle
I'm Danielle.

282
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,720
Benjamin Linus
Benjamin Linus.

283
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,620
妈妈  Linus博士能到我们家吃晚餐吗
Hey, mom, can Dr. Linus come over for dinner?

284
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,590
今晚吃酒闷仔鸡
It's coq au vin night.

285
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
真的不用了  
Oh, that's really not necessary-- 

286
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,890
不行  我们坚持
Oh, no, no, we insist,

287
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,430
即使我们得绑架你
even if we have to kidnap you.

288
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,700
这边  请
Here, please.

289
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,370
能拿一下那个盘子吗
Do you mind getting that plate?

290
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,760
Linus博士
Dr. Linus...

291
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,710
谢谢你
Thank you.

292
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,110
能为除了Alex以外的某个人做饭
It's so nice to be able to cook for someone

293
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,780
真是太开心了
Other than Alex.

294
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,850
请您别介意  请问他父亲在哪
If you don't mind my asking, where is her father?

295
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,920
Alex两岁时他就去世了
He died when Alex was 2.

296
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,620
这也许就是她如此依恋您的原因
That's probably why she's so attached to you.

297
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,320
您说什么
Excuse me?

298
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,030
您对她的种种关心
All the interest you've taken in her,

299
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,930
您对她的一切帮助
All the help you've given...

300
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,770
您是一直以来最接近她父亲的人
You're the closest thing to a father she's ever had.

301
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,960
您
Are you...

302
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,310
您还好吧
Are you all right?

303
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,520
我很好  肯定是洋葱闹的
I'm fine. I'm sure it's the onions.

304
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,420
我下次会少放点
Oh. I'll put in less next time.

305
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,970
你先请
After you.

306
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,270
Charles和他的一个女助手在这
Charles and his lady friend are in here.

307
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,040
她有枪
She's armed,

308
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,450
但我想这对你不构成威胁
but I'm guessing that's not a problem for you.

309
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,580
在这等着
Wait out here.

310
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,660
你不必目睹这些
You don't need to see this.

311
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,720
我想目睹一下
I want to see this.

312
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,980
抱歉  Charles
Sorry, Charles.

313
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,910
真是惊喜呀
What a pleasant surprise.

314
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,820
能不隔着围栏面对面交流真好呀
How nice to be able to talk without those fences between us.

315
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,020
你是哪位
And who might you be?

316
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,120
Zoe  我叫Zoe  我
Zoe. My name is Zoe. I--

317
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,160
别跟他说话  什么也别说
Don't talk to him. Don't say anything.

318
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,800
你为什么杀她
Why would you do that?

319
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,570
你让她别跟我说话  她必定是无名小卒
You told her not to talk to me. That made her pointless.

320
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,470
现在  Charles  很显然你不怕死
Now, Charles, it's clear you're not afraid to die.

321
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,910
那只有一个办法让你
So there's only one way to motivate you

322
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,050
告诉我我想知道的事情了
To tell me what I want to know.

323
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,750
很快一切都将结束  我将得到我想要的
Soon, this will all be over. I'll get what I want.

324
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,690
我也终将离岛
And I'll finally leave this island.

325
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,420
一旦我出岛了  我要做的第一件事
And when I do, the first thing I'm going to do

326
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,920
就是杀掉你女儿
is kill your daughter.

327
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,500
Penny
Penny.

328
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,430
不管我说不说你都会杀了她
You'll kill her whether I talk to you or not.

329
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,930
不  不会的  我向你保证
No, I won't. I give you my word.

330
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,720
那我就该相信你了吗
And I'm supposed to take your word?

331
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,120
告诉我你为什么回来
You tell me why I came back here,

332
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,060
我就不会伤害你女儿了
And I won't hurt your daughter.

333
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,760
我把Desmond Hume带回到这里
I brought Desmond Hume back here

334
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,030
因为他对电磁有很独特的阻抗能力
because of his unique resistance to electromagnetism.

335
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,340
他是最后的手段
He was a measure of last resort.

336
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,540
什么叫"最后的手段"
What do you mean, "Last resort"?

337
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,010
我不会当着他的面再说别的了
I'm not saying any more in front of him.

338
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,190
那小声告诉我
Well, then whisper to me.

339
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,050
他救不了自己的女儿
He doesn't get to save his daughter.

340
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,220
Ben  你总是给我惊喜
Ben... you never cease to amaze me.

341
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,850
好在我已经知道了我想要的
Fortunately, he had already told me what I needed to know,

342
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,980
所以  没啥损失
So... no harm done.

343
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,580
很好
Good.

344
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,690
你是说了还要杀其他人吧
Did you say there were some other people to kill?

345
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,180
你好  Kate  James
Hello, Kate, James.

346
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,910
Jack
Jack.

347
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,350
-他就站在火堆旁向你们问好  -我听见了
- He's right there by the fire. He says hello--  - I heard him.

348
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,690
什么  你能看见他吗
What, you can see him?

349
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,160
是的  我能看见他
Yeah, I can see him.

350
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,000
Kate  Sawyer  你俩呢
Kate? Sawyer? You, too?

351
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,730
你就是把我们的名字写到墙上那人吗
So you're the one who wrote our names on the wall.

352
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,800
是我
I am.

353
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,810
Sun和Jin Kwon  还有Sayid Jarrah
Sun and Jin Kwon and Sayid Jarrah--

354
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,040
-他们的名字也在墙上吗  -是的
- You wrote their names on the wall?  - Yes.

355
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,400
因为这个他们就得死吗
Is that why they're dead?

356
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,300
我非常抱歉
I'm very sorry.

357
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,590
-你非常抱歉  -Kate
- You're sorry?  - Kate.

358
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,540
我想知道原因
No, I wanna know why.

359
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,310
我想知道Sun和Jin还有Sayid没有白白送命
I wanna know that sun and jin and sayid didn't die for nothing.

360
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,990
过来坐下
Come and sit down.

361
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,460
我来告诉你们他们为何而死
And I'll tell you what they died for.

362
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,800
我会告诉你们我为什么选了他们
I'll tell you why I chose them...

363
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,870
为什么选了你们
And why I chose you.

364
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,490
我会告诉你们  关于保护这个岛
And then I'll tell you everything you need to know

365
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,770
你们需要知道的一切
about protecting this island,

366
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,530
因为等这堆火燃尽的时候
because by the time that fire burns out,

367
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,810
你们之中的一人就得开始这样做了
One of you is gonna have to start doing it.

368
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,680
您有空吗
You got a minute?

369
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,280
Locke先生  当然
Mr. Locke. Yes.

370
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,420
快请进
Yes, come on in.

371
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,310
那是你儿子吗
Is that your son?

372
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,930
是的  那是去年感恩节拍的
Yes. That's, uh, last Thanksgiving.

373
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,730
他长得很像你
He looks just like you.

374
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,900
可别告诉他
Don't tell him that.

375
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,580
请问我能为您做点什么吗  Locke先生
So what can I do for you, mr. Locke?

376
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,520
Shepherd医生  您和我搭乘了悉尼来的同一航班
Dr. Shephard, you and I were on the same plane from Sydney.

377
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,120
您给了我名片
You gave me your card, and...

378
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,590
第二天我就扔了  请别介意
Next day, I threw it away. No offense.

379
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,330
没关系
None taken.

380
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,960
不说这个了
Anyway...

381
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,700
几天之后我被车撞了
Then a few days later, I get hit by a car.

382
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,050
洛杉矶这么多医生
And of all the doctors in Los Angeles,

383
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,740
偏偏我又遇上您
I ended up with you.

384
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:43,600
您救了我之后  仍想治好我的瘫痪
Then a--after you saved my life, you still wanna fix me,

385
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,110
而我仍然  不希望被治好
and I still... don't wanna be fixed.

386
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,850
就这样
Okay.

387
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,120
但之后
Then...

388
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:57,360
那个撞倒我的人今天再次来到我学校
The man who ran me down shows up at my school today again.

389
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,890
在停车场把一个老师狠狠打了一顿
He beat up a teacher in the parking lot.

390
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,330
但你知道他对他说了什么吗
But do you know what he said to him?

391
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,800
他说他并不是想伤害我
He said that he wasn't there to hurt me.

392
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,730
他只是想帮我"放手"
He was there to help me "let go",

393
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,280
跟上次咱们见面时
Which is exactly the same thing that you said to me

394
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,040
您对我说的一模一样
the last time you and I saw each other.

395
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,100
不好意思  你的意思是
I'm sorry. Are--are you saying

396
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,140
我派了这个人去撞你
that I sent this man to run you down?

397
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,410
不不不
No. No, no. No, no, no.

398
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,510
但如果这一切
But--but what if all this...

399
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,120
也许是事出有因呢
maybe this is happening for a reason.

400
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,080
也许你本该治好我呢
Maybe you're supposed to fix me.

401
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,620
Locke先生  我是想治好你
Mr. Locke, I want to fix you,

402
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,190
但我想您把巧合误解为命运了
but I think you're mistaking coincidence for fate.

403
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,430
随您怎么说  但现在我来了
You can call it whatever you want, but here I am,

404
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,930
而且我
And I...

405
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,650
我想我已准备好摆脱这个轮椅了
I think I'm ready to get out of this chair.

406
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,200
我不知道该从何说起
I don't really know where to start.

407
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,730
那就说说你为什么带我们来这个岛吧
How about with why you brought us to the island?

408
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,800
我把你们所有人带来是因为我犯了个错误
I brought all of you here because I made a mistake.

409
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,920
很久很久以前犯下的错误
A mistake I made a very long time ago,

410
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,890
而现在就因为它
And now because of that,

411
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,430
很可能你们每个人
there's a very good chance that every single one of you

412
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,830
以及你们在乎的每个人都会因此而死
and every you've ever cared about is going to die.

413
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,620
什么错误
What mistake?

414
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,560
你们所说的"黑烟"
You call him "the monster".

415
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,160
对于他的行为我负有责任
But I'm responsible for what happened to him.

416
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,630
是我害他变成那样
I made him that way.

417
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,120
从那以后
And ever since then,

418
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,420
他一直都在试图杀了我
He's been trying to kill me.

419
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,320
他搞清如何下手只是时间问题
It was only a matter of time before he figured out how,

420
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,690
当他成功了  得有人来接替我
And when he did, someone would have to replace me.

421
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,230
所以我把你们都带来这了
And that's why I brought you all here.

422
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,870
跟我说说  Jacob
Tell me something, Jacob.

423
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,940
为什么我要因为你的错误而受惩罚
Why do I gotta be punished for your mistake?

424
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,870
你凭什么觉得你能插手我的生活
What made you think you can mess with my life?

425
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,470
我活得好好的  你却非把我拉来这破地
I was doin' just fine till you dragged my ass to this damn rock.

426
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,810
不  你活得不好
No, you weren't.

427
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,940
你们谁都活的不好
None of you were.

428
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,610
我并没破坏你们的幸福生活
I didn't pluck any of you out of a happy existence.

429
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,620
你们都不完美
You were all flawed.

430
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,890
选你们是因为你们像我
I chose you because you were like me.

431
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,830
你们都是独一无二的
You were all alone.

432
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,930
你们都在寻觅着什么
You were all looking for something

433
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,370
在那个世界却无法找到
that you couldn't find out there.

434
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,660
我选择你们是因为你们需要这个岛
I chose you because you needed this place

435
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,870
正如我需要你们一样
as much as it needed you.

436
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,600
那为什么从墙上划掉了我的名字
Why did you cross my name off of your wall?

437
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,440
因为你做了母亲
Because you became a mother.

438
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,570
那只是洞里画的一条粉笔道
It's just a line of chalk in a cave.

439
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,910
Kate  如果愿意你也有份儿
The job is yours if you want it, Kate.

440
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,180
要我们做什么
What is the job?

441
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,190
岛中心有处光
There's a light at the center of the island.

442
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,100
你们得确保那光永不熄灭
You have to make sure it never goes out.

443
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,350
你们得守护它
That's how you protect it.

444
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,290
你那"黑烟"朋友说那没什么可保护的
Your monster friend said there was nothing to protect it from.

445
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,660
你们就是要保证别让他靠近
You have to protect it from him.

446
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,200
你们要做到我无法做到
You must do what I couldn't...

447
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,100
-无能为力的  -要我们杀了他
- What I wasn't able to do. - You want us to kill him.

448
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,530
-那可能吗  -但愿吧
- Is that even possible? - I hope so,

449
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,000
因为他肯定会设法杀掉你们
Because he is certainly going to try to kill you.

450
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,140
那么...
So...

451
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,340
你打算怎么选
How you gonna pick?

452
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,110
Hugo  不是我要选
I'm not going to pick, Hugo.

453
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,250
我要让你们拥有我一直都没有的...
I want you to have the one thing that I was never given--

454
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,150
选择
A choice.

455
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,430
要是我们都不选呢
And if none of us chooses it?

456
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,600
那结局会非常凄惨
Then this ends very badly.

457
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,950
我来吧
I'll do it.

458
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,930
这也是我来岛的原因
This is why I'm here.

459
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,360
这是...
This is...

460
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,830
这是我注定要做的
This is what I'm supposed to do.

461
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,070
你确定吗  Jack
Is that a question, Jack?

462
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,240
确定
No.

463
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,410
很好
Good.

464
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,450
那就开始吧
Then it's time.

465
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,030
过去我觉得那家伙有点救世主情结
And I thought that guy had a god complex before.

466
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,240
James  别说了
James.

467
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,940
我知道
Yeah, I know.

468
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,040
很庆幸不是我
I'm just glad it's not me.

469
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,980
还记着你刚到岛上
Do you remember that bamboo field you woke up in

470
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,980
在一片竹林上醒来吗
When you first got here?

471
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,320
记着
Yeah.

472
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,700
穿过竹林再越过山脊
Beyond that field, across a ridge,

473
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,100
就到岛的心脏了
Is the heart of the island.

474
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,560
亮光就在那儿
That's where the light is.

475
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,190
也就是他想办法要去的地方
That's where he's trying to go.

476
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,600
你就是要守护那里
And that's what you have to protect.

477
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,370
穿过竹林吗
Past the bamboo?

478
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,330
可那儿什么也没有
There's nothing out there.

479
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,140
有的  Jack
Yes, there is, Jack.

480
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,570
现在你能找到那儿了
And now you'll be able to get there.

481
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,150
有杯子吗
Do you have a cup?

482
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,380
我真还带着
Yeah. Yeah, actually, I do.

483
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,480
把这喝了
Drink this.

484
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,990
我得保护那里多久
How long am I gonna have to do this job?

485
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,160
尽可能的久
As long as you can.

486
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,960
现在你和我一样了
Now you're like me.

487
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,330
看好了  这就是Jarrah和Hume
All righty. Here's Jarrah and Hume.

488
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,330
隔壁的小丫头是Austen
This little lady next door is Austen.

489
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,300
很高兴把你们都逮住
It's been real nice having y'all...

490
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,230
不过得把你们遣送县监狱
But you're shipping off to county,

491
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,270
好好上路吧
So best of luck and vaya con dios.

492
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,970
你还是能放了我的
You could still let me go.

493
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,010
我干嘛要这么做
Why the hell would I do that?

494
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,610
因为我跟你说过我没罪
Because I told you I was innocent,

495
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,970
你也信了
And you believed me.

496
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,280
没用的
Doesn't matter.

497
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,410
还是没法放你  我是警察
Still can't let you go. I'm a cop.

498
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,220
在我看你可不像个警察
You don't seem like a cop to me.

499
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,190
很高兴认识你
Nice knowing ya.

500
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,700
1-F-21回答
1-F-21 responding.

501
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,070
我觉得是时候跑了
I think it's time to leave.

502
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,970
-什么  -我说咱们现在该跑了
-What? -I said, I think it's time to leave.

503
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,340
准备好逃出去了吗
Are you ready to get out of here?

504
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,610
不好意思你是...
I'm sorry. Who are you?

505
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,850
一个非要自己进来的疯子
He's a crazy person who turned himself in.

506
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,750
你为什么事儿自首的
What'd you turn yourself in for?

507
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,680
我开车撞了个坐轮椅的
I ran over a guy in a wheelchair.

508
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,250
我说对了吧
You see what I mean?

509
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,220
行  就算我是疯子
All right. I'm crazy.

510
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,690
但你们到底要不要跑
But do you want to get out of here or not?

511
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,630
怎么跑  让司机师傅停车吗
So, what, are you just gonna tell the driver to stop?

512
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,230
司机知道在哪儿停  不过等车停了
The driver already knows where to stop. But when that happens,

513
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,200
你们得相信我
you're gonna have to give me your trust.

514
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,440
-信你  -没错儿
- Our trust? - That's right.

515
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,400
因为等我帮你逃走后
Because after I set you free,

516
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,840
我要让你们每人做件事
I'm gonna ask each of you to do something,

517
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,660
你们必须向我保证会去做
And you're gonna have to promise me that you'll do it.

518
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,600
-你怎么说  -没问题  我保证
- So what do you say? - Oh, absolutely, I promise.

519
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,540
你呢
How about you?

520
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,130
一言为定
Okay. Sure.

521
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:00,860
那好吧
All right, then.

522
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,220
Hume是哪位
Who's Hume?

523
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,980
-是我  -你那拿着要给我的钱的朋友呢
- That's me. - Where's your friend with my money?

524
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,160
不然恐怕我就要
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to say

525
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,830
-把你们几个越狱犯都崩了  -别急  他就来
- I shot all of you trying to escape. - Don't worry. He'll be here.

526
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,260
他来了
Oh, here he comes.

527
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,770
-抱歉我来晚了  哥们儿  -没事
- Sorry I'm late, Dude. - Don't worry about it.

528
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,170
你没告诉我
Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Ana

529
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,210
-Ana Lucia也来啊  -我认识你吗 死胖子
- lucia was gonna be here. - Do I know you, tubby?

530
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,480
不认识  我们没见过
Oh. No. We never met.

531
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,950
这是你的钱
Anyways, here's your money.

532
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,210
十二万五对吧
125 grand, right?

533
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,200
没错
Yeah, that's right.

534
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,790
很高兴不认识你
Nice not knowing you.

535
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,930
-她不和我们走吗  -不  她还没准备好
- She's not coming with us? - No, she's not ready yet.

536
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,570
我把大黄蜂给你开来了
I brought you my camaro.

537
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,560
车钥匙在门毡下面
The keys are under the floor mat.

538
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,680
你要的都在后备箱里  -太好了
- Everything you need's is in the trunk. - All right, good.

539
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,100
知道把他们带到哪儿吧
Um, you know where you're taking 'em, yeah?

540
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,910
-当然  -那好咱走
- Absolutely. - All right, well, we should get going.

541
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,570
好  你跟着他  你跟我走
Okay, you're with him, and you're with me.

542
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,800
我跟你走什么意思
What do you mean, I'm with you?

543
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,000
我们...
We...

544
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,970
我们去听音乐会
Are going to a concert.

545
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,380
走吧
Let's go.

546
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,040
能问你点事吗
Hey, can I ask you something?

547
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,410
说
Shoot.

548
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,000
要是你随时都能变成黑烟
If you can turn yourself into smoke whenever you want,

549
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,300
那干嘛还费劲走路
Why do you bother walking?

550
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,370
我喜欢脚走在地面上那种感觉
I like the feel of my feet on the ground.

551
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,940
这样我觉着自己还是人类
Reminds me that I was human.

552
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,360
咱到了
We're here.

553
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,770
口渴了吗
Are you thirsty?

554
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,010
这就是我把Desmond Hume推下去的那口井
This is the well I threw Desmond Hume into.

555
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,930
怎么回事
What's the matter?

556
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,750
我派Sayid去干掉Desmond
I sent Sayid to kill Desmond.

557
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,690
显然他没杀
Obviously, he didn't.

558
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,730
看来有人帮他逃出去了
Looks like someone helped him out.

559
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,330
不  Ben  是有人帮了我一把
No, Ben. Someone helped me out.

560
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,170
Widmore和你说什么了
What did Widmore say to you?

561
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,280
他说有Desmond就万无一失了
He said Desmond was a fail-safe.

562
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,800
就像Jacob手上一个杀手锏  
Jacob's last resort in case, god forbid,

563
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,470
我曾想方设法把他那些候选人都杀了
I managed to kill all of his beloved candidates--

564
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:05,940
他阻止我离开的最后办法
One final way to make sure that I never leave this place.

565
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,740
那他活着你怎么还高兴呢
Then... why are you happy that he's still alive?

566
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,350
因为我要找到Desmond
Because I'm gonna find Desmond.

567
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,850
一旦找到了他  他就会帮我
And when I do, he's gonna help me

568
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,890
做那件我永远无法做到的事
do the one thing that I could never do myself.

569
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,810
我要毁掉这个岛
I'm gonna destroy the island.
