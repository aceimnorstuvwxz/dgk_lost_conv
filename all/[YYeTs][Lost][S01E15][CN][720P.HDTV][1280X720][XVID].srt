恩  恩  他去海滩了

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,030
看起来这里发生过一场争斗
Looks like there might have been a struggle

7

我想他们是被带走了

如果你再跟着我

20
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:16,094
你在哪找到她的?
Where'd you find her?

21
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:18,052
往北一英里 当时我们正在找狗

-Did she say anything?  -Holy man! Is she injured?

24
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,078
她没事吧?
Is she all right?

25
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,074
大家退后一点 好吗?
Everybody needs to back off, okay?

26
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:32,005
让她呼吸点新鲜空气
Just give her some air.

27
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:43,042
Claire 能听到我说话吗?

00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:59,010

你是谁?
Who are you?

39
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:20,048
你们是谁?!
Who are you?!

40
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:23,057
你们这些人是谁?!
Who are you people?

41
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,063
我不明白
I don't understand.

42
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:31,081
我不认识什么Ethan
I don't know any Ethan.

43
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:35,097
我不...我不记得了
I... I don't remember.

44
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,062
我不记得你们中的任何一个
I don't remember any of you.

45
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:44,052
我也不记得这一切
I don't remember any of this.

46
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,062
那你记得什么?
What do you remember?

47
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:54,020
我..我在一架飞机上
Um...I was on a plane...

48
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:58,020
从悉尼飞往洛杉矶
...um, flying to LA from Sydney.

49
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:04,026
Claire...

50
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:07,010
大家都在那架飞机上
We were all on that plane.

51
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:11,028
然后坠机了 掉在这个岛上
It crashed here, on this island.

52
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:16,060
这差不多是一个月前的事了
That was almost a month ago.

53
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:20,047
-不 我就要...  -你孩子没事儿
-No! I'm due...  -Your baby's fine.

54
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:23,019
他还会踢 一切都很正常
He's kicking. Everything's normal.

55
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,031
好吗?
Okay?

56
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:32,045
如果已经有一个月了 那为什么还没人来救我们?
Well, if it's been a month, then why hasn't somebody come to get us?

57
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:42,089
你知道发生什么事了?

58
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,038
我不知道

59
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,028
她还好吧

60
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:49,020
那女孩?

61
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,090
是的 我想应该没事

62
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:56,005
孩子呢?

63
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:01,080
我相信孩子也没事儿

64
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,070
你认为她是逃出来的吗?
You think she escaped?

65
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:18,086
你一直在我旁边 Boone你知道多少 我也就知道多少
You were right beside me, Boone. You know as much as I do.

66
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:20,095
她从哪儿来的?
But where'd she come from?

67
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,087
我意思是 我们都已经去过丛林深处了
I mean, we were out pretty deep.

68
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:25,041
那边根本没东西
Nothing's out there.

69
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:27,086
她没提到Ethan?
She didn't say anything about Ethan?

70
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:29,096
很明显 她根本不记得Ethan了
She doesn't even remember Ethan.

71
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:31,042
那家伙假装是我们中的一员
The guy pretends to be one of us

72
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:33,038
他把她拖进丛林里面差不多两个星期了
he drags her into the jungle for almost two weeks.

73
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,079
她会不记得他?
She doesn't remember him?

74
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:38,099
显然不记得
Apparently.

75
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,048
你觉得他在周围?
You think he's around?

76
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,016
我当然希望不了
I sure hope not.

77
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,044
Claire

78
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,055
这是你的日记
Here's your journal.

79
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:57,070
或许会有些帮助
It might help.

80
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,083
还有这是你睡觉的地方
And this is where you sleep.

81
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,064
很舒适 是吧?
It's quite cozy, isn't it?

82
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,066
当他..Ethan..
When he, Ethan...

83
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:17,028
当他把你带走的时候...
...when he took you away

84
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,084
也把我带走了
he took me too.

85
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:22,051
大伙都来追我们
The others came after us.

86
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:25,058
他们把我救回来了 但你...
They got me back. But you...

87
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:28,027
你却不见了
You were gone.

88
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:33,012
他..Ethan..是谁?
Who is he? Ethan?

89
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:37,035
Ethan...

90
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,008
Ethan是个坏人
Ethan's the bad guy.

91
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:46,054
所以那时.... 我们是在一起的
So we were together when...

92
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,061
是的
Yeah.

93
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:52,085
他为什么要放了你?
Well, why did he leave you?

94
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:58,025
这事我们明天早上再谈吧?!
Why don't we leave that lovely story for the morning?

95
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:00,018
你今天经历了够多了
You've had enough for one day.

96
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,077
-我睡不着  -哦
-I won't be sleeping.  -Oh...

97
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:05,048
我真是幸运
lucky for me.

98
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:08,031
我也不是个爱睡觉的家伙
Not much of a sleeper myself.

99
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:11,076
终于有个人陪我过夜了
Finally, I'll have someone to stay up with.

100
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:17,022
我们是朋友?

感觉怎么样 老兄?
How's that feel, mate?

104
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,007
感觉他妈的秒极了
Sodding fantastic.

105
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:40,069
很好 因为 呃 我们快吸完了
Good, 'cause,uh,we're almost out.

106
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,044
但是我们还没吸完
But we're not out yet.

107
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,085
该享受的时候就享受 我的朋友
Carpe diem, my friend.

108
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,055
听着 把你的法语留给 那些懂得欣赏的人听吧
Look, save your French for someone who appreciates it.

111
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,087
那么 这句是拉丁文吗..
Well, is it Latin for...

不
No

114
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,079
如果你还不想戒毒的话
 I suppose you ought to clean up then.

115
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,000
那么是时候该让你工作了

How you amass this information never ceases to amaze me. Tommy

你那招勾引我回家的方法不管用的
Your obvious plan to take me home and ravish me will not work.

128

Saucy sirens.

我信奉一夫一妻制

那女孩怀孕了...就快生了
The girl is pregnant.Very pregnant.

134

That's a stretch, Sayid.

你倒是告诉我 医生 你以前诊断的有几个是真正的失忆症
Tell me, doctor, how many times have you diagnosed actual amnesia?

142
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,001
有几个是这种选择性失忆?!
And such a selective brand of it?

143
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:46,079
是 是很少 但她经历过严重的创伤
Okay. It's rare. But she's been through a major trauma.

144
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,008
记忆回到坠机前是有可能的
It is possible that her memory reset to the crash.

145
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,021
恢复记忆的机会有多少?
And the chances of that memory returning?

146
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:57,025
我不知道
I don't know.

147
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:59,082
知道吗? 随你们怎么谈论Claire吧
You know what? You boys talk about Claire all you want.

148
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,055
我要过去陪陪她
I'm actually gonna spend time with her.

149
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:05,013
我感觉她还有些烦躁
I get the impression she might still be a tad upset.

150
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,015
Jin!

151
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,049
你回山洞去?
You heading back to the caves?

152
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,033
你好

153
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,051
你好

154
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:20,062
一块儿走更安全 对吧?
Safety in numbers, right?

155
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:22,006
当然...
Of course...

156
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:24,099
你根本不知道我在说什么
you have no idea what I'm talking about.

157
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,014
没有被卷入周围
How nice it must be to not be involved

158
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:31,001
一轮一轮的疯狂事多么好啊
in the bloody insanity that surrounds us at every turn.

159
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,079
这样真得很棒
It's quite beautiful really.

160
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,062
你只要照顾你的妻子
You take care of your wife.

161
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:37,042
其他的都是别人的事了
Everything else is someone else's problem.

162
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,082
不必参与任何决策
No need to be involved in the decision-making process.

163
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,046
不必对付能捍动大树的巨兽
No tree-shaking behemoths

164
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:44,084
不必研究法国人的求救信号
French transmissions

165
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,028
无知即是快乐
Just sweet bloody ignorance.

166
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,010
你知不知道你有多么的幸运?
You don't know how lucky you are,you know?

167
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:52,023
感觉一定很好 早上醒来 然后...
Must be nice. You wake up and...

168
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,059
怎么了?
What?

169
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,084
Charlie 我要她回来
Charlie, I want her back.

170
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,061
什么?我...
What? I...

171
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:23,014
我要你把她带回来
I want you to bring her back.

172
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,050
你对她做了什么?
What did you do to her?

173
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:30,050
你做过什么?!
What did you do?

174
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,064
你把她带到这儿
You bring her here.

175
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,016
如果你不乖乖照办的话
If you don't

176
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,063
我就杀了他们中的一个
I'm going to kill one of them.

177
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:46,068
明天日落前你还没把她带来的话
and then if you don't bring her back before sundown tomorrow

178
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,055
我就再杀一个...
I'll kill another...

179
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:51,004
再一个...
And another.

180
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,034
再一个
And another.

181
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,060
一天一个
One every day.

182
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:59,007
然后, Charlie...
And, Charlie...

183
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:02,059
我会最后一个杀你
I'll kill you last.

184
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,049
我们该怎么办?
What do we do?

185
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,094
我们去把他宰了
We go out and we bloody kill him.

186
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:24,000
冷静 Charlie 我们不想让其它人感到不安
Calm down. Charlie. We don't want the others to get upset.

187
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,085
管他们的 他现在就在那儿 Locke
Forget them. He's out there right now. Locke

188
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,097
我觉得他说的没错
I think he's right.

189
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:31,054
那家伙威胁要杀掉我们中的一个 除非我们把Claire带过去
The man threatens to kill one of us unless we bring him Claire.

190
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:34,019
那怎么办 难道我们就等着那一刻的到来吗?
and what? We just wait for that to happen?

191
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,058
我们以前跟踪过他 就一定能再跟踪一次
We tracked him once before. We can track him again.

192
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,090
你俩好像都忘了上次跟踪他的下场了吧
You both seem to have forgotten how that turned out.

193
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:40,030
他把你揍得半死
He bested you. Physically.

194
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,040
还把你吊在树上
He hung you from a tree.

195
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,000
徒手冲进丛林是搞不定他的
Running into the jungle unarmed is not gonna get the job done.

196
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,021
那怎么才能搞定他?
So, what does get it done?

197
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:49,020
我们封锁营地 把这件事有选择性的告诉小部分人
We circle the wagons, tell a select few about the threat

198
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:51,027
让他们分别在这儿和山洞那边放哨
we post them as sentries here and at the caves.

199
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,025
有选择性的告诉小部分人?
"Tell a select few"?

200
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:58,016
他说得出做得到 如果出了事 责任完全在我们
He does what he says he's gonna do, and that blood's on our hands.

201
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:03,023
好 Jack 那就告诉每个人
Okay, Jack, we tell everyone.

202
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:06,042
但你要是想保护他们  你就得考虑如何加强防御
But you wanna protect them, you need to start thinking defense.

203
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:09,041
大伙都撤离海滩 搬到山洞去
We move everybody off the beach back up into the caves.

204
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:12,048
要是Ethan不只一个人怎么办?
What if Ethan isn't alone?

205
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:13,096
也许他故意这样威胁我们...
What if he delivered his threat so that

206
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,016
让大家成为入瓮之鳖
we would gather like sheep to the slaughter

207
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:21,052
乖乖地聚在一起, 他们就能把我们一网打尽?
in a confined space where they could roll in and take us all in one fell swoop?

208
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:24,061
那好 John
Okay, John.

209
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:27,001
这么说来 你一定有好主意了 那么...
I mean, obviously you have a plan, so...

210
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:29,028
说来听听
let's hear it.

211
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,088
你知道发生什么事了吗?

212
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,003
发生什么事?

213
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:41,045
我怎么会知道?

214
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:42,088
或许其它人知道

215
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,040
其它人?

216
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:48,021
我被袭击都是因为他们干的好事

217
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:56,045
大伙都在避着我
The others are avoiding me.

218
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:59,055
-什么?  -没人愿意和我说话
-Sorry?  -No one will talk to me.

219
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:04,073
你知道 感觉就像发生了什么事
You know, it just feels like something's going on.

220
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,068
记起什么事了吗?
Anything coming back?

221
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:11,001
坠机后的事 都记不得了
After the crash, no.

222
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:14,041
反正这些事还是忘掉的好
Some of this stuff is probably better forgotten anyway

223
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,015
恩 我不知道你怎样
I don't know about you

224
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:19,056
但我们其他人都过得很开心
but the rest of us been having a wonderful time.

225
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:22,083
我们甚至建了个高尔夫球场
We even built a golf course.

226
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:29,095
你..你确定没发生什么事
You sure there's nothing going on?

227
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,078
当然
Absolutely.

228
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:39,037
好的
Okay.

229
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:46,081
你很自恋 是不是?
You're quite enamored of yourself,aren't you?

230
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:50,035
听着 Lucy 我知道这是我们的第一次约会 你应该表现得淑女一些
Now, Lucy, I know it's our first date, and you need to appear demure

231
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:54,046
但你知道 要是你想邀我和你上床 不必说"喝茶"
but if you want to invite me for sex,don't say "tea,"

232
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,003
说"做爱"
say "sex."

233
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:57,032
你到底喝不喝茶?
Do you want tea or not?

234
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,084
-来一杯  -很好
-I'd love some.  -Brilliant.

235
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,028
你老爸在哪儿?
So where is the old man?

236
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,083
我不知道
I don't know.

237
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:07,098
我想他是去斯劳镇收购某家造纸厂去了
I think he's buying some paper company up in Slough.

238
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:12,003
是这样 你俩相处的还算融洽吧?
Oh, yeah? You two get on?

239
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,085
事实上 我爸是个很酷的人
Dad's quite cool, actually.

240
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,007
当我告诉他我在和一个如假包换的摇滚明星约会时
He was rather proud when...

241
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:20,012
他还觉得很自豪
I told him I was going on a date with a bona fide rock star.

242
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:27,030
那是温斯顿 邱吉尔的东西
It was Winston Churchill's.

243
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:32,046
爸爸老收集大英帝国将领的各种垃圾东西
Dad collects all sorts of rubbish from the great leaders of the empire.

244
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:33,083
你应该见见他了
Hey, you should meet him.

245
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:36,059
温斯顿? 不 谢谢 我听说他都发霉了
Winston? No, thanks. I heard he's quite moldy.

246
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,062
我爸爸
My father.

247
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:40,036
他明天回来
He's coming back tomorrow.

248
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:43,034
你应该来吃晚饭
You should come around for dinner.

249
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:46,094
我非常乐意
I'd love to.

250
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,037
好极了
Excellent.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,026
你看来饿了
You look hungry.

252
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,001
谢谢
Thanks.

253
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:14,074
Locke告诉我们出什么事了
Locke told us what happened.

254
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:20,010
你觉得他要回她干什么?
Why do you think he wants her back?

255
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,088
我不知道
I don't know.

256
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:31,040
也许该是用你脖子上那把钥匙的时候了
Maybe it's time you used that key you've been wearing around your neck.

257
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,062
那长官的箱子里面有4把9毫米的枪
There are four 9-millimeters in the marshal's case...

258
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:35,063
哦-哦 不
Uh-uh. No.

259
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,084
我把枪分给大家
I hand them out

260
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,093
一有风吹草动 人们就会受到惊吓
someone hears something out n the jungle, gets scared...

261
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:40,009
射中自己人的机率
Chance of shooting each other

262
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,084
要比击中他的概率高多了
is higher than shooting him.

263
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:43,041
我们这里锋利的刀子已经不多了 Jack
We're beyond sharpening knives. Jack

264
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,085
我不会把枪分给那些未经过训练的人
I'm not putting guns in untrained hands.

265
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:57,018
试试看!
Trip it.

266
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,086
还不错
Not bad.

267
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:02,007
周围放四个就可以搞定了
Four of these around the perimeter will do the job.

268
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,048
我每隔20米就生一堆火
I have fires prepared at 20-meter intervals.

269
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:05,045
干得好
Excellent.

270
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:07,027
有些人自愿为大伙站岗
Some of the men have volunteered for sentry duty

271
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,006
我让他们轮流换班
I'm going to put them on rotating shifts.

272
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:11,047
算我一个
I'll take a shift.

273
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:13,055
好的
Okay.

274
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,083
当然好 就靠你了 Boone
Absolutely. We're counting on you. Boone

275
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,078
或许我们应该把她转移走
Maybe we should move her.

276
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,019
在这儿比较安全
She's safer here.

277
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,051
那座山怎么样?
What about the mountain?

278
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,094
-可能还有其它的山洞  -她在这儿更安全 Charlie
-There could be another cave.  -She's safer here. Charlie

279
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:34,061
-没人是安全的!  -嘿
-Nobody's safe!  -Hey.

280
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,071
Clare被他带走是我的错
It's my fault he took her

281
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:39,056
是我的责任 我应该照顾好她的 我应该...
I was responsible.I should've taken care of her.I should've...

282
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:45,085
Charlie 她不会有事的 好吗?
Charlie, nothing's gonna happen to her. Okay?

283
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,099
恩 好的
Yeah. Okay.

284
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:03,005
Charlie 我想我的宝贝女儿绝对同意
Well,Charlie I think my daughter would agree that

285
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:07,039
你是和我们一块儿共进晚餐的 给人印象最深的一个
you are the most impressive person who's ever had dinner with us.

286
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,011
您太过讲了 先生
My condolences, sir.

287
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,064
我不知道Lucy有没跟你提过
I don't know if Lucy mentioned it to you

288
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:14,002
我曾经也参加过乐队
but I was in a band once, you know.

289
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:17,068
乐队名叫"新教革命"
They were called The "Protestant Reformation".

290
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,044
是的..噢 很糟 是吧?
Yes. Ouch! Dreadful,huh?

291
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,066
你后来放弃了?
You gave it up, then?

292
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:24,059
那时我结婚了 Lucy也即将出生
Well, I was married, Lucy was on the way.

293
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,036
他妈妈--上帝保佑她--要我再试试
Her mum, god rest her soul, wanted me to keep trying,

294
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:31,022
但我想更实际一些
but I always wanted to be more practical.

295
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:33,006
或者说 更有责任感一些
Responsible, I guess.

296
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:36,061
你也知道 一个男人得养家 顾家
You know, a man has to provide,take care of his family.

297
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,077
得考虑到将来
A man has to think about the future.

298
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:41,000
当然还有一点 你的乐队糟糕透了
And, of course, your band was bloody awful.

299
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,059
是 那倒也是 不过那不重要
Yes, there was that too. Small detail.

300
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,000
那么 你们正在筹划新专集吗 Charlie?
So, are you working on a new album,Charlie?

301
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:50,056
我们现在关系不太融洽
We're in a bit of a hiatus right now.

302
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:58,077
Liam 我兄弟 刚生了个女儿 所以 你知道 我们...
Liam, my brother, just had a daughter.So, you know,..

303
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,049
先休息一阵儿
we're taking some time off.

304
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:07,071
事实上休息很长一段时间了
Quite a lot of time off actually

305
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:12,031
我们分开差不多有一年了
It's been a year since we were together.

306
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,036
我在考虑出单曲
I'm thinking of doing a solo project.

307
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:20,055
Liam和我其实联系并不多
Liam and I don't exactly keep in touch,

308
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:25,039
再加上我们之间还有些争执...
and there's been some problems with...

309
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:27,077
关于版税问题
royalties.

310
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:35,052
老实说 先生 呃...
The fact of the matter is, sir, uh,

311
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:41,085
我认为驱动轴乐队...已经玩完了
I think that Drive Shaft might be... dead.

312
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:48,096
你他妈接了个什么?
You took a sodding what?

313
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:52,046
-工作 Tommy  -做什么工作?
-A job.Tommy  -A job? Doing what?

314
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:54,076
推销复印机
Selling copiers.

315
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,050
你做推销复印机的工作
You took a job selling copiers?

316
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,045
我喜欢她
I like her.

317
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,052
-她是你的猎物啊  -不要那么说
-She's a moose.  -Don't say that.

318
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:01,046
你脑子发昏了 老兄?
Are you off your bleeding chump, man!

319
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:04,098
一个星期以来 我一直让你吸我的海洛因 作为投资
I've been getting you off on my scag for over a week now, on spec.

320
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,089
明白"投资"什么意思吗
Spec means "speculation."

321
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,008
是的 我知道"投资"什么意思
Yes, I know what "spec" means

322
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:11,044
现在 投资的意思是你要完成原定计划
In this case, the speculation that you'll execute your end of the plan

323
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:14,074
偷些有价值的东西 然后我去卖
and steal something of value which I can in turn sell.

324
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:17,010
等到那可怜家伙意识到东西丢了
By the time the poor hopeless bird realizes it's missing,

325
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,064
她也不会想到是你这位摇滚明星Charlie Pace
it never even occurs to her that rock star Charlie bloody Pace

326
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:23,019
干出这种偷鸡摸狗的事
could be responsible for such larceny

327
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,066
生活就还能继续了
and the bloody party continues.

328
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,089
听着 我...
Look, I...

329
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:34,027
我觉得Liam不会回来
I don't think Liam's coming back.

330
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:35,076
我得为我的将来考虑
I have to think about my future.

331
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:37,077
你的将来 说真的?
Your future? Really?

332
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,077
是的
Yes

333
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,091
你什么时候开始工作?
When do you start this job?

334
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:41,092

A full weekend without a fix.

337
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,050
周一会很"好受"的
Monday should be bloody wonderful.

338
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:51,087
我倒要看看未来待你如何 Charlie?
Let's see how the future treats you then, eh, Charlie?

339
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,017
在这儿!
Over here.

340
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:25,040
在树这边!有东西触响警铃了!
through the tree line. Something tripped the alarm.

341
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:40,051
我想我们又找到一个失踪的漂流者了
I think we found another missing castaway.

342
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:49,033
-发生什么事了?  -他还有气吗?
-What happened?  -Is he alive?

343
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:50,043
哦 老天
Oh, God.

344
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:53,020
他怎么过的我们这关?
How did he get past us?

345
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:11,047
我以为他们已经把周围布置得天衣无缝了
I thought those guys had the full-on perimeter set up.

346
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:14,010
Locke说那不管用
Locke said it didn't matter.

347
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:17,001
他从水里上来的
He came in from the water.

348
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,034
你肯定那不是个意外?
You sure it wasn't an accident?

349
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:24,080
我是说 或许那家伙只是溺水了什么的
I mean, maybe the guy just drowned or something

350
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:28,052
他的脖子被折断了 连同他的双臂 所有手指骨...
His neck was broken, both his arms, all bones in his fingers...

351
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:32,014
哦 好了 我知道了
Yeah. Okay. Got it.

352
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:36,081
看来Steve抽中了那支短签
Guess old Steve drew the short straw.

353
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:40,023
老兄 他叫Scott

358
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:08,056
抱歉我一直叫你Steve
I'm sorry I kept calling you Steve, man.

359
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,062
我想该说"阿门"了吧
Um... Amen, I guess.

360
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:17,063
我不知道该如何收尾
I don't know how to end these.

361
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:36,062
你好
Hi. Um...

362

为什么大家都盯着我看?
Why is everyone staring at me?

363
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,015
我没有盯着你看
I'm not staring at you.

364

00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:51,055
难道没人告诉过你?
You mean nobody's told you?

368
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,094
告诉我什么?
Told me what?

369
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:56,093
为什么?!
Why?

370
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,078
为什么你要骗我?!
Why did you lie to me?

371

是吗 你还有什么没告诉我?!
Yeah, What else didn't you tell me?

373
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,058
我只是觉得以你的记忆力没有什么你能做所的
I just thought with your memory there wasn't anything that you could do.

374
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,012
没有什么我能做的?!!
Nothing I could do?

375
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:11,082
你干吗老让我蒙在鼓里 Charlie?
Why would you keep me in the dark, Charlie?

376
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:15,007
我已经失去记忆了
I'm already in the dark.

377
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:17,046

Sorry.

You've been on stage in front of thousands of screaming fans.

This is just some men who want to buy a silly copy machine.

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,058
你觉得你能否追踪到他?
You think you can track him?

420
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,047
什么?再说一遍?
What, I'm sorry?

421
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:54,045
我们知道他在哪儿袭击Jin和Charlie
We know where he attacked Jin and Charlie.

422
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,041
你觉得你能不能追踪到他?
Do you think you could pick up the trail?

423
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:58,037
恩 可能吧 但我不会这么做
Maybe, but I wouldn't.

424
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:00,057
你不会这么做?
You wouldn't?

425
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,092
Jack  我不是冷血动物
Jack, I'm not a cold man.

426
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,074
我同样为大家的损失感到痛心
I feel for the loss of one of our own.

427
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:07,075
但基本原则没有改变
But nothing fundamental's changed.

428
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:10,097
不管他是谁 从哪里来 我们都在Ethan的地盘上
Whoever he is, wherever he comes from, we're on Ethan's turf.

429
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:12,049
他占有优势
He has the advantage.

430
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,068
对他而言  我们只不过是一群...
To him we're nothing more than a bunch of

431
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:17,098
拿着尖木棍 吓破了胆的白痴
scared idiots with sharp sticks.

432
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:23,014
要是我说我有办法把优势夺回来呢?
What if I told you that I had a way to get the advantage back?

433
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:26,082
那我就要问那是什么方法了 Jack?
Then I would ask, "What way might that be?" Jack?

434
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:57,010
为什么 医生 你一直瞒着我们
Why, doctor, you've been holding out on us.

435
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,042
我想你应该知道怎么用这东西吧
I'm guessing you know how to handle one of these.

436
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:23,043
你们疯了?
Are you insane?

437
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,014
这是我们最好的机会了 Charlie
It's the best chance we have.Charlie

438
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:26,027
没门儿
No bloody way.

439
00:28:26,028 --> 00:28:28,027
如果我们想要抓住Ethan 就得想办法把他引出来
If you want to capture Ethan, we have to ensnare him.

440
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:30,097
唯一的方法就是把他想要的东西给他
and the only way to do that is by giving him what he wants.

441
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:32,046
你根本不知道自己在讲什么
You have no idea what you talking about

442
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,083
这家伙...他会把你们都杀了的
This guy...he will kill all of you.

443
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:36,092
-你们无法保护自己  -Charlie
-You can't protect yourself...  -Charlie

444
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:39,017
不用你替我说话
I can talk for myself

445
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:43,076
Claire 他们要把你作诱饵
Claire They want to use you as bait.

446
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,074
我不记得Ethan
I don't remember Ethan.

447
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:49,045
我也不记得他对我做过什么
I don't remember what he did to me.

448
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:52,061
但要是我能够阻止他伤害其它人
But if I can help stop him from hurting anyone else,

449
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:55,026
我就必须真么做
I have to do that.

450
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:00,015
我和你们一块儿去 你说有四把枪
I'm coming with you. You said there were four guns.

451
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:03,030
你用过枪吗 Charlie?
You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?

452
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,082
好了 我们动手吧
All right, we should do this.

453
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,021
让我们想个策略
Let's figure out a game plan.

454
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:17,012
好的 Sayid 军人
All right, Sayid, soldier.

455
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:19,020
Locke  你当猎人
Locke, you're the hunter.

456
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:24,081
让我证明给你们看 C815运转的有多么神速 拿...
Allow me to demonstrate the awesome speed of the C815 using...

457
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:27,027
...你们的...
...one of your...

458
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:31,013
...技术手册来示范一下
...technical manuals.

459
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:47,052
没问题 可能是...
Not a problem. There's probably...

460
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:50,083
...这儿写着...
something in here.

461
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:57,012
没什么能...
Nothing to...

462
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,096
马上 马上
One second. One second.

463
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:01,005
稍等一下
Bear with me.

464
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,074
Charlie说的对
Charlie's right.

465
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:20,058
什么?
About what?

466
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:25,013
我们有四把枪 就得配四个人
We have four guns. We should have four men.

467
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,093
帮忙?
Help?

468
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,028
我?
Moi?

469
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:34,069
你到底知道不知道怎么用枪?
You know how to handle a gun or not?

470
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,053
哦 我想至少有只北极熊知道我会用
Well,I know at least one polar bear seems to think so.

471
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:47,046
这家伙你哪儿弄来的 老兄?
Where'd you get the hardware, hoss?

472
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:51,003
我也想去
I wanna come.

473
00:30:51,004 --> 00:30:52,066
抱歉 没枪了
Sorry. We're out of guns.

474
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:55,095
没有枪就不能去那里
And no one goes out there unarmed.

475
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,084
你有多少弹药?
How much ammo you got?

476
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,072
差不多100发
Hundred rounds, give or take.

477
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:06,020
都是9毫米的 对吧?
All nines, right?

478
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,067
9毫米? 枪?
Nine millimeters? The guns?

479
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:10,097
是的 怎么了?
Yeah. Why?

480
00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:14,003
如果这位女士想去...
'Cause if the lady wants to come...

481
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,078
这是我早些时候从长官那儿拿的
Lifted this off the marshal back in the old days.

482
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,066
你还记得他吧?
You remember him, don't you?

483
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:26,086
阴沉的家伙 下颚比较方的那个?
Surly guy, kind of a square jaw?

484
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:28,015
别着一把9毫米西格手枪?
Carried a Sig nine?

485
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:30,016
是的 我记得是你向他开的枪...
Yeah. I remember you shot him.

486
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:32,044
并且打偏了
And missed.

487
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:34,030
是的 好吧...
Yeah, well...

488
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:36,081
过去的事就不提了
bygones.

489
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:38,094
不管怎样...
And, hell...

490
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:41,088
五把枪总比四把枪好
five guns are better than four.

491
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:00,024
我们五个人分布在你周围
You'll be surrounded at five points.

492
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:02,053
每个人都会在你的视线之内
Everyone will be in visual contact with you.

493
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:06,004
一定要待在我告诉你的那地方
Make sure you stay in the area I've shown you.

494
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:09,033
还要记住 不到最后时刻不要开枪
And remember, the guns are a measure of the last resort.

495
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:11,096
我们要抓活的
We want him alive.

496
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:34,008
在这边!这边!
Over here.

497
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,033
Jack抓住他了!
Jack's got him.

498
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:41,096
管好你们的枪 不要射击
Hold your fire. Don't shoot!

499
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:44,022
我们要抓活的
We want him alive.

500
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:55,021
Claire!

501
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,038
你没事吧?
You all right?

502
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:58,045
是的
Yeah.

503
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,004
在这儿!
Over here.

504
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:04,042
-嘿! 不要开枪!  -放松
-Hey! Hold your fire!  -Easy!

505
00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:23,010
致命一击 胜出 干得好 医生
Winner by a knockout. Nice one, doc.

506
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:27,085
现在有人告诉我这狗杂种是谁了吧
Now maybe somebody can tell me who or what this son of a bitch is.

507
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:32,082
呃 呃 丛林小子 想都别想
Uh-uh-uh, jungle boy, not even for one sec.

508
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:47,018
Charlie!

509
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:34,032
你为什么这么做 Charlie?
Why did you do it, Charlie?

510
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:41,009
因为他死有应得
'Cause he deserved to die.

511
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:46,007
他本可以告诉我们他从哪儿来的
He could've told us where he came from.

512
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:48,019
他要Claire做什么 为什么要把她带走
What he wanted with Claire, why he even took her

513
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,066
你真以为他会告诉我们 Jack?
Do you really think he would've told us anything Jack?

514
00:36:55,031 --> 00:37:00,017
我不会再让那畜生接近她半步
I wasn't gonna let that animal anywhere near her again.

515
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,049
绝不
Ever.

516
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:23,046
Lucy

517
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:25,099
对不起 我一直问题缠身
I'm sorry. I've been having some problems.

518
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,021
请你听我解释一下...
If I could just explain...

519
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:28,062
走吧 Charlie
Leave, Charlie.

520
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:30,060
Lucy

521
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:32,014
我错了
I made a mistake.

522
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,092
你做错了?
You made a mistake?

523
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:36,042
我父亲的销售经理来我家
My father's sales manager comes to my house

524
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:37,079
来归还那香烟盒
to return a cigarette case

525
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,075
那个急诊大夫从你西装口袋里拿出来的香烟盒
that the EMTs pulled from your suit pocket at the bloody hospital

526
00:37:40,076 --> 00:37:43,060
闻起来还有你恶心的味道
and it still smells of your sick.

527
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,076
-Lucy 我不是故意要...  -哦 你是故意的 Charlie
-I didn't mean...  -Oh, you meant to.Charlie

528
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:49,000
你从一开始就预谋好了
You meant to from the start.

529
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,019
你是个骗子
You're a liar.

530
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,005
我这么相信你 你却骗我
I believed you, and you lied!

531
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:54,023
我以为你想...
I thought you wanted to...

532
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,045
你说过...
You said...

533
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:58,032
你这自私的狗杂种!
You selfish bastard!

534
00:37:58,033 --> 00:37:59,084
Lucy 能不能让我解释...
Lucy If I can just explain...

535
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:01,015
告诉我一件事就行了
Just tell me one thing,

536
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:03,038
而且你绝不许再骗我
and don't you dare lie to me.

537
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,056
我知道你为什么假装喜欢我了
I get why you pretended to like me.

538
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:09,072
我知道你为什么要偷...
I understand why you stole,

539
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:12,070
因为你是个瘾君子
because you're a junkie,

540
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:19,011
但我不明白你为什么要接那份工作
but I don't understand why you took the job.

541
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:23,045
你为什么要接那份工作 Charlie?
Why did you take the job, Charlie?

542
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:29,088
我想 我...
I guess I...

543
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:32,015
我...
I...

544
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:39,083
我想得到大家的尊重
...wanted to be respectable.

545
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:46,034
我想要你知道 我能照顾好你
I wanted you to think that I could take care of you.

546
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,045
你谁都照顾不好
You'll never take care of anyone.

547
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:38,083
我记起花生酱了
I remember peanut butter.

548
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,099
我怎么会记得花生酱?
Why do I remember peanut butter?

549
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:51,084
事实上 那是想象出来的花生酱
It was imaginary peanut butter, actually.

550
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:58,032
我不知道我怎么了
I don't know what happened to me.

551
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,043
我很害怕
I'm scared.

552
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:14,048
我愿意信任你
I want to trust you.

553
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:27,043
晚安  Charlie
Good night, Charlie.

554
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:30,025
晚安  Claire
Good night, Claire.

555
