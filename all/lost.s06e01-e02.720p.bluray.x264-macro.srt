00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,651
"迷失"前情回顾...
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:06,352
他们来了 开始争斗
They come. They fight.

3
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:09,463
他们毁灭 最后腐烂
They destroy. They corrupt.

4
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:10,692
结局总是相同的
It always ends the same.

5
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,033
但是只结束一次
It only ends once.

6
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:17,125
在这之前所有的事情都是过程
Anything that happens before that is just progress.

7
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,253
我不会杀Jacob的 Ben
I'm not gonna kill Jacob, Ben.

8
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,571
你会
You are.

9
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,968
- 照我说的做 Ben - 我只想让你明白一件事情
- Do what I asked you to, Ben. - I want you to understand one thing.

10
00:00:26,468 --> 00:00:27,511
你有机会选择的
You have a choice.

11
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:32,981
他们来了
They're coming.

12
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:40,128
在天鹅站工地的达摩组织的人们...
The Dharma folks at the swan worksite...

13
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:41,813
他们会在地上钻井
They're gonna drill into the ground

14
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:44,539
意外的钻入了一块巨大的隐藏能量中
And accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy.

15
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,937
我觉得我能消除这股能量
I think I can negate that energy.

16
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:51,963
- 我会去引爆氢弹的 - 如果我们按照Faraday说的做 飞机就不会失事
- I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb. - If we can do what Faraday said, plane never crashes.

17
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:54,575
815号航班会在洛杉矶降落

Hurry up, Doc! What are you waitin' for?!

19
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:11,201
我们钻到能量块了!
We hit the pocket!

20
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:19,240
Juliet啊

21
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:24,068
- 我抓住你了 不 不要松手! - 啊!

22
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:25,986

快点 你这混蛋!
Come on, you son of a bitch!

27
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,013
饮料还满意么?
So how's the drink?

28
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:24,172
呃...
Uh...

29
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:25,692
还不错
It's good.

30
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:27,894
这个反应可不够强烈啊
That's not a very strong reaction.

31
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:31,291
好吧 这个... 也不是个烈性饮料
Well, it's... it's not a very strong drink.

32
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:37,380
- 谁也别告诉 - 这是我们的秘密
- Don't tell anyone. - It'll be our secret.

33
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,452
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

34
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:50,724
机长已将"系好安全带"指示打开
The captain has turned on the "fasten seat belts" sign.

35
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:54,428
- 系好你们的安全带 - 这是正常情况
- And keep your seat belts fastened. - It's normal.

36
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,763
我丈夫说了 这飞机想呆在天上
My husband said the planes want to stay in the air.

37
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,225
听起来像个聪明人
Sounds like a smart man.

38
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:02,737
绝对是的
You be sure and tell him that

39
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:05,563
你可以等他从厕所回来把这句话告诉他
when he gets back from the bathroom.

40
00:03:05,563 --> 00:03:07,857
好啊 他不在的时候 我会陪着你的
Well, I'll keep you company until he does.

41
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:09,281
别担心
Don't worry.

42
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,891
你可以放开了
You can let go now.

43

没事了 你... 你可以放手了
It's okay. You...you can let go.

44
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:50,858
- 看来我们成功了 - 是啊 我们当然成功了
- Looks like we made it. - Yeah. We sure did.

45
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:53,673
很抱歉出现了突然的撞击 大伙
Sorry about the unexpected bumps, folks.

46
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:54,935
我们刚刚遇到一块扰动气流
We just hit a pocket of rough air.

47
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,051
之后的旅途会很平稳
It should be a smooth ride from here on out.

48
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:01,620
下次提醒我要憋着 好么?
Remind me to hold it next time, will ya?

49
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,512
我在厕所差点死过去
I almost died in that bathroom.

50
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:09,680
我终于知道衣服在被烘干的时候是什么感觉了
Now I know how the laundry feels when it's in the dryer.

51
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,691
我想你了
I missed you.

52
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:17,895
我也想你了 美女
I missed you, too, beautiful.

00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,435
- 对不起 - 哦 对不起 伙计 这是你的座位?
- Excuse me. - Oh, I'm sorry, mate. Is this your seat?

- 乘务员说是空的 - 不 不 我是坐在窗边的
- The stewardess said it was empty. - No. No, I'm at the window.

Oh, right.

56

那么 伙计 你介意我坐这儿么?
Listen, mate, do you mind if I sit here?

57

It's just the fella next to me has been snoring

不
No.

86

那是天鹅舱...
That's the swan hatch...

87
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:31,107
Desmond炸过之后的
After Desmond blew it up.

88
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:34,902
我猜我们没在1977年 哈?
Guess we're not in 1977, huh?

89
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,854

那是该死的天鹅站舱口...
That's the damn swan hatch...

99
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:35,474
爆炸过后就像是我们留下来的一样
Blown up just like we left it

100
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,712
在我们开始穿越时空之前!

105
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,052
而Juliet却死了
Except Juliet's dead.

00:13:57,843 --> 00:14:01,253
你知道吗 你真不该告诉其他人你中奖了
You know, you really shouldn't tell people you won the lottery.

142
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:03,338
是吗? 为什么?
Yeah? Why not?

143
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:06,779
因为他们会利用你 这就是原因
Cause they'll take advantage of you. That's why not.

144
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,085
谢谢你的忠告 兄弟 但这不会发生的
Thanks for the advice, dude, but it's not gonna happen.

145
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:12,660
不会 是吗?
It's not, huh?

146
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,039
是的 我运气向来很好
Nope. Nothing bad ever happens to me.

147
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,572
我是世界上最幸运的人
I'm the luckiest guy alive.

148
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:31,585
刚刚怎么了?
What just happened?

149
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:33,254
我看到了一阵闪光
I found a flashlight.

150
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:36,632
兄弟 谁在乎啊? 白昼瞬间成黑夜了
Dude, who cares? The sky just went from day to night.

151
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:39,176
- 怎么回事啊?! - 我猜我们是穿越时空了
- What happened?! - I think we moved through time.

152
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,053
你怎么知道?
How do you know that?

153
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:44,383
白色闪光 头痛 听不见声音
White flash. Headache. Can't hear.

154
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,101
- 我以前也发生过 - Jack和其他人呢?
- Happened to me before. - What about Jack and everyone else?

155
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,835
- 他们也穿越时空了吗? - 我不知道
- Did they move through time, too? - I don't know.

156
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:51,600
他们开了另外一辆货车去工地了
They took one of the other vans and went up to the worksite.

157
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,696
接着我就听到了枪声...
And then I heard gunfire...

158
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:55,497
- 嘘! - 你说过我们的飞机再也不会坠到这个岛上的!
- Shh! - You said that our plane would never crash on this island!

159
00:14:55,497 --> 00:15:00,382
- 听到了吗 兄弟? 是Sawyer - 呆这儿陪着Sayid
- You hear that, dude? It's Sawyer. - Stay here with Sayid.

160
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,285
炸弹肯定爆炸了
The bomb must've gone off.

161
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:09,205
你觉得原子弹爆炸了以后我们还能站在这儿?
You think an atom bomb went off, we'd still be standing here?!

162
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,263
我不懂
I don't know.

163
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:13,866
没错! 你不懂! 你终于承认不懂了!
That's right! You don't! For once, you don't know!

164
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:16,337
Jack啊!
Jack!

165
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:18,047
Sayid需要帮助
Sayid needs help.

166
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,012
- 他在哪儿? - 在货车那儿 Hurley陪着他
- Where is he? - With Hurley at the van.

167
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,139
- 两分钟路程 - 救命
- Two minutes away. - Help.

168
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:23,309
他还在流血 我们不知道该怎么办
He's still bleeding. We don't know what to do.

169
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,006
救命
Help me.

170
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,211
怎么说啊 医生?
So what do you say, doc?

171
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,382
又想到一个好主意来救Sayid了?
Got another great idea to save Sayid?

172
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,806
- 没准周围又埋了一颗核弹 - 嘿 闭嘴!
- Maybe there's a nuke laying around. - Hey, shut up!

173
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,622
救命
Help.

174
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:49,535
Juliet啊
Juliet!

175
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:50,864
James吗?
James?

176
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,860
噢 天呐
Oh, my god.

177
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,318
Juliet啊!
Juliet!

178
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,929
哦 天呐 哦 天呐 恶心死了
Oh, god. Oh, god, this is gross.

179
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:07,748
别担心 兄弟
Don't worry, dude.

180
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,562
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be fine.

181
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:14,088
我死后...
When I die...

182
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:20,240
你觉得我会发生什么?
What do you think will happen to me?

183
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,336
别... 别说话了 哥们
Just... just try not to talk, dude.

184
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:25,495
我虐待过多少人自己都记不清了
I've tortured more people than I can remember.

185
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,936
我杀人
I murdered.

186
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,700
不管我去哪儿...
Wherever I'm going...

187
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,486
都不会是好地方
It can't be very pleasant.

188
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:37,465
- Sayid 行了 - 我活该
- Sayid, come on. - I deserve it.

189
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,505
谁?
Hello?

190
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,927
Jin吗?
Jin?

191
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,391
Jin啊
Jin!

192
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,457
我有枪的!
I've got a gun!

193
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:05,191
我也知道怎么用!
And I know how to shoot it!

194
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,868
你好 Hugo
Hello, Hugo.

195
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:37,989
有时间吗?
You got a minute?

196
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,598

你盯着他们干吗?

197
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,560

他们看起来挺开心的

198
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,712

把衣服扣上

199
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:16,484
你在浪费时间 伙计
You're wasting your time, man.

200
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,585
这架飞机要是在大海中间坠落的话
This plane goes down in the ocean way out here,

201
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:24,242
我想我们的生存几率绝对为零
I think our chances of survival are exactly zero.

202
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:28,517
实际上 平静的海面再加一个好的飞行员
Actually, in calm seas w-with a good pilot,

203
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:30,584
我们可以在水面迫降的
We could survive a water landing.

204
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,147
还有 嗯 燃料罐浮力很大的
And, uh, the fuel tanks are buoyant enough

205
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:35,618
完全可以支持到我们上救生筏
To keep us afloat until we got in the life rafts.

206
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,089
怎么了?
What?

207
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,175
没什么 你知道的可真不少
No, it's just impressive you know that.

208
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,647
你在澳大利亚干吗了?
What were you doing in Australia?

209
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,118
生意还是度假?
Business or pleasure?

210
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:48,454
度假 你呢?
Pleasure. You?

211
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:52,697
我去处理一下和我妹妹糟糕的关系
I went down to get my sister out of a bad relationship

212
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,837
结果是她不买我的帐
That it turns out she didn't want to get out of.

213
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,401
如此...
So...

214
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,424
我就在这儿了
Here I am.

215
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:03,761
那么说 你是来澳洲度假的了?
So what, you were just down under for vacation?

216
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,576
实际上 我是来徒步旅行的
Actually, I went on a walkabout.

217
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:08,964
是吗?
Really?

218
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,977
就像... 像鳄鱼邓迪似的?
Like... like Crocodile Cundee?&

219
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:13,885
不 不太像
No, not exactly.

220
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,012
但... 但是 嗯 相当激烈了
But... but, uh, it was pretty intense.

221
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:18,932
我们... 我们在内陆呆了10天
We... we spent ten days in the outback

222
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,674
嗯 除了包和刀什么都不带
And, uh, nothing but our packs and our knives.

223
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:24,236
我们燃起篝火 在星空下入睡
We slept under the stars and made our own fires,

224
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:26,150
自己打猎
Hunted our own food.

225
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,045
哇
Wow.

226
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,737
我要是两天不带电话就活不了
I wouldn't make it two days without my cell phone.

227
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,741
你不是在跟我开玩笑吧 对吗?
You're not pulling my leg, are ya?

228
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,556
我为什么要跟你开玩笑呢?
Why would I pull your leg?

229
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:45,291
我的事完了之后 就跟你混一阵
This thing goes down, I'm sticking with you.

230
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:21,160
你不用盯着火看了
You can stop staring at the fire.

231
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,415
Jacob死了
Jacob's gone.

232
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,683
他死了
He's gone.

233
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:31,227
他为什么不还手?
Why didn't he fight back?

234
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,752
他为什么让我杀他?
Why did he let me just kill him?

235
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:38,286
我想是他知道他已经被打败了
I guess he knew that he was beaten.

236
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,896
Ben啊...
Ben...

237
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:45,440
我要你出去
I want you to go outside

238
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,048
告诉Richard 我想跟他谈谈
And tell Richard that I need to talk to him.

239
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,072
跟他谈... 什么?
Talk to him about... What?

240
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:56,315
那是我和Richard的事
That's between me and Richard.

241
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:04,145
- 没有别的原因 - 不 事情不应该那样的
- There's no other reason. - No, that's not how it's gonna be.

242
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:06,856
- 你应该... - 你不能进去
- You have to... - you're not going in there.

243
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:10,370
听我说 我已经决定了 现在我要你...
Listen to me. I already did. Now I'm asking you to...

244
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,633
到那边去...
Body over by the...

245
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:16,043
只要退回去一点 好吗?
Just back up a little. Okay?

246
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,733
他们是谁?
Who are they?

247
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:21,818
除了那些
Other than the fact

248
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:24,634
和我们一起在Ajira航班上的人
that I know they were on the Ajira flight with us,

249
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,761
我所知道的就是 他们打晕了我
All I know is they knocked me out

250
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:28,638
把我关进了某个小屋
And dragged my ass to some cabin,

251
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,995
他们很快又把屋子给烧了 然后
Which they promptly burned, then...

252
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:35,248
把我和棺材里那个死人又带到了这里
Brought me here along with the dead guy in the box.

253
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:38,064
他们说他们是好人
They say they're the good guys.

254
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:43,379
我也不信
I'm not buying it either.

255
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:48,856
听我说 嘿! 听我说 给我仔细听着
Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me, and listen carefully.

256
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:50,534
除非Jacob邀请 否则谁也不能进去
No one goes in there unless Jacob invites them in.

257
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:54,739
Richard 我们之所以来这里 就是因为Jacob邀请了我们
Richard, that's why we're here, because Jacob invited us.

258
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,327
问我那该死的雕像下边有什么
Asking me what's in the shadow of the damn statue

259
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,598
- 并不代表你是头儿 - 那谁是呢?
- Doesn't mean you're in charge. - Then who is?

260
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,759
Richard啊
Richard.

261
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,068
嘿 Ben
Ben.

262
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:06,477
里面怎么了?
What happened in there?

263
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:08,249
一切都好
Everything's fine.

264
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,721
John想跟你谈谈
John wants to speak to you.

265
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:13,309
- Jacob还好吧? - 不好意思 你哪位?
- Is Jacob all right? - I'm sorry. Who are you?

266
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:16,437
- 回答她的问题 Ben - 哦 那当然 Jacob很好
- Answer her question, Ben. - Well, of course Jacob's all right.

267
00:22:16,437 --> 00:22:20,545
他们两个都在里面 John想跟你谈谈
They're both together inside. John just wants to talk to you.

268
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:23,496
- John想跟我谈谈? - 是的
- John wants to talk to me? - That's right.

269
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:26,635
Richard 你干什么? 我不明白
Richard, what are you doing? I don't understand.

270
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:28,142
哦 跟John谈话我很高兴
Well, I'm happy to talk to John.

271
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:32,338
但在我跟他谈之前 你最好先跟他谈谈
But before I do, maybe you should talk to him first.

272
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,591
坚持住 Juliet! 我们马上到!
Hang on, Juliet! We're coming!

273
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,253
呃!
Uhh!

274
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:08,107
Jin 手电筒
Jin. Flashlight.

275
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:15,378
把这根柱子移开 我就能下去了
We can move this beam. Think I can get down there.

276
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:33,193
唉! 这太重了 得拿点东西把这个拉起来 Jin!
Uhh! Too heavy. We need something to pull it. Jin!

277
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:36,566

283
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:56,805
刚好能把我送回岛上的机票

284
00:23:56,805 --> 00:24:00,234
你怎么知道将要发生的事?
How'd you know that was gonna happen?

285

What are they saying, they own the entire Outback?

697
01:09:18,323 --> 01:09:19,702
真是扯淡
That's just stupid.

698
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,731
把他们搞定 好吗?
Have'em cover it, okay?

699
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:22,700
她就要出海关了
She's gonna be coming out of customs,

700
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:24,721
所以我希望你们走另一个门
so I want you guys to take the other door.

701
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:28,173
我还没拿到图斯丁库存报告
Oh, I didn't get the, uh, Tustin inventory report yet.

702
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,695
快行动吧
Get on it.

703
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,205
嘿!
Hey!

704
01:09:41,647 --> 01:09:43,183
嘿! 看点路!
Hey! Watch it!

705
01:09:44,115 --> 01:09:45,846
开车! 快开车!
Go! Go now!

706
01:09:45,919 --> 01:09:47,921
女士 已经有人搭我车了
Lady, I already have a customer.

707
01:09:47,994 --> 01:09:49,485
我说快开车
I said go.

708
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:52,081
嘿 你在干吗?
Hey, what are you doing?

709
01:09:52,425 --> 01:09:54,104
现在开车!
Go now!

710
01:09:57,201 --> 01:10:00,857
嘿! 嘿! 停车!
Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

711
01:10:20,904 --> 01:10:23,540
我想你们可能需要补充点能量
Thought you might like a little something to eat or drink.

712
01:10:23,582 --> 01:10:27,346
Zack Emma 把剩下的人带过来
Zack, Emma, then take the rest to the people over there.

713
01:10:27,488 --> 01:10:29,087
谢谢
Thank you.

714
01:10:31,737 --> 01:10:33,335
把他们带来
Just drop 'em in here.

715
01:10:39,762 --> 01:10:42,600
嘿 发生什么了?
Hey. What happened?

716
01:10:43,242 --> 01:10:45,723
他们在丛林里抓住我们了
They jumped us in the jungle.

717
01:10:45,964 --> 01:10:47,763
他在他们用岩石砸他前
He took four of them out

718
01:10:47,794 --> 01:10:50,796
解救了他们其中四人
before one of them hit him with a damn rock.

719
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:57,731
你 跟我来
You. Come with me.

720
01:10:59,437 --> 01:11:01,050
跟你去哪儿?
Come with you where?

721
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,710
他想知道Jacob告诉你什么了
He wants to know what Jacob told you.

722
01:11:17,152 --> 01:11:19,213
他叫我来这里
He told me to come here,

723
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:22,501
说你们能救Sayid
said you guys would save Sayid.

724
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:27,538
他已经救不活了
He was beyond saving.

725
01:11:28,069 --> 01:11:29,615
等一下
Wait a sec.

726
01:11:29,656 --> 01:11:32,243
你没有翻译我对他说的话
You're not translating anything I say to him,

727
01:11:32,284 --> 01:11:34,866
也就是说 你完全听懂了 老兄
which means you totally understand me, dude.

728
01:11:34,897 --> 01:11:39,018
我不喜欢说英语
I don't like the way English tastes on my tongue.

729
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:44,067
- Jacob什么时候来这里? - 你什么意思?
- When's Jacob getting here? - What do you mean?

730
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:45,861
他要回到寺庙吗?
Is he coming to the temple?

731
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:48,869
我不这样认为 伙计
I really don't think that's gonna happen, man.

732
01:11:50,142 --> 01:11:51,652
为什么不?
Why not?

733
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:54,706
你知道... 因为他死了
You know... because he's dead.

734
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,436
什么?
What?

735
01:11:59,877 --> 01:12:01,915
你们不知道?
You guys didn't know?

736
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:11,558
各就各位!
Everyone to your posts!

737
01:12:11,589 --> 01:12:14,936
上城墙! 准备好灰!
On the walls! Prepare the ash!

738
01:12:25,677 --> 01:12:28,309
北面去十个人!
Ten men to the north side!

739
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:32,261
发警报!
Send the warning!

740
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:36,475
点上!
Light it!

741
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,012
我们不是要待在这里吧?
Guess we're not getting out of here, huh?

742
01:12:53,085 --> 01:12:56,619
这不是要困住你们 是防止他进来
This isn't to keep you in. It's to keep him out.

743
01:12:56,734 --> 01:12:59,539
"他"是谁?
"Him" who?

744
01:13:12,605 --> 01:13:14,486
你是什么东西?
What are you?

745
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:18,673
我不是东西 Ben 我是人
I'm not a "what," Ben. I'm a "who."

746
01:13:18,714 --> 01:13:20,831
你就是那个怪物
You're the monster.

747
01:13:20,862 --> 01:13:24,031
别纠缠于名字了
Let's not resort to name-calling.

748
01:13:31,017 --> 01:13:33,563
你利用我
You used me.

749
01:13:34,781 --> 01:13:37,061
你自己杀不了他
You couldn't kill him yourself,

750
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:40,028
所以骗我来做
so you made me do it.

751
01:13:40,059 --> 01:13:43,233
我没有骗你做任何事
I didn't make you do anything.

752
01:13:46,336 --> 01:13:48,194
你应该知道...
You should know...

753
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,003
当你杀他的时候 他很困惑
he was very confused when you killed him.

754
01:13:52,034 --> 01:13:54,891
我难以相信Jacob会感到困惑
I seriously doubt that Jacob was ever confused.

755
01:13:54,923 --> 01:13:57,338
我不是说Jacob
I'm not talking about Jacob.

756
01:13:59,529 --> 01:14:01,863
我是说John Locke
I'm talking about John Locke.

757
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,475
你想知道他那时在想什么吗 当你...
Do you wanna know what he was thinking while you...

758
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:10,624
残忍地勒死他的时候 Benjamin?
choked the life out of him, Benjamin?

759
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:14,025
他临死前头脑中想的是什么?
What the last thought that ran through his head was?

760
01:14:14,056 --> 01:14:17,965
"我不明白"
"I don't understand."

761
01:14:20,793 --> 01:14:23,685
这是否是你听过的最可怜的事情?
Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard?

762
01:14:26,169 --> 01:14:28,341
不过 从某方面看 这也讲得过去
But it's fitting in a way.

763
01:14:28,344 --> 01:14:31,232
因为John第一次踏上这小岛的时候
Because when John first came to the island,

764
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:33,849
他是一个内心极度悲伤的人
he was a very sad man.

765
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:35,653
一位受害者
A victim

766
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:38,854
在得知自己力有不及时 伤心欲绝...
shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do...

767
01:14:38,886 --> 01:14:40,981
即使这是事实
even though they were right.

768
01:14:42,013 --> 01:14:43,797
他软弱
He was weak

769
01:14:43,828 --> 01:14:48,605
可悲 内心支零破碎
and pathetic and irreparably broken.

770
01:14:49,436 --> 01:14:52,566
但是尽管如此
But despite all that,

771
01:14:52,597 --> 01:14:55,246
他仍有闪光之处
there was something admirable about him.

772
01:14:55,277 --> 01:14:59,698
他是众人中 唯一一个不愿离开小岛的人
He was the only one of them who didn't want to leave.

773
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:01,888
唯一一个意识到
The only one who realized

774
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:05,237
他已抛弃的岛外生活是
how pitiful the life he'd left behind

775
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:07,800
多么地可悲
actually was.

776
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,488
嗯
Hmm.

777
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,004
你想要什么?
What do you want?

778
01:15:18,846 --> 01:15:21,287
这个 极具讽刺意味 Ben
Well, that's the great irony here, Ben,

779
01:15:21,328 --> 01:15:22,337
因为...
because...

780
01:15:22,968 --> 01:15:26,638
我想要的 是John Locke唯一不想要的
I want the one thing that John Locke didn't.

781
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:32,800
我要回家
I want to go home.

782
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,345
再见 兄弟
Goodbye, dude.

783
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:49,051
你要是想说会儿话
If you ever wanna talk,

784
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,538
我就在旁边
I'm around.

785
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:02,931
什么?
What?

786
01:16:05,851 --> 01:16:06,850
没什么
Nothing.

787
01:16:21,966 --> 01:16:23,620
嘿
Hey.

788
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,634
我们在哪?
Where are we?

789
01:16:29,076 --> 01:16:31,065
在寺庙里
We're in a temple.

790
01:16:31,297 --> 01:16:34,075
我们再次被The Others抓了
We got caught by The Others again.

791
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:34,966
是啊
Yeah.

792
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:39,093
只有这次 他们是在保护我们
Only this time, they're protecting us.

793
01:16:39,135 --> 01:16:42,020
我这样认为
I think.

794
01:16:42,051 --> 01:16:43,351
当然了
Of course they are.

795
01:16:43,383 --> 01:16:45,145
你还好吗?
You all right?

796
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,176
十分抱歉
I'm so sorry.

797
01:17:09,255 --> 01:17:11,757
你知道你在舱门那里说了什么吗?
You know what you said back at the hatch?

798
01:17:12,488 --> 01:17:14,828
他只是想帮助我们
He's just trying to help us.

799
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:18,821
我不会杀死Jack
I am not gonna kill Jack.

800
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,472
他理应坐在这块岩石上自我谴责
He deserves to suffer on this rock

801
01:17:23,545 --> 01:17:26,621
和我们其余的人一样
just like the rest of us.

802
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:31,342
是啊
Yeah.

803
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:36,607
我知道 而且... 你以为我能预知这事的发生吗?
I know, and... you think I knew this was gonna happen?

804
01:17:37,048 --> 01:17:40,121
我这么快计划好 就是因为想要结束它
I scheduled it so soon because want to get it over with.

805
01:17:40,162 --> 01:17:42,402
所有乘客请注意...
Attention all passengers...

806
01:17:43,044 --> 01:17:44,008
我不知道 妈妈
I don't know, Mom.

807
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,379
他没在这里 所以我不知道让你跟他们如何解释
He's not here, so I can't tell you what to tell them,

808
01:17:46,452 --> 01:17:50,354
只能告诉你 我们没有他办不了事情
other than we can't have the service without him.

809
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:51,743
嗯
Yeah.

810
01:17:52,074 --> 01:17:55,488
如果有新消息 我会打电话给你的
I will call you if I hear anything.

811
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,818
你掉了什么?
What did you lose?

812
01:18:00,455 --> 01:18:01,831
你说什么?
Excuse me?

813
01:18:02,123 --> 01:18:05,387
哦 他们弄丢了我一个包 你呢?
Oh, they lost one of my bags. What about you?

814
01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:09,234
要是我告诉你 你肯定不会信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

815
01:18:09,966 --> 01:18:10,903
试试呗
Try me.

816
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,299
他们弄丢了我爸爸
They lost my father.

817
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:17,762
什么?
I'm sorry?

818
01:18:18,004 --> 01:18:19,839
他几天前在澳大利亚过世
He died in Australia a couple days ago,

819
01:18:19,901 --> 01:18:23,094
然后 呃 我坐飞机来接他的遗体
and, um, I flew down to get him.

820
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,868
节哀顺变
My condolences.

821
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:30,792
哎
Yo.

822
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:33,063
棺材本应在悉尼上机
The coffin was supposed to go on the plane in Sydney,

823
01:18:33,094 --> 01:18:34,786
然而却没有
but it didn't.

824
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:36,308
显然 他被落在了运输途中
Apparently, he's somewhere in transit,

825
01:18:36,391 --> 01:18:37,359
他们敷衍说
which is their way of saying

826
01:18:37,432 --> 01:18:40,491
他们不知道他究竟在哪里
they have no idea where the hell he is.

827
01:18:40,575 --> 01:18:42,730
呃 他们怎么会知道呢?
Well, how could they know?

828
01:18:43,903 --> 01:18:45,482
是他们核准棺材登机的
They're the ones that checked him in.

829
01:18:45,524 --> 01:18:47,286
我是说 他们肯定有什么追踪系统
I mean, they've gotta have some kind of tracking system.

830
01:18:47,301 --> 01:18:49,069
不 我不是在说棺材
No, I'm not talking about the coffin.

831
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:52,051
我是说 他们怎么知道他在哪里?
I mean, how could they know where he is?

832
01:18:54,038 --> 01:18:58,368
他们没弄丢你爸爸 他们只是弄丢了他的遗体
They didn't lose your father. They just lost his body.

833
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:13,024
不管怎样 你比我惨
Either way, your story beats the hell out of mine.

834
01:19:13,065 --> 01:19:15,618
我包里不过是一捆刀
All that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives.

835
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:16,706
谢谢
Thanks.

836
01:19:16,738 --> 01:19:18,461
你是推销员?
You some kind of salesman?

837
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:21,081
嗯 差不多
Yeah, somethin' like that.

838
