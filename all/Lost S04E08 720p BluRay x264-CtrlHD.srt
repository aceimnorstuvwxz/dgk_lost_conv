00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,047
如果你这样做  我们就放了你和Walt
And if you do, we'll let you and walt go free.

5
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:34,095
我会做的  给我枪
I'll do it. Give me the gun.

6
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:37,001
我会杀了他的

00:00:42,028 --> 00:00:44,012
Michael?

8

你履行了你的承诺
You lived up to your word.

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,096
我们也说话算数
We live up to our word, too.

10
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,056
你坐这条船
You're gonna take this boat

11
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,043
然后沿着罗盘指向3-2-5位置
And follow a compass bearing of 3-2-5,

12
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:00,070
如果你能精确的那么做
And if you do that exactly,

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,091
你和你儿子就会得救
You and your son will find rescue.

14
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,067
你们这些人到底是谁?
Who are you people?

15
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:10,061
我们是好人  Michael
We're the good guys, Michael.

16
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:14,048
-Walt!  -Dad!
-Walt!  -dad!

17
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:17,012
快过来  快过来
Come here! come here!

18
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:08,098
谢谢你们大家的耐心等待
Thank you all for your patience.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,057
我知道我已经花了好几天时间去...
I know it's taken me a few days to...

20
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:19,040
确定我们下一步行动  不过我还不想有任何行动
Figure out our next move, but I don't want to do anything

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,051
除非我知道更多我们的情况
until I knew more about our situation.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,096
你们应该也要和我一样知道一切
You deserve to know everything that I do,

23
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:28,043
所以...我要告诉你们一切
So... no more secrets.

24
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:31,047
你们都知道
As you all know,

25
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:34,037
Miles还有他的三个人
Miles here and three of his people

26
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:37,054
大概一星期前来到岛上
Came to the island about a week ago.

27
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:39,068
所以我把他从船上绑来
So I brought him up from the boathouse

28
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:42,028
跟我们分享
To share with us

29
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,048
到底他们为什么来这儿
Exactly why they're here.

30
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,089
我们是为他而来的
We're here for him.

31
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:53,053
我们大概  几万年前就知道这个了
Um, we kind of, like, knew that forever ago.

32
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:55,046
那么好了
Well, all right then.

33
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,033
问题解决了  我们什么时候把他交出去?  
Problem solved.How soon do we turn him over?

34
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,060
我们不能
we can't turn him over.

35
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,034
-到底为什么不能?  -因为一旦他们抓到了我
-And why the hell not?  -Because once they have me,

36
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:04,084
他们的指令就是杀掉岛上的其他所有人
Their orders are to kill everyone else on the island.

37
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,058
等等  那么...他现在是我们中一员了?
Wait. so...what, he's one of us now?

38
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,076
你是要  你是要保护他?
You're--you're gonna protect him?

39
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,002
他可曾经想杀了你的啊  John
He tried to kill you, john.

40
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:19,069
对  他也不会告诉我们他在船上的间谍是谁
Yeah. He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is.

41
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,055
是Michael
It's michael.

42
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,012
什么?
What?

43
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:25,079
我在货船上的间谍是Michael
My spy on the freighter is Michael.

44
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,093
抱歉
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,003
你说的是冷血地杀了两个女人
You mean the same guy that killed two women in cold blood

46
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,087
放了那个混蛋
To set this little bastard free?

47
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:37,064
然后把我们都出卖了才离开岛上的
And then sold all of us out so he could get off the island

48
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:38,094
-那个Michael?  -是的  James
-That michael?  -Yes, james.

49
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,088
是那个Michael
That Michael.

50
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:11,027
逃亡的规则...
The rules of desertion...

51
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:14,054
仍然适用于每个人
Still apply to everyone.

52
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:19,018
没有我的话  谁也别想离开这条船
Nobody leaves this ship without my say-so!

53
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,038
我打这些人不是去吓你们
I'm not beating these men to scare you.

54
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:28,075
我打他们是为了救你们的命
I beat them to save your lives!

55
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:31,089
你还记得上次那两个
Do you remember what happened to the last two men

56
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,046
离开的人怎么了吗?
Who took off in is boat?

57
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:35,063
你还记得Minkowski怎么了吗?
You remember what happened to minkowski?

58
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:37,076
只要我们一修好引擎
As soon as we get the engines fixed,

59
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,083
我们就继续搜索
We're back in the hunt.

60
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,090
同时
In the meantime,

61
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,070
大家都不要轻举妄动
Everybody just hold on.

62
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:48,011
Johnson!
Johnson!

63
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,064
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:58,022
把这儿打扫干净
Clean this mess up.

65
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:59,065
先生
Sir.

66
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,000
你好  Michael
Hello, michael.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,063
-伙计 现在不行  -就是现在  
-Not now, man.  -Yes,right now.

68
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,054
你为什么在这船上?
Why are you on this boat?

69
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,021
我是来寻死的
I'm here to die.

70
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,053
遇见你真好  John
That was a nice meetin', John,

71
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,085
不过我想不会再有更多秘密了
But I thought there wasn't gonna be any more secrets.

72
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:01,071
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

73
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:02,098
我是说你们这些家伙要的
I'm talking about the 3 million bucks

74
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,049
300万美元
Your buddy here asked for.

75
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:12,044
Miles用他的忠诚换钱
Miles offered his loyalty in exchange for the money.

76
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,080
不过既然没看到岛上有银行
But as I haven't seen a bank on the island,

77
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,030
我觉得这个根本不值一提
I didn't think it worth mentioning.

78
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:19,025
有什么好笑的?
Somethin' funny?

79
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,097
Linus会找到办法拿到的
Linus will find a way to get it.

80
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,069
那他会怎么做?
And how will he do that?

81
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:30,046
他想存活下来
He wants to survive.

82
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:34,069
还有考虑到一星期前你拿着枪指着他的头
And considering a week ago you had a gun to his head,

83
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:36,077
而今晚他却在吃碎蛋糕
And tonight he's eating pound cake...

84
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:39,076
我得说这个家伙得到了他想要的
I'd say he's a guy who gets what he wants.

85
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,078
好的  谢谢
It's fine. Okay, thanks.

86
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,001
拜拜  大家
Bye, guys.

87
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:54,077
Alex?
Alex?

88
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,053
我能和你说句话吗?
May I have a word with you?

89
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,090
我们已经听够了你这一晚上的唠叨了
I think we've heard enough from you for one night.

90
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,091
抱歉  你们还是要再多听一会
I'm sorry. You're just gonna have to listen to a little more.

91
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:07,054
好的  你要干嘛?
It's okay. What do you want?

92
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:12,018
这是去神殿的地图
This is a map to the temple.

93
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,046
那是个圣地
It's a sanctuary.

94
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:15,087
这可能是岛上最后的安全地带了
It may be the last safe place on this island.

95
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,058
我们怎么不知道这个?
How can we don't know about this?

96
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,099
如果我告诉大家  那个地方就不是圣地了  对吗?
Well, it wouldn't be a sanctuary if I told everyone, would it?

97
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,017
我们剩余的人已经都在那儿了
The rest of our people are already there.

98
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:25,026
如果你们现在出发  一天半就可以到那儿
If you leave now, you can get there in a day and a half.

99
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,088
如果那儿很安全  为什么我们不都去  
If it's safe, why don't we all go--Hurley,

100
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,031
Hurley  Claire  婴儿?
Claire, the baby?

101
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:31,039
因为神殿 不是给他们的  Karl  只是给我们的
Because the temple's Not for them, Karl. It's only for us.

102
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,075
这些正在赶来的人  他们知道我是谁  Alex
These people that are coming-- they know who I am, Alex.

103
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:37,075
我们会杀了任何妨碍他们的人
They'll kill anybody that get in their way.

104
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,093
如果他们知道了你是谁  知道了你是我女儿
If they knew who you were, that you were my daughter,

105
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:43,052
他们就会利用你来抓我
They would use you to get to me.

106
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:45,080
我们没多少时间了
We don't have much time.

107
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:49,061
也许他是对的
Maybe he's right.

108
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,085
我同意 我们应该走
I agree. We should go.

109
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:03,041
这些人  你说他们很危险
These people-- you said they're dangerous.

110
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:05,073
比你更危险?
More dangerous than you?

111
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:11,049
是的
Yes.

112
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,076
不过你母亲会保护你的
But your mother will protect you.

113
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:22,061
好了  走吧
Okay, now go.

114
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,027
他在哪?
Where is he?

115
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:42,035
-你确定?  -是的
-You sure? -Yeah.

116
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,071
他在动力室
He's in the engine room.

117
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:56,050
我不知道  这个应该会有用的
I don'understand it. It should be working.

118
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:59,002
垫圈都被腐蚀了
Gaskets are all corroded.

119
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,041
我能帮你吗?
Can I help you?

120
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,059
船长派我们下来帮忙修理
The captain sent us down to help with the repairs

121
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,008
谢谢  我们能行
Oh, thanks. We're okay.

122
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,038
Jeff  你知道吗?
Hey, Jeff, man, you know what?

123
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:17,035
我们需要个压力阀  你介意去补给室
We need a pressure valve. you mind grabbing one

124
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:20,002
去一个来吗?  -不介意
-From the, uh, supply room?  -Not at all.

125
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,069
你不应该在这儿
You shouldn't be here.

126
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:29,084
-Sayid  你在做什么?  -你为什么在这?  
-Oh, Sayid, what are you doing? -Why are you here?

127
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,003
-如果他们看到我和你说话  -那就快说
-If they see me talking to you-- -Then talk quickly.

128
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,093
-你根本不会明白的!  -我会完全明白的  Michael
You won't understand it! I'll understand perfectly, Michael.

129
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,001
你从头开始
You just start from the beginning

130
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,028
解释下你是怎么来到这船上的
And explain how you came to be on this boat.

131
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,011
对不起  Dawson先生  我本不想吵醒你
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you, mr. dawson.

132
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,067
你是?
It's...

133
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:38,072
我怎么了?
What happened to me?

134
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:41,071
你出车祸了  你能活下来真是个奇迹
You were in a car accident. it's a miracle you're alive.

135
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,030
我伤得有多重？
How badly am I hurt?

136
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:46,079
你现在需要休息
Shh. you just need to rest now.

137
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,075
晚上很凉
It's a cold night.

138
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,070
我帮你加一床毯子
I brought you some extra blankets.

139
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:05,045
让我们开灯看看
Ugh. let's get some light in here.

140
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,021
我好像听到有人在叫
Now I thought I heard someone shout,

141
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,005
很明显不是他
and something tells me it wasn't him.

142
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,088
你还好吗
You okay?

143
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,063
你能活着真是运气太好了
You're lucky to be alive.

144
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:19,043
急救队在一个撞得变形的车里找到了你
E.m.t.s say they found you in a wrecked car

145
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:21,037
有张纸条别在你的胸前
There's a note pinnedo your chest.

146
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,007
你身上没有身份证
You didn't have any i.d. on you.

147
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,039
能告诉我你叫什么吗？
you Want to tell me your name?

148
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:31,089
好吧 看来你不想
Yeah, I didn't think so.

149
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,002
你需要我们通知Walt吗
You want me to call walt?

150
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:39,097
你说什么?
What?

151
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:41,067
粘在你胸前的纸条
The note pinned to your chest.

152
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:44,068
上写着Walt  要我们通知他吗
It was written to "walt." you want me to call him?

153
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,060
不
No.

154
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,066
那好吧
Okay, then.

155
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,029
嗨  妈
Hey, ma.

156
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,038
我能进去...坐坐吗
Can i... come in?

157
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,079
不能  你知道的
No. you know the answer to that.

158
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:30,020
-我想要看看他  -不行
I wanna see him. no.

159
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:32,084
-让我解释一下  -我不想让你跟那个孩子谈什么
Just let me talk-- I don't know what you said to that boy,

160
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:36,007
不管怎样  他不想见你
But whatever it was, he doesn't want to see you.

161
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:39,034
拜托了  妈  他是我的儿子  我有个那个权利
Please, ma. he's my son. I have a right

162
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,070
他以为你已经死了
He thought you were dead.

163
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,033
他们说你坐的飞机在大海中坠毁了
They said your plane crashed in the middle of the ocean,

164
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:48,015
但你又出现了  毫发无损  
But you show up here fine and dandy,

165
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:51,098
只有你和Walt才知道怎么和别人说
Only I can't tell anybody but you or walt,

166
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,012
我不能叫你的真名
I can't call you by your real names.

167
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:56,039
他几乎不和我说话
He barely talks to me,

168
00:14:56,076 --> 00:15:00,043
但他却在半夜被噩梦惊醒
But he does wake up screamin' in the middle of the night,

169
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,083
只有我对他说
And I'm the one who got to tell him

170
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,042
宝贝  没事的
It's gonna be okay.

171
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,008
你得给我解释清楚
So until you can explain to me

172
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:13,081
这两个月你去哪儿了?
Where you were for over two months

173
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,035
发生了什么事了?
And what happened...

174
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,015
你已经放弃了你的权利
You gave up your rights.

175
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,018
你能不能
Will you, uh...

176
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:35,013
告诉他  我爱他
Will you tell him I love him?

177
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,062
可以
Yeah.

178
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,019
有什么可以帮你的吗
What can I do for ya?

179
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,096
这个值多少钱
How much can I get for that?

180
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,045
为什么上面有中文
Why is there chinese writing all over it?

181
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,099
是韩文  一个韩国人给我的
It's korean,an-- the guy who gave it to me.

182
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:40,040
你看起来不会说韩语
You don't look like you speak korean.

183
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,057
-我给你300美元  -我不是要钱
I'll give you $300 for it. I'm not looking for money.

184
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:47,099
那你要什么
What are you looking for?

185
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:50,090
我要一把枪和一些子弹
I want a gun. I want a gun with bullets.

186
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,097
好吧  该结束了
Come on. let's just get this done.

187
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:22,017
帮我结束它吧
Help me just get this done.

188
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:30,061
打扰了  先生  你有时间吗
Excuse me, sir. you got the time?

189
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,021
不  没有
No, man. no.

190
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:34,084
好了  Michael
Come on, michael.

191
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:40,043
帮帮老朋友吧
How about for an old friend?

192
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:54,065
你来曼哈顿了啊?
Manhattan, huh?

193
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,038
我们让你离开了那个岛  
We let you leave one island,

194
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,043
结果你又到了这个岛（曼哈顿）
 you just go to another one.

195
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:03,095
你能不能放松点  我只是来...
Will you just relax? I just came here to

196
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:09,083
现在能像个成年人一样和我谈话了吗？
Now are u ready to talk like adults?

197
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:11,072
是的
Yeah.

198
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,041
够了
Enough!

199
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,000
开枪吧  开吧  开啊
Do it. go ahead, do it!

200
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:25,069
你想死  是吧
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

201
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,097
你怎么找到我的?
How do you find me?

202
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,019
Michael  是我们让你回家的  
We are the ones who sent you home, michael.

203
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:34,028
你真的天真得以为我们会放过你？
Did you honestly think we weren't gonna keep tabs?

204
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:36,020
你到底想要什么?
What do you want?

205
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,067
你的帮忙
Your help.

206
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,001
我为什么要帮一个
Why would I help the son of a bitch

207
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:42,020
绑架了我儿子的杂种?
Who kidnapped my son?

208
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,027
Mike  我们毫发无损地把他还给你了  
We gave him back to you in one piece, mike.

209
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:45,090
是你把他丢了
You're the one who lost him.

210
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,061
你告诉他了  是不是？
You told him, didn't you?

211
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:58,099
想想你自己对那些女人都做了什么
You couldn't carry the guilt

212
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,064
你自己承担不了那份内疚
Of what you did to those two women all by yourself,

213
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:02,084
所以你要一个10岁大的孩子帮你分担
So you shared it with a 10-year-old kid.

214
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:07,074
这是不是你要自杀的原因  Michael？
Is that why you wanna kill yourself, micel?

215
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,014
因为他是那样认为你的
Because that's the way he looks at you now?

216
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,055
-因为他知道你是个杀人犯  -滚！  
Because he knows you're a murderer? go away!

217
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:13,093
我有些坏消息要告诉你  Amigo
I got some bad news for you, amigo.

218
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:16,046
你不能自杀  那个岛也不会让你这么干的
You can't kill yourself. the island won't let you!

219
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,032
你说什么
What'd you say?

220
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:23,014
不管你有多么想自杀
No matter how bad you want to,

221
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:26,013
不管你要尝试多少种方法
No matter how many different ways you try,

222
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,019
你是不会成功的
It won happen.

223
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,088
如果你不相信我  你可以开枪试试
Give it a shot if you don't belie me.

224
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:38,076
你有更重要的事要做  Mike
You got more work to do, mike.

225
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,030
如果你想通了
When you figure that out,

226
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,003
到Earle酒店的顶楼来找我
I'm in the penthouse at the hotel earle.

227
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,075
大洋航空815航班的残骸
The wreckage of oceanic flight 815

228
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,062
已经找到
Has them found.

229
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:32,036
这组连续镜头确定了
This footage confirms

230
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:34,068
飞机的确失事并沉入海底
The airplane did, in fact, crash at sea.

231
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:37,072
在这么深的海洋中
At these tremendous depths,

232
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:40,008
找到幸存者的希望几乎为零
There is little hope of recovering any remains.

233
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:42,054
调查人员也在怀疑
Investigators are equally skeptical

234
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,071
是否能找到大洋航空815航班的
About the chances of retrieving

235
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,017
黑匣子
Oceanic 815's black box.

236
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,016
这架不幸的飞机
The real story behind

237
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,019
到底发生了什么  其真相
What happened to this fateful airliner

238
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,019
也许就会像机上324名乘客一样  再也找不回来
May have been lost along with the 324 passengers onboard.

239
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,003
但是即使是这个悲惨的发现
But even with this tragic discovery,

240
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,025
遇难者家属今天仍希望...
The victims' families were hoping today...

241
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:06,065
我没想到你会这么快
I didn't expect you that fast.

242
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,030
这就是拿香槟瓶砸你头的家伙
Is this the guy who hit you with the champagne bottle?

243
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:18,062
没错  不过我马上就要报这个仇了
Yeah, but I had it coming.

244
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:23,071
Arturo  我要和Michael谈点事
Arturo, michael and I have some business to attend to.

245
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:26,077
-你出去透透气吧?  -行
Would you get some air? of course.

246
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:28,048
再见
Ciao.

247
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,030
要不要吃点
Help yourself to the chow.

248
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:36,054
这东西在国内可不常吃...
Don't make it to the mainland too often...

249
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:39,025
所以要是一有机会  我就会狂吃一顿
So when I do, I like to indulge myself.

250
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:42,090
你们的人都能来去自如?
So you people can just... come and go?

251
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:45,000
一部分人吧  要喝点什么吗?
Some of us. you want a drink?

252
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:46,029
我要你告诉我
What I want is for you to tell me

253
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,021
那飞机在海底怎么了
What my plane is doing at the bottom of the ocean.

254
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,036
没有所谓的飞机  那是个幌子
That's not your plane. it's a phony.

255
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:57,089
有个叫Widmore人把那玩意沉下去的
A man named Widmore put it down there,

256
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,058
伪造所有的残骸
And he staged the whole wreck.

257
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:02,030
伪造?  他为什么伪造
Staged? why would he stage a--

258
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:04,003
因为不想让人知道
Because he doesn't want anyone else finding

259
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:07,001
真正的飞机是在哪失事  除了他自己
Where the real plane ended up... except for him.

260
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,046
你以为我会相信吗?
I'm supposed to believe this?

261
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,094
子弹被你的头盖骨反弹出来了?
Did the bullet bounce off your skull,

262
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:19,058
还是那枪卡了?
Or did the gun just jam on you?

263
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,005
证明一下
Prove it.

264
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:27,066
什么?
Sorry?

265
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:30,021
证明Widmore这家伙  真是如你所言
Prove that this guy, Widmore, did what you say he did.

266
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,002
证明给我啊
Prove it.

267
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:45,065
那是泰国的公墓
That's the cemetery in Thailand

268
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:49,038
Widmore从那里挖了300具尸体
Where Widmore dug up the 300-odd corpses he needed.

269
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,078
这是他从一家空壳公司
And the purchase order for the old 777

270
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,078
买了份老的777飞机的定单
Bought through a shell company,

271
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,007
和货船的航海日志
And the shipping logs for the freighter he used

272
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:59,002
使得事情变得更加扑朔迷离
To drop the whole mess down a trench deep enough

273
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,057
为了确保每个残骸都无法被识别出来
To guarantee that no remains are ever gonna be identified.

274
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:04,013
你能想象  为了运来这些尸体
Do you have any idea what it would cost

275
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:05,095
我们付出怎样的代价吗?
To bring those bodies up?

276
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:09,058
你要我怎么做?
What you want from me, man?

277
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,021
几天后
In a few days,

278
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:15,075
会有艘货船在斐济停靠
A freighter is porting in fiji.

279
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,043
是Widmore的船
It's widmore's boat.

280
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:19,068
我们有理由相信他终于在岛上
We have reason to believe he's finally found

281
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:22,096
找到同党了  他正要向那里去
The coordinates of the island, and he's heading right for it.

282
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:27,007
那么恭喜你  Michael  你的星际旅行到此为止了
So congratulations, michael. your shore leave is over.

283
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:28,097
你待在那船上只要做一件事就行

去找Kevin Johnson

286

你要我去卧底?
You want me to go unrcover?

287
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:46,007
我到底凭什么回那去替你们卖命?
Why the hell would I go back to work for you people?

288
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:48,052
因为如果Widmore找到了这个岛
Because if widmore finds the island,

289
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,094
那岛上的人都得死
It's good night for everybody on it.

290
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,011
他眼都不眨就会把所有的人杀光殆尽
He'll kill them all without thinking twice.

291
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:56,096
你要想挽回你的过失?
You wanna redeem yourself for what you did?

292
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:58,069
这是你唯一的机会

293
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:00,065
你能救他们所有人的命

295
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:06,090
我又没叫你回岛上去
I didn't say you were going back to the island.

296
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:11,053
只叫你上那艘船  你可以擦擦甲板  Michael
You're going on that boat so you can swab decks, michael.

297
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:16,052
这样你就有机会把船上的统统干掉
You're going so you can kill everyone onboard.

298

And, uh, turn this knob on the console. got it.

411
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,076
知道了
Okay.

412
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,016
Walt?
Walt?

413
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:01,057
抱歉  Michael  他还在纽约
I'm so sorry, Michael, but he's still in new york.

414
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:06,034
恐怕你只能和我混了
So I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

415
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,081
Michael
Michael?

416
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:14,045
还在听吗
Are you still there?

417
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:18,044
你把我骗到这船上
You put me on this boat,

418
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:21,094
叫我把这船炸掉
Talked me into blowing it up,

419
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:24,050
当我按下该死的按钮
And when I push the damn button,

420
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:27,004
却出现了一张纸条
A flag pops up.

421
00:36:28,004 --> 00:36:30,003
你真的激活了炸弹吗
You actually activated the bomb?

422
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:31,050
根本就不是什么炸弹!  是个...
It's not a bomb! it's a...

423
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:34,006
只是个玩笑
It's a joke.

424
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:38,001
船上有些人是无辜的
There are people on your boat who are innocent.

425
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,041
他们毫不知情
They have no idea

426
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:41,065
不知道他们的雇主是个恶魔
That the man they work for is a monster,

427
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:45,046
没有良知的杀人犯不会有更大的作为
A killer without conscience wouldn't get a greater purpose.

428
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:48,096
我得让你知道我和他是不一样
I had to show you the difference between him and me.

429
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,064
在战争时期  我会不折手段去赢得胜利
When I'm at war, I'll do what I need to do to win,

430
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:55,001
但是我不会杀死无辜百姓
But I will not kill innocent people.

431
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:57,041
Ana Lucia和Libby...
Ana Lucia and Libby...

432
00:36:57,086 --> 00:36:59,031
她们也是无辜的啊
They were innocent.

433
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,035
是你杀死了他们  Michael
You killed them, Michael.

434
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:04,026
没人叫你这么干
No one asked you to.

435
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,038
我这不是在怪你  Michael
I don't blame you, Michael.

436
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,017
你儿子确实在我们手上
We did you have your boy.

437
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:14,035
一个男人为他儿子有什么不会做的呢?
And what wouldn'a man do for his son?

438
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,048
你想要我...做什么?
What do you want... from me?

439
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:24,015
我要你给我一份名单
I want you to compile a list of names...

440
00:37:25,006 --> 00:37:27,029
要船上所有人的名字
Every person on your boat.

441
00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:30,079
当我再次打电话来  你就得告诉我
When I call again, you'll give me that list.

442
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,088
然后你就废了
Then you will disable

443
00:37:31,089 --> 00:37:34,011
你所在通讯室
The radio room you're sitting in.

444
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:37,069
当他们因无法通讯而迷航时
When the crew is disiented by their lack of communication,

445
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,079
你就把出发动机也卸了
You'll take out the engines, too.

446
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:43,089
这样  这船就永远都到不了这个岛
That way, the boat can never get to this island,

447
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,073
你的朋友也会安然无恙
And your friends will be safe.

448
00:37:52,024 --> 00:37:54,060
你能做到吗  Michael
Will you do that for me, Michael?

449
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:03,036
能
Yeah.

450
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,039
那么你就继续装作和他们一伙的吧
Then consider yourself one of the good guys.

451
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:38,036
你是说...
So you're telling me...

452
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:42,086
你在为Benjamin Linus卖命
That you're working for Benjamin Linus?

453
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:50,081
是的
Yeah.

454
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,033
是的  我就是这意思
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

455
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,046
放手
Hold it! uhh!

456
00:39:08,064 --> 00:39:10,021
放开我  你要嘛?
Let me go! what are you doing?!

457
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,030
闭嘴!
Shut your mouth

458
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:16,049
这是怎么回事?
What the hell is this?

459
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,046
这人不是你想象的那样简单
This man is not who you think he is.

460
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:22,033
他是大洋815航班的乘客
He was a passenger onceanic flight 8-1-5.

461
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:24,074
在出卖我们之前
I spent two months with him on the island

462
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:26,060
我们一起在岛上呆了两个月
Before he betrayed us.

463
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,002
就是他捣毁了你们的通讯室
This is the man who sabotaged your radio room.

464
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:31,011
他把船的发动机也毁了
He destroyed the ship's engine,

465
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:33,066
他也不叫Ken Johnson
And his name isn't Ken Johnson.

466
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:37,008
他是Michael Dawson
It's michael dawson,

467
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:39,099
他是叛徒
And he's a traitor.

468
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:01,004
停下来喝点水吧
Stop here and drink.

469
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,054
两分钟后我们继续赶路
Two minutes, then we keep moving.

470
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:24,046
怎么了?
What's wrong?

471
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:26,086
没什么
Nothing.

472
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:28,063
Karl
Karl.

473
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:30,082
我也不清楚
I don't know.

474
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:34,054
只是有种不详的预感
I just he a bad feeling about this.

475
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:38,035
要是你父亲...在玩弄我们怎么办?
What if your dad is... playing us?

476
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:42,034
听着  我不想接受他的命令
Look, I don't like taking orders from my dad

477
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:43,084
比你还不想
Any more than you do.

478
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,002
但我知道他不会让我受到伤害的
But I know he doesn' want me to get hurt.

479
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:50,088
好吧  至少我们又有共同点了
Well, at least we've got something in common.

480
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:54,088
你得保证不要和别人说  
Promise not to tell if you won't.

481
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:07,053
-Alex!   -Karl!

482
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,083
-Karl  Karl  不要  -快点

No. he gone! listen to me. I need you to take my hand.

488
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:28,063
我数一二三  我们就跑
On the count of three, we're going to run.

489
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:32,035
你能做到吗?
Can you do that with me?

490
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,041
我爱你
I love you.

我非常爱你  Alexana
