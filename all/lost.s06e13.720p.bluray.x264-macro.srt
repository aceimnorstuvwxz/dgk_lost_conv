00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,860
"迷失" 前情提要...
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,010
臭丫头
Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,110

把枪放下!

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,680

我怀孕了...

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,750
我们马上送你去医院 Locke先生?
We're gonna get you to the hospital. Mr. Locke?

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,300
Locke先生?
Mr. Locke?

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,240
你弄清楚 他们藏在潜水艇上的东西了?
You found what they were hiding in the submarine?

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,070
一清二楚
I most certainly did.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,420
啊!
Aah!

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,120
- 你好 Hugo  - 我们得跟你谈谈
- Hello, Hugo.  - We have to talk to you.

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,230
"我们"?
"We"?

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,760
好了 伙计们
Okay, guys.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,550
出来吧
Come on out.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,790
你好 Jack
Hello, Jack.

15
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,020
我正等着你呢
I was hoping you'd come.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,080
我想 我们得好好叙叙旧呢
I think we have some catching up to do.

17
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,500
Hurley啊...
Hurley...

18
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,340
来见他是你的主意
This was your idea.

19
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,390
我跟他谈谈 没事吧?
You all right with me talking with him alone?

20
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,710
自己当心 伙计
It's all you, dude.

21
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,200
走吧 去谈吧
All right, let's catch up.

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,100
你这模样真像他
You look just like him.

23
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,160
没给你造成困扰吧?
Does it bother you?

24
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,310
不 让我困扰的是
No, what bothers me is

25
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,840
- 我根本不晓得你是什么东西  - 这倒是
- I don't have any idea what the hell you are.  - Sure you do.

26
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,420
为什么挑John Locke?
Why John Locke?

27
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,030
因为他笨得相信
Because he was stupid enough to believe

28
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,180
自己是基于某个理由 而到这儿来的
that he'd been brought here for a reason,

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,460
因为他对此始终坚信不疑 直到因此身亡
because he pursued that belief until it got him killed,

30
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,990
还因为你的善良
and because you were kind enough

31
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,890
用一具精致木棺 将他的遗体运载来此
to bring his body back here in a nice wooden box.

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,760
还因为你要扮成他 所以他必须得死吧
He had to be dead before you could look like him.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,270
没错
That's right.

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,820
你还想扮成谁?
Who else have you looked like?

35
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,350
Jack 你到底想问我什么?
Jack, what do you really want to ask me?

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
我们到这儿来的第三天 我看见...
The third day we were here, I saw...

37
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,790
我在林间追逐我爸...
I chased my father through the jungle...

38
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,910
我... 已故的父亲
My... my dead father.

39
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,600
他也是你扮成的?
Was that you?

40
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,420
没错 是我
Yes, that was me.

41
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,570
为什么?
Why?

42
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,730
你需要找到水源
You needed to find water.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,490
可能说出来你不信 Jack
This may be hard for you to believe, Jack,

44
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,030
但我所做的一切都是为了帮你
but all I've ever been interested in is helping you.

45
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,650
帮我?
Help me?

46
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,400
干嘛?
To do what?

47
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,330
离开这里
Leave.

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,630
因为Jacob选了你
But because Jacob chose you,

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,820
所以在你没来之前 你就已经注定要受困此岛
you were trapped on this island before you even got here.

50
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,110
但现在 Jacob死了
But now Jacob's dead.

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,900
我们再也不用被困在这儿了
We don't have to be trapped anymore.

52
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,960
我们可以登上飞机 想走就走
We can get on an airplane and fly away anytime we want to.

53
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,480
如果我们真的想走就能走
And if we can just fly away whenever we want,

54
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,270
那你为何还在这里?
why are you still here?

55
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,920
因为我得找齐所有人
Because it has to be all of us.

56
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,920
怎么了?
What?

57
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,560
我们当中 John Locke是唯一一个
John Locke was the only one of us

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
对该地抱有信仰的人
that ever believed in this place.

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,870
他竭尽全力
He did everything he could

60
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,590
阻止我们离岛
to keep us from leaving this island.

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,970
John Locke可不是个信徒 Jack
John Locke was not a believer, Jack.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,750
他不过是个傻瓜
He was a sucker.

63
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,890
心率过速 当前值为130 血压持续降低
Sinus tach at 130, B.P. dropping.

64

但他有轮椅的 轮椅哪儿去了?
But he uses a wheelchair. Where is it?

71
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,010
早变成碎片了 搞不好是轮椅救了他一命
Smashed to pieces, that thing probably saved his life.

72
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,660
我看到了肇事者 就是那个逃逸司机

- But do you know anyone we can contact for him?  - I have no idea. Like I said, I barely know him.

75
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,800

76

你照样可以娶她啊

是他!

93
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,211

94
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:55,921
出来吧
You can come out.

95
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,411
你一直在跟踪我们 Claire?
You following us, Claire?

96
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:07,481

为什么?
Why?

98
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,491
因为他是我哥哥

99
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,261
看来 你们有很多话要说啊
Looks like you two have a lot of catching up to do.

我不打扰你们了
I'll leave you to it.

101
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:30,531
Claire 对... 对不起...
Claire, I'm... I'm so sorry th...

102
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,281
他告诉你了吗?
Did he tell you?

103
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:35,341
他就是那个假装我们父亲的人?
That he was the one pretending to be our father?

104
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:37,921
是的
Yeah.

105
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,761
是的 他告诉我了
Yeah, he told me.

106
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
我几乎已经不指望
You know, I pretty much gave up hoping

107
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,510
你会回来了
that you'd ever come back.

108
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,300
既然你来了...

111
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,580
我... 我从来没有感受过家庭的温存
You know, I... I never really had much in the way of family,

112
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,970
所以... 你能和我们在一起 这意义非同一般
So it... really means a lot that you're coming with us.

113
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,720
其实 我还... 拿不定主意 要不要和你们在一起
Actually, I haven't... I haven't decided if I'm coming with you.

114
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,480
不 你已经决定了
Yeah, you have.

115
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,910
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

116
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,030
你让他和你说话的时候 就已经决定好了
You decided the moment you let him talk to you,

117
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,720
就和我们一样
Just like the rest of us.

118
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,110
就这么回事
So, yeah,

119
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,740
无论你喜不喜欢
Whether you like it or not,

120
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,180
你现在都和他在一起了
you're with him now.

迷失 第6季第13集

122
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,210
他有一艘潜艇?
He's got a submarine?

123
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,980
小声点 该死的

Kate正在和她说
Kate's telling her now.

127
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,780
我觉得我们要避免乱成一团
I thought we might want to avoid huddles.

128
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,550
那Sayid呢?
What about Sayid?

129
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,540
没算上Sayid 他变坏了
Sayid ain't invited. He's gone over to the dark side.

130
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,380
没错 但你总能让别人弃恶从善
Yeah, but you can always bring people back from the dark side.

131
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,870
- 我是说 Anakin...  - Anakin是谁?

听着 闭上你的嘴 对其他人要只字不提
Look, just keep your mouth shut. Don't say nothin' to no one.

133
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,940

It's so nice to have everyone back together again.

138
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,060
想吃苹果吗?
Want an apple?

139
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,270
嘿 Schaub 是我带她来这儿的
Hey, Schaub, I'm the one who brought her in.

140

我觉得你放了我 是因为你去过澳大利亚
I think you let me go because you went to Australia,

and you didn't want anyone to know you were there.

171

- 结果进了医院  - 哦 不 抱歉一问 你...

Excuse me if this sounds a bit personal, but, um,

228
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,390
我无意间发现
I couldn't help noticing

229
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,420
你要去收养局... 而且独自一人去
you're going to an adoption agency... alone.

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,740

But, uh, it just so happens that I'm on my way to see one.

235

你知道 收养合同很麻烦
You know, adoption contracts are complicated.

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,720
你该留神点儿
And you should be careful

237
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,790
因为你可能会陷入麻烦
because you could find yourself in a situation

238
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,660
而且永无宁日
that's irreversible.

239
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,810
问题是 我... 我没钱请律师
Yeah, I... I don't have money for a lawyer.

嗯 还有 她欠我一个人情
Uh, you know, plus, she owes me a favor.

244
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,350
所以...
So...

245
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,070
你为什么不去见见她呢?
Why don't you just come and meet her?

246
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,040
况且 我觉得她能给你实际帮助

People are trying to kill us again.

277
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,130
这事出乎我意料之外
All this is happening a bit sooner than I'd expected,

278
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,140
这些人胁迫我们
but these people have forced our hand,

279
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,380
口口声声说 我们偷了他们的东西
claiming we stole something from them,

280
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,870
想要挑事
trying to provoke us into a confrontation.

281
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,960
如果他们想打 那我们就打
Well, if that's what they want, that's what they'll get.

282
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,600
拿上你们的东西
Gather your things.

283
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,240
我们要到另一个岛去 然后登上那架飞机
We're going to the other island and we're getting on that plane.

284
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,420
James 我需要你帮我点忙
James, I need your help with something.

285
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,850
有艘船停在
There's a boat moored

286
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,870
离这数小时路程外的海岸边
just a few hours down the shore from here.

287
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,950
我要你去弄来 然后跟我们
I want you to get it and meet the rest of us

288
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,460
在断崖的另一头会合
on the other side of these bluffs.

289
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,850
我们大家一起划船去另一个岛
We'll all sail over to the other island together.

290
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,060
- 你能办到吗 James?  - 为什么我们不一起去弄船?
- Can you do that, James?  - How come we're not all heading for it together?

291
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,010
人越多 办起事来越麻烦
The bigger the group, the slower it moves.

292
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,700
- 好吧 我需要个帮手  - 随你挑
- All right. I could use another pair of hands.  - Take whoever you want.

293
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,850
怎么样 雀斑女? 你知道怎么划桨吗?
How about it, Freckles? Know anything about sailing?

294
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,520
知道
I know enough.

295
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,030
好的 我们等着你们 Sayid 你有空吗?
Good. We'll be waitin' for ya. Sayid, you got a minute?

296
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,740
能帮我个忙吗?
Can you give me a hand with somethin'?

297
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,170
听着 我只说一遍
Listen up, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

298
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,900
我们不到集合地点去接Locke
We're not going to that rendezvous point

299
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,480
我和Widmore做了个交易
to pick up Locke. I got a deal with Widmore.

300
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,900
是什么交易?
What kind of deal?

301
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,050
听我说 只要一有机会
Just listen. First chance you get,

302
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,380
你就折回来 到这个地点
You double back, hoof it to this spot.

303
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,840
这儿有一个废弃的码头
There's an old dock.

304
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,490
拽上Hugo Sun 和Lapidus Kate和我会在那儿跟你们会合
Grab Hugo, Sun and Lapidus. Kate and I will meet you there.

305
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,450
那Sayid和Claire呢?
What about Sayid and Claire?

306
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,230
Sayid就是个傀儡 Claire疯疯癫癫的
Sayid's a zombie and Claire's nuts.

307
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,380
从她想杀Kate的那一刻起 飞机上就没她的位置了
She gave up her ticket when she tried to kill kate,

308
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,690
而且我不会再让她有机会对Kate下手了
and I ain't gonna let that happen again.

309
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,370
叫上Hugo Sun 和那个飞行员 只有这些人 明白吗?
That's Hugo, Sun and the pilot. Only them. Understand?

310
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,090
但是我怎么带大家从... 从Locke的眼皮底下离开?
But how am I supposed to get us away from... from Locke?

311
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,860
你自己想办法
You figure it out.

312
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,700
准备开路了吗?
Ready to roll?

313
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,170
- 刚才那是怎么回事?  - 男人间的对话
- What was that all about?  - Guy talk.

314
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,090
我要你去我处理Desmond的地方
I need you to go out to where I've got Desmond.

315
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,690
我以为你不打算让他活着回来了
I thought you weren't going to give him back.

316
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,210
我的确有这打算
I'm not.

317
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,720
我要你去杀了他
You're gonna kill him.

318
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,270
这不会有什么问题的 对吧 Sayid?
And that's not gonna be a problem, is it, Sayid?

319
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,550
你仍想要我做成那件答应你的事 对吗?
You do still want what you asked me for, right?

320
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,300
是的 我想
Yes, I do.

321
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,070
那就按我说的做
Then go do what I said.

322
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,070
如果你要冷血地把我干掉 兄弟...
If you're gonna shoot me in cold blood, brother...

323
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,100
我觉得我有权知道
I think I have a right to know

324
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,970
你能得到什么
what you're gettin' in exchange for it.

325
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,460
他告诉我 我可以找回我失去的一些东西
He told me I could get something back I lost.

326
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,320
那你失去了什么?
And what did you lose?

327
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,540
我爱的女人
The woman I loved.

328
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,390
她现在在哪儿?
And where is she now?

329
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,910
她死了
Dead.

330
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,860
你凭什么觉得Locke可以把她带回来?
And what makes you think Locke can bring her back?

331
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,500
我死过一次...
I died...

332
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,680
他把我救活了
And he brought me back.

333
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,420
那你怎么对她说?
So what will you tell her?

334
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,680
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

335
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,990
这个女人...
This woman...

336
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,520
当她问你 你是怎么才和她重聚的...
when she asks you what you did to be with her again...

337
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,240
你怎么对她说?
what will you tell her?

338
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,887
Sayid啊
Sayid.

339
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:42,207
出什么事儿了?
What's going on?

340
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:44,357
现在你一身轻松了
Everything will be okay for you now.

341
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,987
我处理好了
I took care of it.

342
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,897
你什么意思? 你去哪儿?
What do you mean? Where are you going?

343
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:51,347
我得走了
I have to leave.

344
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:53,967
你伤人了吗?
Did you hurt someone?

345
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:57,157
Nadia 我要走了
Nadia, I'm leaving,

346
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,907
我永远也不能再回来了
and I'm never going to be able to come back again.

347
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,590
你干了什么 Sayid?
What did you do, Sayid?

348
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,280
拖住他们
Stall them.

349
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,870
是谁?
Who is it?

350
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,170
洛杉矶警察局
L.A.P.D.

351
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,300
我能看看证件吗?
May I see some identification?

352
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,710
请你把门打开 可以吗?
Can you open the door, please?

353
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,140
Jarrah夫人 我是Straume探员
Mrs. Jarrah, I'm detective Straume.

354
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,000
我要问你几个问题
I need to ask you some questions.

355
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,420
你有时间吗?
You have a few minutes?

356
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,980
好的 趴下
That's good. Stay down.

357
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,460

358

你被捕了
You're under arrest.

359
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,880
船被吹到那儿了
There she blows.

360
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,460
准备好沾水了吗?
You ready to get wet?

361
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,490
哦
Oh.

362
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,400
你确定这是个好主意吗?
You sure this is a good idea?

363
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,800
你看见桥了吗?
You see a bridge?

364
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,920
- 回去接Locke  - 当然不是
- Going back to get Locke.  - Of course not.

365
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,880
这是个烂点子 所以我们不会那么做
It's a terrible idea, which is why we ain't doing it.

366
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,290
什么?
What?

367
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,960
我们要甩下Locke
We're gonna ditch Locke.

368
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,900
你 我 Jack Hurley Sun 还有那个长得像
You, me, Jack, Hurley, Sun and that pilot that looks like

369
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,440
Burt Reynolds电影里某角色的飞行员
he's stepped off the set of a Burt Reynolds' movie.

370
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,760
你当初打算瞒我到什么时候?
When were you planning on telling me this?

371
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,860
就现在
Now.

372
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,190
等等 你没说Claire
Wait. You didn't say Claire.

373
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,710
因为没算上她
'Cause she ain't comin'.

374
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,830
你回岛上想找的那个Claire 已经不在了
The Claire you came back for is gone.

375
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,020
我保证过 要把她带回去
I promised I would bring her back.

376
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,480
那是在Claire投靠Locke之前
That was before she started drinkin' Locke's Kool-Aid.

377
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,770
她很危险 你真的想让她待在Aaron身边吗?
She's dangerous. You really want her around Aaron?

378
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,220
我们走 时间不多了
Let's go. We ain't got much time.

379
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,960

380
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,530
嗨 Jack
Jack.

381
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,260
你跟着Locke多久了?
How long have you been with Locke?

382
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,830
从你们离开的时候起
Ever since you left.

383
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,200
那么你信任他?
So you trust him?

384
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,770
对
Yeah.

385
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,340
为什么?
Why?

386
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,690
因为他是唯一一个没有抛弃我的人
'Cause he's the only one that didn't abandon me.

387
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,850
Sun 你看见Sayid了吗?
Sun, have you seen Sayid?

388
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,690
在半英里前的地方 他就应该追上咱们了
He was supposed to catch up with us about a half a mile back.

389
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,350
哦 沉默不语?
Oh, the silent treatment?

390
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,850

都是你害的!

391
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,160
对不起 Sun 但是我什么也没做
I'm sorry, Sun, but I didn't do anything to you.

392
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,790
James现在应该在路上
James should be on his way by now.

393
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,810
让大家继续向海滩的方向走
Just keep everyone moving to the beach.

394
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,740
- 一会儿我会追上你们的  - 你去哪儿?
- I'll catch up with you there.  - Where are you going?

395
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,590
我要确保没人落下
I wanna make sure nobody got left behind.

396
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,680
- Hurley 等一下  - 怎么了?
- Hurley, wait up.  - Yeah?

397
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,900
Sun啊
Sun.

398
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,740
我们现在就得走
We have to go now.

399
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,500
去哪儿?
Go where?

400
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,630
没时间解释了 我们得走了 跟我来
There's no time. We just gotta go. Follow me.

401
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,390
嗯 我觉得我们应该按照Sawyer的计划行事
Um, I think we should stick to Sawyer's plan,

402
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,420
- 要不他会很生气  - 这就是Sawyer的计划 我们走
- or he'll be really pissed.  - This is Sawyer's plan. Let's go.

403
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,480
Sayid啊?
Sayid?

404
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,480
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

405
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,230
按你的吩咐 干活儿去了
Doing what you asked.

406
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,890
怎么那么长时间?
Then what took you so long?

407
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,550
我刚杀了一个手无缚鸡之力的人
I just shot an unarmed man.

408
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,800
我需要时间想想
I needed a moment.

409
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,600
Sayid 你杀了他吗?
Did you kill him, Sayid?

410
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,900
当然
Of course I did.

411
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,310
要是不信 你自己去看
Go and check, if you like.

412
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,650
快点儿 我们要赶船
Come on. We have a boat to catch.

413
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,830
我希望你知道目的地
I hope you know where you're going,

414
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,890
因为那个烟怪
'cause that smoke thing

415
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,540
比我们跑得快多了
runs a hell of a lot faster than we do.

416
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,540
- Sawyer 说这儿有个码头  - 在那儿!
- Sawyer said there'd be a dock around here somewhere.  - There they are!

417
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,370

- We sailin' home on this, huh?  - Won't work, not without a bearing.

三年来 达摩组织成员都是
For three years, the only way Dharma folk

乘潜水艇进进出出
ever got on or off this island was by sub,

422
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,440

423
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,840

424
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,930

我们要离开小岛
We're leaving the island.

429
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,850
那你们为什么不等John?
Then, uh, why aren't you waiting for John?

430
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,690
因为他不是John
Because that's not John,

431
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,550
不论他是谁 他不是我们的人
and whoever he is, he's not one of us.

432
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,370
Claire啊...
Claire...

433
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,500

437
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,880
- John向我保证...  - 不 我现在向你保证
- John promised me...  - No, I'm promising you.

438
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,810
他出生的时候 我就在现场
I was there when he was born.

439
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,510
他不应该由我来抚养
And I never should've raised him.

440
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,270
该抚养他的人 是你
It should've been you.

441
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,750
我是回来找你的 如此你们就可以团聚了
I came back to get you so you could be with him again.

442
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,060
Claire 这是我回来的唯一理由
It's the only reason I came back to the island, Claire.

443
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,170
所以 请跟我们走
So, please, come with us.

444
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,060
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

445
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,580
好吧 在Locke找来之前 快上船
All right. Get on the boat before Locke gets here.

446
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,580
他要是发现我们走了...
If he finds out we're gone...

447
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,610
他会很生气的
he's gonna be mad.

448
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,470
是你妈妈
It's your mom.

449
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,510

453
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,540
我会让他尽快回家 5点吧?
I'll have him home as soon as I can. Maybe, like, 5:00?

454
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,800
其实 我们完事后要吃个饭
Actually, um, we might grab a bite to eat afterwards.

455
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,980
所以 呃 7点吧?
So, uh... maybe more like 7:00?

456
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,820
好吧
All right.

457
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,260

你知道
You know,

461
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,290
听你祖父的遗愿
hearing your grandfather's will being read,

462
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,310
不是件好玩的事 但...
I know it's not the most fun, but...

463
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,150
很快就完了 我保证
it'll be over soon, I promise.

464
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,960
还有... 悲伤点没关系
And it's... it's okay to be sad.

465
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,740
我是为你而悲伤 爸爸
I'm sad for you, dad.

466
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,190
走吧
Let's go.

467

00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:21,805
我父亲的遗嘱里 有你的名字
you were in my father's will.

482
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:25,425
你介意告诉我 你是怎么认识他的吗?
Do you mind if I ask you how you knew him?

483
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,100
他也是我爸爸
He was my father, too.

484
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,490
抱歉 我接个电话
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

485
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,780
这是 呃 医院打来的
This is the, uh, this is the service.

486
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,790
对 我是Shephard医生
Yeah, this is Dr. Shephard.

487
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,110
不 不 现在不方便
No, no, it's not a very good time.

488
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,560
对 他们可以为他安排手术了
Yes, they can go ahead and prep him.

489
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,330
我20分钟到
I'm 20 minutes away.

490
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,370
抱歉 医院里有急诊
I'm so sorry. There's been an emergency at the hospital,

491
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,070
还有 呃...
and, um...

492
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,860
我们要再约时间了
We're gonna have to reschedule.

493
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,650
船长 我知道我问得有点儿晚
I know I'm a little late to the party, Captain,

494
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,040
但你介意告诉我 你的游玩计划吗?
but you mind filling us in on what your game plan is?

495
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,590
胸肌男 我的计划就是到九头蛇岛上去
My plan, chesty, is to land on Hydra Island,

496
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,290
跟Widmore拉拉近乎
Get ourselves nice and cuddly with Widmore

497
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,870
这样我们就有机会上潜水艇了
until we get a chance to jump on that sub.

498
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,460
然后我就拿枪逼着一个人
Then I'm gonna put a gun in someone's face

499
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,150
让他带我们回家
and make 'em take us home.

500
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,530
我喜欢这主意
I like that idea.

501
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,500
我看见船舱里有些罐头
I saw some canned food down in the galley.

502
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,940
有人饿了吗?
Anybody else starvin'?

503
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,880
雀斑女 过来掌会儿舵?
Freckles. Take the wheel a minute?

504
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,710
好的
Sure.

505
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,030
温柔点
Be nice.

506
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,390
好的 知道了
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,490
没有想到你会出现 医生
Didn't think you'd show up, doc.

508
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,760
什么?
Sorry?

509
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,180
你可不是个唯命是从的人
Taking orders ain't your strong suit.

510
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,990
很开心 最后还是见到你了
Nice to see you finally came around.

511
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,790
感觉有些不对
This doesn't feel right.

512
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,040
感觉什么不对呢?
What doesn't feel right?

513
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,470
离开这个岛
Leaving the island.

514
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,500
你想告诉我为什么不要离开吗?
You wanna tell me why not?

515
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,580
因为我仍然清晰地记得 我上次离开时的感受...
Because I remember how I felt last time I left...

516
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,640
感觉像是失去了部分自我
Like a part of me was missing.

517
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,220
他们有治那种幻觉的药 医生
They got pills for that, doc.

518
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,190
我们之所以被带到这里
We were brought here

519
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,580
是因为 我们注定要来这里做些什么的 James
because we're supposed to do something. James.

520
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,170
还有 如果Locke... 那个... 那个东西...
And if Locke... that... that thing...

521
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,880
想要我们离开呢?
wants us to leave?

522
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,370
如果我们留在岛上 或许会发生令它害怕的事吧
Maybe it's afraid of what happens if we stay.

523
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,520
滚下我的船去
Get off my damn boat.

524
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,580
什么?
What?

525
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,040
是时候做出抉择了
You got a decision to make and you make it now.

526
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,270
要不你跟着我们
Either you're with us,

527
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,970
继续对自己说这些疯话
you keep that damn crazy talk to yourself,

528
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,910
- 要不你就跳到海里去  - James 这样做是不对的
- or you're going in the water.  - James, this is a mistake.

529
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,780
而且我知道 你或多或少 也有这种感觉
And I know there's a part of you that feels that.

530
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,110
这个岛和我们还没完呢
The island is not done with us yet.

531
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,160
是呢 呃 但是我和这个岛已经玩完了
Yeah, well, I'm done with this island.

532
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,310
所以如果你执着于你的感受 Jack 那你就那么做吧
So if you wanna take a leap of faith, Jack, then take it.

533
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,590
滚下我的船去
Get off my damn boat.

534
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,940
对于Juliet因我而死 我真的很抱歉
I'm sorry that I got Juliet killed.

535
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,110
Jack啊?!
Jack?!

536
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,500
Jack啊?!
Jack?!

537
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,130
- 你都和他说什么了?  - 他现在反悔了
- What did you say to him?  - He changed his mind.

538
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,590
他反悔了 什么意思?!
What do you mean, he changed his mind?!

539
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,930
- 你都和他说了些什么?  - 他不跟我们一起走了
- What did you say to him?!  - He ain't comin' with us.

540
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,510
我们必须回去救他上来
We have to go back and get him.

541
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,950
我们不能再回头了 Kate
We're done going back, Kate.

542
00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:14,082

Jin啊?

543
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:16,692

Jin啊?

544
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:20,852

你醒了喔

545
00:36:21,942 --> 00:36:23,092

发生什么事了?

546
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,672

你中弹了

547
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:28,602

但是你会好起来的...

548
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:30,712

那咱们的孩子呢?

549
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:33,642

孩子很好

550
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:41,592

都结束了...

551
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:44,612

我们都会好起来的

552
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,560
所以这些年来
So all these years,

553
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,660
你根本不知道爷爷有另外一个孩子?

还有件麻烦事...

That's why we called you. We're in a bit over our heads here.

575
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,350

Everybody stay close. The camp's over here.

581
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,360
Locke很快就会知道
We're not gonna have much time

582
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,610
我们开走了他的船
before Locke's figured out we made off with his ride.

583
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,950
- 把手举起来!  - 嘿! 哇!

587
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,910
还有谁和你一起来的?
Who else is with you?

588
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,490
没别人了! 如果你是想知道Locke在哪里
Nobody! If you're wondering where Locke is,

589
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,450
他现在还在主岛呢

我从未停止过寻找你

你在搞什么呀?
What the hell are you doin'?

605
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,380
我像是在干什么呢? 把手举起来
What's it look like I'm doin'? Hands up now.

606
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,950
所有人都跪在地上!
On your knees, all of you!

607
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,930
