也不能说这是我们首要目的
Can't really say it's our primary objective.

5
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:32,022
那你们的首要目的是什么?

不要误解了

14
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:14,091
我觉得我真的不需要心理治疗
But i-i really don't think I need therapy.

15
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:19,064
我们倒不如叫聊天吧?
How about we call it "talking" instead of therapy?

16
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:22,098
-那好吧  -很好

他们都明星一样待我

我觉得我不想成为焦点

这让我觉得很孤立

嗯 也许你觉得是焦点

但你不算明星  很快

你会发现你和这里的其他人没有两样
You'll realize that you're no different than anyone here.

30
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:08,010
我知道 我没有那个意思
Oh, i-i know. i-i never meant that i...

31
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,091
Harper  很抱歉打扰了
Harper, I'm sorry for the interruption.

32
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,028
我知道你不想被打断

33

可是Ben说他想见见这位医生

你说过...  他们是我们的朋友

如果他们发现毒气的事情

82
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:58,017
那岛上的人都得死

00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:04,017
-你为什么不阻止他们  -因为Ben要你去
Why don't you stop them? because ben wants you to do it.

84

Ben在监狱里  怎么会知道他们的行踪
How can ben possibly know where they are when he's a prisoner?

85
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:10,034
那正是Ben想待的地方
Ben is exactly where he wants to be.

86
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,062
我该怎么去阻止他们
How am I supposed to stop them?

87
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:23,079
用枪指着他们  然后扣动扳机

88
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:29,096
你是谁

92
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:27,030
你还好吧

没关系  这不是你的错

106
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:21,010
一个个孕妇在这里死去

那会是谁的错?

00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:32,006
相信我  没人期待你一夜之间就能搞定
Believe me, nobody expects you to fix it overnight.

110
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:40,005

Harper讨厌我

00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:37,019
你得帮帮我
What I need is for you to help me.

142
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,025
你会帮我吗?
Will you help me?

143
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:49,060
如果我们整夜在赶  或许还可以追上他们
If we move all night, maybe we can still catch them.

144
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,068
谢谢
Thank you.

145
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:07,088
我觉得得走那边
I think it's that way.

146
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:14,032
但是要是我...
But what happens if i...

147
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:18,040
要是我失败了怎么办?
What if I can't do it?

148
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:21,001
Dan
Dan.

149
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:24,021
看着我
Look at me.

150
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,004
我知道你行的
I know you can do this.

151
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:33,025
我们动身吧
Should we get going?

152
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,002
好的
Yeah

153
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,095
快点
Come on.

154
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:46,087
哇  没事  没事  是Kate
Whoa, whoa, whoa. it's- it'skay. it's okay. it's Kate.

155
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,095
他们抓到了Miles?
So they have Miles?

156
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,033
是的  不过他没事
Yeah, but he's fine.

157
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,030
他们对他不错
They... they're treating him fine.

158
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:06,098
我还以为你们俩正和Jack在沙滩上
I thought you two are with jack at the beach.

159
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:10,019
你们在这里做什么?
What are you gs doing out here?

160
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:15,000
Jack正想和货船上的sayid和desmond通话
Jackas trying to communicate With sayid and desmond on the freighter,

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,088
但卫星电话电池耗尽了
But their sat phone ran out of juice.

162
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:19,002
死机了
It's totally dead.

163
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:21,019
我们没法和货船联系了
There's no way we can call the boat.

164
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,097
所以我们就自告奋勇几个
So we volunteered to get the spare batteries

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,016
去找直升机上仍下来的旅行包  里面有备用电池
Out of the packs that we threw out the chopper.

166
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,091
旅行包不是从飞机上仍下来了吗
So... if you threw your pack from the chopper,

167
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,030
这是什么?
What's that?

168
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:36,029
这个  嗯
This? uh...

169
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:37,039
这是
It's...

170
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,080
别人那借来的
Just borrowed is.

171
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,058
可以看下吗
Mind if I take a look?

172
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,010
随便  Dan  让她看吧
Go ahead, Dan. show her.

173
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,010
这是电池?
Batteries, huh?

174
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,094
这什么
What's this-uhh!

175
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:05,067
什么?
What?

176
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:14,028
那个女人  那个女人叫什么名字
That woman- what was her name?

177
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,013
Harper
Harper.

178
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:18,021
你们是朋友?
The two of you friends?

179
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:21,064
也不完全是  她是我的理疗师
Not exactly. she wamy therast.

180
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:23,008
你们配有理疗师?
You people had therapists?

181
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:25,038
干那工作  压力很大
It's very stressful.

182
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,010
虽说是你的理疗师  对你怀有敌意啊
Seemed kinda hostile, even for a therapist.

183
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,074
我相信肯定过去的有些事情
I'm sure there are things from your past

184
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:33,093
你提都不想提
That you'd rather not talk about.

185
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:36,050
是嘛  我的档案你都看到了啊
Yeah. you read them all in my file.

186
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:40,088
相信我  Jack  你一定不想看到我的档案
Trust me, Jack. you don't wanna see my file.

187
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,034
问题就出在
The problem occurs

188
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,089
在第六个月的时候
Somewhere during the second trimester,

189
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,072
当时母体的免疫系统正被激发
When the mother's immune system is triggered.

190
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,055
血液中的白细胞数量急剧下降
The white blood cell count plummets.

191
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:57,098
就好像  免疫系统对胚胎有排斥
It's like the... immune system turns on the fetus.

192
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,033
我可以看下吗
May i?

193
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,008
好的
Sure.

194
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,079
知道什么原因了吗
Any thought yet on a cause?

195
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,023
现在下定论还为时过早
Mm, it's really too early to tell, but only women

196
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:15,069
但只有在这个岛上怀孕的女人才有这种反应
Who've conceived on the island does it happen to...

197
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:17,086
-这让我很诧异  -juliet
Which makes me wonder- hey, juliet.

198
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,019
噢  ben  我不知道你在这
Oh, ben, I didn't know you were here.

199
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:28,037
Ethan生病了,冰箱李还有一份鸡蛋色拉
Ethan's out sick. I have an extra egg salad on rye.

200
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:31,060
-我就过来看看juliet要不要吃  -我吃过了  谢谢
I was just checking to see if juliet wants it. thanks. no, already ate.

201
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,082
噢 ,还有,十分钟后,我会和你妻子碰个面
Oh, besides, I have an appoinent with your wife in ten minutes.

202
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:38,059
好的  替我和她打个招呼
Great. tell her I said hi.

203
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:40,060
好的
Oh, will do.

204
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:42,057
Ben?
Ben?

205
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,033
我没事
No, I'm fine.

206
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:00,093
那么  juliet
So, juliet,

207
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:02,094
你觉得ben这人怎么样
What do you think of ben?

208
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:09,023
相当精明
Uh, very smart...

209
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:11,008
专注
And intense.

210
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:12,070
有挑战精神
Challenging.

211
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:15,029
他一直对我很好
He's been really good to me.

212
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:19,028
那是当然啦  你好像喜欢他
Of course he has. you look just like her.

213
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:20,052
什么
I'm sorry?

214
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,071
我发现你和我丈夫关系很好
And I see you and my husband have become friendly.

215
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:30,035
是啊  他人不错
Yeah. he's great.

216
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:33,012
他确实很能干
He's been really helpful.

217
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,012
你什么时候开始和他上床的?
When did you start sleeping with him?

218
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,022
什么?
What?

219
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,083
听着  juliet  不要当我是白痴
Look, juliet, I'm not an idiot.

220
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:49,036
你就直说吧  什么时候
So just tell me. when did it start?

221
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:54,097
-我根本就没有  -我们已经分手了
Okay. I'not doing this. we're done.

222
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,092
你就别在耍我了
Now please respect me enough

223
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:59,052
别再装了  做都做了
To spare me the pretense that you are actually offended.

224
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:02,038
我都知道了
I know.

225
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,029
我跟踪你
I followed you.

226
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,050
监视你
Watched you.

227
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,069
对不起
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:19,001
无所谓了
It doesn't matter anymore.

229
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:22,031
现在重要的是你得听我的
But what does matter is that you listen to me

230
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,096
你给我记着
And that you believe me.

231
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,033
要是你再和goodwin
And if you continue

232
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:32,095
乱搞的话
To have a relationship with goodwin,

233
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:35,073
后果自负吧
There will be consequences.

234
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,083
我不想伤他的心
I don't want him to get hurt.

235
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,092
我永远都不愿伤害他
I would never hurt him.

236
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:44,047
我不是在说你
Look it, I am not talking about you.

237
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,057
我说的是ben
I am talking about ben.

238
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:56,046
嗨  john
Hi, john.

239
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,011
嗨  claire
Hey, claire.

240
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:04,012
能为你效劳吗
Is there something I can do for you?

241
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,012
我想知道你把Miles怎么了
I wanna know what's going on with miles.

242
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,085
现在还不好说
Right now not a whole lot.

243
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,093
我给他吃的喝的
I'm... bringing him food and water

244
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,097
直到他决定开口再决定
Until he decides to talk.

245
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,056
我想和他谈谈
I'd like to talk to him melf.

246
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:21,039
-为什么?  -John  我们得查出
And why would you want to do that? john, we have to find out

247
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,070
他们是谁  来自哪里
Who these people are and where they came from

248
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,086
为什么不愿救我们
And why they're not interested ine scuing us.

249
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,058
难度你觉得这些我都问不出来?
And you don't think I'm gonna get that out of him?

250
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:28,056
不是的  我
No, i...

251
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,016
我想也许我们的方法不对头
I just think we might be taking the wrong approach.

252
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:36,088
我是说  你杀了一个  ben开枪打死了一个
I mean, you killed one, ben shot one,

253
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,096
现在还拘捕了一个
And now we're holding one prisoner.

254
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,053
你知道  这样就不难理解
You know, it's not hard to understand

255
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:43,084
为什么他们认为我们是有敌意的
Why they might think we're hostile.

256
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:48,015
或许我要相对友好些
I might be just a little less intimidating.

257
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,076
你就死了这条心吧  claire
It's not gonna happen, claire.

258
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:54,092
-John  我不是  -你还记得charlie怎么说这些人的吗
John, I don't- you do remember what charlie said about these people.

259
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:56,020
charlie只是说
All charlie said

260
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,067
他们的船  不是吗
Was whose boat it isn't.

261
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:03,012
你就不想知道这些船是谁的?
Don't you wanna know whose boat it is?

262
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:26,034
今天吃兔子肉?
Rabbit today?

263
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,095
鸡吃完了
Running out of chickens.

264
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:34,010
上面没有编号的吧?
This didn't ve a number on it, did it?

265
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,022
吃吧  再把衣服换一换  完了放门边
Eat, change, put your laundry and dishes the door.

266
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:41,065
十五分钟后我来拿
I'll be back to collect them in 15 mites.

267
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:43,098
革命开始了吗?  或者叫
So has the revolution begun yet? or...

268
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,031
你说什么?
what are you talking about?

269
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:55,012
你是这里的头
Well, you're the leader now.

270
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:56,096
我知道这个头不好当
I know it's a tough position.

271
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:58,044
你得不断地应对人们的猜疑
You have to deal with all those people

272
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,099
他们总在怀疑你的决定
Constantly second-guessing your decisions,

273
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,067
可是他们的猜虑总是很无知  不是吗
And it always starts out so innocently, doesn't it?

274
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,086
问这问那   说三道四的
A question here, a comment there,

275
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:07,074
你要是一不小心
And then if you're not careful,

276
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:11,046
就肯定非得发生暴动不可
You find you have a full-blown insurrection on your hands.

277
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:15,051
相信我  你们的人一定会很愤怒
Believe me, your peopl are gonna be so angry

278
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:18,073
当他们知道你仍然没有什么计划
When they realize you still don't have a plan.

279
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:23,087
这么说你有计划了
and now you assure me that you got a plan.

280
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:25,090
我早有安排了
I always have a plan.

281
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,023
这和你筹集320万有关?
Does it involve you raising $3.2 million?

282
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,095
那可不是一笔小数目啊
Phew. that's a lot of money.

283
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,031
等等
Wait.

284
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:41,024
可能这个能让你开始
Maybe this'll get you started.

285
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,059
把你的脏衣服放到门旁边
Put your laundry and dishes by the door.

286
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:50,029
我能帮助你  John  我们的道是一样的
I can help you, John. we have shared interests...

287
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:53,073
或者  至少我们有共同的敌人
Or at least a common enemy.

288
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:55,066
你是指船上的那些人
And that would be our friends on the freighter.

289
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:59,016
不是他们  是他们的雇主
Not them. the one they work for.

290
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,073
把我放出去  给我点所谓的自由
Let me out of here. give me some semblance of freedom,

291
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:09,019
让我在床上睡觉  用碗吃东西
Let me sleep in a bed and eat with utensils,

292
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:11,019
我向你保证  我会告诉你想知道的
And I give you my word I'll tell you everything you wanna know

293
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,086
-那个派船来的人的一切事情  -但是  想想看
About the person who sent the freighter. yeah, but see,

294
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,077
这有个问题,我不相信你说的
There's the problem. I don't trust your word.

295
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:18,027
那好吧
All right, then.

296
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,083
我看我早晚都得告诉你
I guess I'll have to show you.

297
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:45,078
我希望这个味道应该不错
I hope this is good.

298
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:49,040
我不懂葡萄酒  就从潜水艇里 拿了这瓶
I don't know much about wine. I swiped this off the sub.

299
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:10,010
我真希望我们能一直这样
I wish we could do this all the time.

300
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,075
我很讨厌我们非得这样
I hate that we have to be so...

301
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:15,029
偷偷摸摸的
Private.

302
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,094
偷偷摸摸怎么了?
What's the matter with being private?

303
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:22,024
太可笑了,我在长椅上睡了一年了
So ridiculous. I've been sleeping on the couch for a year.

304
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,088
为什么我不能告诉她?
Why am I not just telling her?

305
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:29,032
我觉得这不是个好主意
I don't think it's a good idea.

306
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:38,017
为什么?
Why not?

307
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:41,029
Ben不喜欢这样
Ben wouldn't like it.

308
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:44,024
这是关键?  你在乎Ben的感受?
That's what this is about? you're worried about Ben?

309
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,083
为什么?  因为他喜欢你?
Why? because he has a crush on you?

310
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:52,065
-你知道?  -别逗了  每个人都知道
You know? come on. everyone knows.

311
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:54,097
他像宠物一样跟着你转
He follows you  like a papy.

312
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:59,007
你不觉得这有问题吗?
And you don't think that's a problem?

313
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:00,097
现在她一定在离这不足公里的地方猫着
Now a little less than a kilometer from here,

314
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:03,065
他让我负责化学品
He has me working with chemicals

315
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:05,062
如果我按错了按钮
That could kill every man, woman and child on this island

316
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,091
那足够杀掉这个岛上的男女老幼
If I flip the wrong switch.

317
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:12,016
相信我  Ben的权利够大了
Trust me, Ben has enough on his plate.

318
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,084
他根本不管你和我
The last thing he cares about is you and me.

319
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:20,007
有种感觉  他会不高兴的
get the feeling that he would be upset.

320
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:23,034
他会怎么做?
What's Ben gonna do?

321
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,066
Goodwin
Goodwin!

322
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,060
-你看见机尾降落在哪了吗?  -是的  可能在水里
You see where the tail landed? yeah, probably in the water.

323
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,028
你跑过去  要在一小时之内到达海岸
You run and you can get to the shore in an hour.

324
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,024
Ethan  你去机身那边
Ethan, get up the to that fuselage.

325
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:48,072
那里可能会有生还者  你装成一个乘客
There may actually be survivors, and u're one of 'em-

326
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:50,054
处于深深的恐惧中
A passenger. you're in shock.

327
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:52,031
如果他们问及就编个能过的去的故事
Come with an adequate story if they ask.

328
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:53,050
如果他们不问  就什么也别说
stay quiet if they don't.

329
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,073
听着  不要卷入其中
Listen, learn, don't get involved.

330
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,070
三天内我要名单  出发吧
I want the lists in three days.. go

331
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:19,038
出问题了  我们早就应该
Something's wrong. we should've...

332
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:20,097
我们早该追上他们了
We should've caught up with 'em by now.

333
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:23,005
Jack  这些人可能跳伞了
These people may be jumped out of helicopter, jack.

334
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:25,065
让他们尝尝怀疑的代价吧
Let's give 'em e benefit of the doubt.

335
00:23:31,024 --> 00:23:35,000
好了好了  没事了
Hey. hey, it's okay it's okay. hey.

336
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,066
没事了
It's all right. it's okay. hey.

337
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,063
没事了
It's okay.

338
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:44,031
没事了  别担心
It's all right. come on.

339
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,020
慢慢来
Take it easy.

340
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,058
别紧张
Take it easy.

341
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:51,077
我去弄点水
I'll go get her some water.

342
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:54,016
好的  谢谢
Yeah thanks.

343
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,083
发生什么了?
What happened?

344
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:04,037
我正打算回到海滩
I was going back to the beach, and...

345
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:07,014
我碰见Faraday和那个女人

346
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:11,010
charlotte  我想是她袭击了我
Um... charlotte. I think she hit me.

347
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,062
他们昨晚在营地失踪了
They disappeared out of camp last night.

348
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:15,035
我们本打算追上他们
We've been trying to catch up with them.

349
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,018
你知道他们要去哪吗?
Do you know where they were headed?

350
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,034
类似于
Some sort of...

351
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:23,056
发电站之类的地方
Power station.

352
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:25,025
Jack

353

他们戴着防毒面具
They had gas masks.

354
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:34,050
Juliet

Juliet
Juliet!

358
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,079
别玩了  别玩花样了
All right, no tricks.

359
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,062
你没打算把我带出丛林
You're not leading me out into the jungle

360
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:07,028
你可以消失

361
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:09,072
或者在我身后放冷枪
Or shoot me in t back.

362
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,029
别玩花样了  John
No tricks, John.

363
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:14,016
我们甚至不用离开这房子
We don't even have to leave the living room.

364
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:18,016
那让我们开始吧
So let's have it.

365
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,052
我们有个交易  是吧?
We have a deal, right?

366
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,002
我怎么知道你会不会跑
How do I know you're not gonna run off

367
00:25:23,002 --> 00:25:25,027
然后召集你的旧部?
And meet your people first chance you get?

368
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:26,071
如果我的人还需要我  John
If my people still wanted me, john,

369
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:29,033
他们早就把这营地推平了
They would've stormed this camp long ago.

370
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:37,097
在那副画后面
It's behind that picture.

371
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:52,094
密码是36, 15, 28
36, 15, 28.

372
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,038
"红袜队的比赛"?
"red sox"?

373
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,030
我把那场比赛录下来了
I taped over the game.

374
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:51,075
这是Chles Widmore

375
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:57,034
就是他派船来的

376
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:03,011
就是他一直在寻找这个岛
This is the man that's been trying to find the island.

377
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,009
那个蒙着眼的人是谁?
Who's the man in the blindfold?

378
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,081
我的人里有一个不幸被抓到了
One of my people that had the misfortune to get caught.

379
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:18,087
-Widmore怎么知道这个岛的?  -不知道 但他就是知道
How does widmore know about the island? I don't know, but he does.

380
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:21,031
他想要什么?
What does he want?

381
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:24,022
John  三个月前在佛罗里达的Gainesville

圣母玛利亚出现在

383
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:28,057
一个旧的居住区的附近
In a patch of mold on the side of an old housing complex.

384
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:29,060
当他说出那些话
When the word got out,

385
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,090
有超过5000人看到了她的脸
Over 5,000 people came to see her face for themselves.

386
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,019
你在空难中幸存了
You've survived an airline crash on this island.

387
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:38,052
前一分钟  你在坐在轮椅上
One minute, you're in a wheelchair.

388
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:41,029
下一分钟  你就能跳舞了
The next minute, you're doing jumping jacks.

389
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:43,077
如果有5000个人看到模具
If 5,000 people came out to see a piece of mold,

390
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:47,015
那么多少人会来这看你呢?

391
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,045
Charles Widmore想要开发这个岛

392
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:58,001
他会不息一切代价完成
And he'll do everything in his power to possess it.

393
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,072
我所知道关于charles widmore的所有事

都在这个文件里

395
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:21,000
有些很模糊  有些全凭猜测
Some of it's vague, some of it's guesswork,

396
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,079
有些很具体
Some of it's concrete.

397
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,088
这是所有的事情  现在都归你了
But this is everything, and now it's all yours.

398
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:32,087
很抱歉  我没有早点告诉你这些
I'm sorry I did't tell you all this sooner.

399
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:38,025
但这是我唯一的筹码了
But it was the only bargaining chip I had left.

400
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,069
还有一件事我要知道
There's one more thing I need to know.

401
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,094
那个在船上的你的旧部
Your man on the boat...

402
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:48,040
我要你告诉我他是谁
I want you to tell me who it is.

403
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:52,059
好的
All right.

404
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,016
但是你可能想坐下
But you might want to sit down.

405
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:06,067
她从这里来
She came through here.

406
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,014
他们也是  大约在她前面半小时左右

407
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:14,040
发生什么了?
What happened?

408
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,046
对不起?
Sorry?

409
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,088
在locke那里  为什么你要留下?
At locke's- why did you stay?

410
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:22,011
我想找点东西
I stayed because I had to find something out.

411
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,028
你想告诉我,或者我们继续走,直到走出丛林
Are you gonna tell me, Or are we gonna keep walking thugh the jungle

412
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,019
如果不重要的话?
Like it doesn't matter?

413
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,054
我在那里是想知道
I stayed to find out

414
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:38,037
船上的人知不知道我是谁
If the people on the freighter know who I am,

415
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:40,084
他们是否知道我是一个逃犯

439
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:36,089
真的适合呆在这儿吗?

他们在名单上  Juliet

Who are we to question who's on the list and who's not?
