1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,044
《迷失》前情提要...
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,099
你怎么会认识我父亲
How did you know my father?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,012
他过来看他女儿
He came to see his daughter.

4
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:09,099
我女儿也在那架飞机上
My daughter was on your plane.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,073
她叫Claire
Her name was Claire.

6
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,092
我们过来各取一份
We're here to get a blood sample from you

7
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:20,039
-你和你儿子Aaron的血液样本  -为什么
- And one from your son aaron. - Why?

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,055
以确定你和这个孩子的关系
To determine your relationship to the child.

9
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,082
你要去哪  妈妈
Where you going, mommy?

10
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,095
我们去度假  宝贝
We're going on vacation, baby.

11
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:29,099
等等  你在洛杉矶吗  我当然有时间见面
Wait, you're in l.a.? Of course I can meet, yeah.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,076
你好  Kate
Hello, Kate.

13
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,025
-你怎么样  -扶我上车
- You okay? - Get me to the car.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,022
-Sayid  你被袭击了  -Hurley在哪
- Sayid, you've been attacked. - Where's Hurley?

15
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:44,078
John  拯救这座岛的唯一方法
The only way to save the island, John,

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,049
就是让你的人回来
Is to get your people back here.

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,043
我应该怎么做
How? How am I supposed to do that?

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,033
-怎么了  -你...
- What? - You've...

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,063
你知道我这是怎么了吗
Do you know what's happening to me?

20
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:12,030
Charlotte  Charlotte
Charlotte? Charlotte?

21
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:35,075
不用这么蹑手蹑脚的
Oh, you don't have to whisper.

22
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,086
他睡着了就没关系了
When he's out, he's out.

23
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,005
总算有个人能睡得着了
At least one of us can sleep.

24
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:44,090
我至少得花上两个晚上
It's gonna take more than two nights

25
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:49,003
才能习惯在普通的床上睡觉
For me to get used to sleeping in a normal bed.

26
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,069
我们该拿他怎么办
What are we gonna do about him?

27
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:55,009
我是说Aaron
About Aaron.

28
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,055
我不知道
I don't know.

29
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:59,053
我反复考虑过关于他的问题
I've been thinking a lot about him.

30
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:02,089
你知道Clair曾经去过洛杉矶
Did you know that Claire was flying to l.a.

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,066
-打算让别人收养他吗  -我不知道
- To give him up for adoption? - No. No, I didn't.

32
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,075
我觉得应该对外宣称他是我儿子
I think we should say he's mine.

33
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:30,019
-什么  -我们可以说我在被捕的时候
- What? - We could say that I was six months pregnant

34
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,059
已经有六个月身孕
When I was arrested

35
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,082
然后我在岛上生下了他
And that I gave birth to him on the island.

36
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:37,079
- 没人会知道的  -Kate  不   你不必...
- No one would ever know.- Kate, no. You don't have to...

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,079
一定还有其它的办法
There's other ways to do this.

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,032
我们已经失去了他们  Michael  Jin Sawyer...
After everyone we've lost-- Michael, Jin, Sawyer...

39
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,010
我不能再失去他
I can't lose him, too.

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,032
Sawyer并没有死
Sawyer's not dead.

41
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,062
是
No.

42
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:54,080
但他已经远去了
But he's gone.

43
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,046
晚安  Jack
Good night, Jack.

44
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,090
Kate
Kate...

45
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:10,045
如果我们想安全获救
If we're gonna be safe,

46
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:13,039
如果我们想保护留在岛上的其他人
If we're gonna protect the people that we left behind,

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,044
明天一早  我就要去
Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna have to

48
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:17,002
说服大家编造谎言
Convince everyone to lie.

49
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:19,095
但凭我一己之力  是无法说服他们的
If it's just me, they're never gonna go for it.

50
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:23,025
所以我首先要说服你
So I'm gonna turn to you first.

51
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:26,010
你支持我吗
Are you with me?

52
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:39,066
我一直都是支持你的
I have always been with you.

53
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,030
三年后
Three Years Later

54
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,079
合身吗
How does it fit?

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,084
很合身  谢谢你借我穿
It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.

56
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,073
你穿上真不错
Looks great on you.

57
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:07,045
-你确定要这么做吗  -这可是你的主意
- Are you sure you want to do this? - It was your idea.

58
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,085
妈妈
Mommy!

59
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:13,062
Aaron宝贝  妈妈要出去办点事
Aaron, honey, mommy's gonna run out and do an errand.

60
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:17,015
我很快就回来  然后我们就回家
I'll be right back. Okay? And then we can go home.

61
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:18,058
别担心我们  Kate
Don't worry about us, Kate.

62
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:22,042
冰箱里有糖果  还有许多电视节目
There's candy in the minibar and a hundred channels on tv.

63
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,092
我们在这里会很好的
We're going to be just fine here.

64
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,069
Sun
Sun...

65
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,022
真不知道没有你我该怎么办
I don't know what I would've done if you weren't here.

66
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:31,072
谢谢你
Thank you.

67
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:34,040
这是朋友该做的
It's what any friend would do.

68
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:38,029
好了  我很快就回来
Okay, well, I will be back soon.

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,029
你和Sun好好相处
Okay, you be good for Sun.

70
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,033
好吗  亲爱的
Okay, honey?

71
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:45,066
祝你好运
Good luck.

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,032
这是给你的  Kwon小姐
Delivery for you, Ms. Kwon.

73
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,043
-谢谢你  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thanks.

74
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,020
我去去就来  宝贝

Charlotte  Charlotte
Charlotte? Charlotte?

84
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,040
到底是怎么回事
What the hell's wrong with her?

85
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,075
她已经昏过去十分钟了
She's been out for ten minutes.

86
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:26,091
别嚷嚷了  James
Stop shouting, James.

87
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,025
给你
Hey, man.

88
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:33,060
谢谢
Thank you.

89
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:36,060
如果你知道什么情况  Daniel
If there's something that you want to tell me, Daniel,

90
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,030
最好现在就说
Now would be a good time.

91
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,075
我不太明白你的意思
I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

92
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:43,020
她问你是否知道你女朋友昏迷的原因
She's asking if you know why your girlfriend had a seizure.

93
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:44,070
让我们单独谈谈  好吗
Give us some space, would you?

94
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,020
她之所以会这样  都是因为闪光不断出现
She's like this 'cause the sky keeps lighting up.

95
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,015
他明知道会这样
He knew this would happen

96
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:50,026
-却连个屁都不放...-James
- And he didn't say squat about it. - James...

97
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:51,071
走开
Go away.

98
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:04,001
你知道会发生这种情况吗
Did you know that this would happen?

99
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:07,003
我认为...
I thought...

100
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:09,004
我认为有可能
I thought it might.

101
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:13,033
我觉得这是神经学现象
I think it's neurological.

102
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:15,033
人的大脑有一个内部生物钟
Our brains have an internal clock,

103
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,015
对时间的意识
A sense of time.

104
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:19,050
这些闪光...扰乱了生物钟
The flashes... throw the clock off.

105
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:24,011
就像时差混乱
It's like really bad jet lag.

106
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:29,051
但时差混乱不会致人出血  Daniel
Really bad jet lag doesn't make you hemorrhage, Daniel.

107
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:34,075
你知道为什么我们其它人没有这种情况吗
You wanna tell me why it isn't happening to the rest of us?

108
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:36,027
不知道
I don't know.

109
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:42,031
幸好没有
But thank god it's not.

110
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,006
谢谢你的耐心等候
Thank you for waiting.

111
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,009
我的助理好好招待你了吗
Did my assistant offer you something to drink?

112
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,033
是的  很好  谢谢
Um, yes. I'm fine, thank you.

113
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:59,051
很好  Austen小姐  请坐
Good. Please, Ms. Austen, sit.

114
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:03,020
那么
So...

115
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,054
有什么问题
How can I help you?

116
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,076
Norton先生
Mr. Norton,

117
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:11,016
当你到我家来取我和我儿子
When you came to my house looking for blood samples

118
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:13,050
血液样本时
From me and my son,

119
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:16,070
我问你的客户是谁
I asked you who your client was...

120
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,070
我说无法透露
And I said I couldn't tell you.

121
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:21,091
对  我想和你作个交易
Yeah. I'm here to offer you a deal.

122
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:25,020
我把血液样本给你
I'll give you the blood samples,

123
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:28,040
但是  我想先和你的客户谈谈
But first, I wanna talk to your client.

124
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,070
考虑到你的要求
Considering what you're asking for,

125
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:32,060
这样的做法更合理
That's more than reasonable.

126
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:35,070
好吧  我一会要和客户见面
Well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today,

127
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,016
我一定把你的要求转述给他
And I will be sure to pass along your offer.

128
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:43,030
但是我很确定答案将会是
But I am pretty sure of what the answer's gonna be--

129
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,063
不行
No.

130
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,053
至于原因  当然是
And the reason, of course,

131
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:49,020
你没有任何资格来谈条件
Is that you're in no position to be making any kind of deals,

132
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,076
而我们都清楚
And we both know it.

133
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:52,080
我这里有一份已经签署的法庭命令可以强制你
I have a signed court order compelling you

134
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,016
允许我们核实你是否是孩子的母亲
To let us confirm that you're the child's mother.

135
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:58,016
我完全可以今天就派地方司法官去执行
I could send the sheriff over there today and make you do it,

136
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:00,066
但是我的客户坚持要求我们
But my client insists that we...

137
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:04,040
私下转移监护权
Handle the exchange of custody quietly.

138
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,050
你说的"转移监护权"是什么意思
What do you mean "exchange of custody"?

139
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:10,040
你完全明白我是什么意思
You know exactly what I mean.

140
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,073
不  我
No, I...

141
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:14,086
Norton先生
Mr. Norton,

142
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:18,026
我只是想知道谁会这样对我
I just wanna know who is doing this to me.

143
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:21,023
你自食其果
You did this to yourself.

144
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:24,097
现在是时候做准备了  Austen小姐
Now it is time you prepare yourself, Ms. Austen.

145
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:29,037
你将会失去这个男孩
You are going to lose the boy.

146
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:48,026
我们必须回到兰花站那里去
We have to go back to the Orchid.

147
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:49,073
什么
Excuse me?

148
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:51,033
兰花站
The Orchid.

149
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:55,041
那是一切开始的地方  也许会是终结的地方
That's where all this started. maybe it's where it'll all stop.

150
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:59,066
温室离这里很远
That greenhouse is a long ways away.

151
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:03,033
你说过你在后面的海滩有艘zodiac的救生艇
You said you had a zodiac raft back at the beach.

152
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,083
我们可以坐那艇  从小岛的角落抄近路过去
We could take that, cut around the horn of the island,

153
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:06,089
只要花一半的时间
Be at the orchid in half the time.

154
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,065
让我猜猜,到了那里你一定知道我们该怎么做
And let me guess. You know exactly what to do when we get there.

155
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:10,070
不  一点都不知道
No, not exactly at all,

156
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,061
但是我知道Ben就是用它离开这个岛的
But I know that Ben used it to leave the island.

157
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:16,019
如果我照样做  我们也可以得救
And if I can do the same thing, I believe I can save us.

158
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:18,006
那你要怎么做呢
And how you gonna do that?

159
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,020
这里发生的一切都是因为他们离开了
This is all happening because they left.

160
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:23,087
我认为如果把他们带回来  这一切就会停止
I think it'll stop if I can bring them back.

161
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:28,002
-把谁带回来  -Jack  Sun  Sayid  Hugo  Kate
- Bring who back? - Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate.

162
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,038
船炸毁了  而直升机很可能在上面
The boat blew up, and that chopper was probably on it.

163
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,058
他们没有死  James
They're not dead, James.

164
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:34,098
-谁说的  -那无关紧要
- Says who? - That doesn't matter.

165
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,015
重要的是他们会回来
All that matters is they've gotta come back.

166
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:39,059
我必须让他们回来
I have to make them come back...

167
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,022
即使会让我丧命
Even if it kills me.

168
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:47,076
你不想让他们回来吗  James
Don't you want 'em to come back, James?

169
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:51,052
你不想让她回来吗
Don't you want her to come back?

170
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,079
我想什么无关紧要
It doesn't matter what I want.

171
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:03,026
她醒了
She's waking up!

172
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:10,029
你还好吗
Are you okay?

173
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,015
你是谁
Who are you?

174
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:15,091
是我啊
It's me.

175
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,069
Danniel啊
It's daniel.

176
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,092
Daniel
Daniel.

177
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,012
我的头
Oh, my head.

178
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,068
怎么了
What happened?

179
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:37,018
又来了一次闪光  你晕倒了
There was another flash. you passed out.

180
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,081
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

181
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:42,015
有点儿晕  但是
A bit dizzy, but...

182
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,045
我还好
I'm fine.

183
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:45,058
很好
Good.

184
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,048
好啊  一切恢复正常了
Hooray. Everything's back to normal.

185
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,081
现在怎么办
Now what?

186
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:53,028
我告诉你怎么办
I'll tell you "now what."

187
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,026
我们要回兰花站
We're going to the orchid.

188
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,068
瞳孔扩张基本恢复正常
Dilation's almost back to normal.

189
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,038
真好  把输液管给我拔下来然后出发
Good. Now take this i.v. out of my arm, and let's go.

190
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,057
Sayid  你已经失去知觉42个小时
Sayid, you were unconscious for 42 hours.

191
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:24,098
你的身体里的镇定剂相当于一匹马用的三倍
You had the equivalent of three doses of horse tranquilizer In your system.

192
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:27,012
如果你已经派那个人去Hurley家
If you sent that man to Hurley's house,

193
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,035
我们现在就得离开
we have to leave now.

194
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:31,008
你需要放松  Ben不会伤害Hurley
You need to relax. Ben is not gonna hurt Hurley.

195
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:33,004
Ben是我们一伙的
Ben is on our side.

196
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,011
他只和自己一伙
The only side he's on is his own.

197
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,008
Shephard医生
Dr. Shephard?

198
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,092
我是Ariza医生  临床治疗主管
I'm Dr. Ariza, director of clinical services.

199
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,058
能和你说句话吗
A word with you, please?

200
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:49,082
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

201
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,024
你知道自己在干什么
What do you think you are doing here?

202
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:54,024
我在治疗病人
I was treating a patient.

203
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,044
我道歉  这是急诊
I apologize. It was an emergency.

204
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:59,021
我知道  你因为滥用药物被停职了
I know that-- you were suspended on charges of substance abuse.

205
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:00,030
不管是不是急诊
Emergency or not,

206
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,093
Shephard医生  这里都没你的事
Dr. Shephard, you have no business being here.

207
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:05,011
我明白,我会对自己的行为负全部责任
I understand, And I take full responsibility for my actions.

208
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,064
不是的  医生
No, doctor.

209
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,051
是医院为你的行为负全部责任
The hospital takes full responsibility for your actions,

210
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:11,008
这让我们得对他们负责
And that makes us liable for them.

211
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,009
失陪
Excuse me.

Oh, and tell Sayid I did exactly what he said.

不是给你打针
I won't have to give you an injection.

228
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,092
只是把药放到你的输液管里
Put this right in your i.v. line.

229
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:36,046

-好了  说吧  说吧  -地址在我口袋里
- Okay, talk, talk. - Address--it's in my pocket.

231
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,082

听着  我不在家
Look, I'm not at home, okay? I'm...

242

Sorry, ben. I'm not letting you get anywhere near him.

You have friends in trouble. let's get them to safety

256
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:36,004
事后再说丑话吧
And save the dirty linen for later.

257
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,057
我来开车
I'll drive.

258
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:40,062
找到Kate之后
After you get kate,

259
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:43,030
在长滩码头  支路23号碰头
Meet us at the long beach marina, slip 23.

260
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:46,031
Jack  要抓紧  我们没时间了
And, jack... hurry. we're running out of time.

261
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:57,046
Locke
Hey, locke?

262
00:16:58,002 --> 00:16:59,067
你要怎么和她说
What are you gonna say to her

263
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,084
对谁
Sorry?

你怎么说服她回来
What are you gonna say to her to get her to come back?

266
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:09,001
我还没想好
I haven't figured that out yet.

267
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,027
告诉你吧
Well, let me tell you something.

268
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,094
她很兴奋
She was pretty excited

269
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:15,048
能跳上飞机离开这里
To hop on that chopper and get the hell out of here.

270
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,082
那是什么
What the hell is that?

271
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:36,017
不管是什么  离它远点
Whatever it is, we better stay clear of it.

272
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:39,055
海滩在这边
Beach is this way.

273
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,082

John
John...

我们得继续前进
We need to keep moving.

277

你的头还疼吗
Hey. how's your headache?

278
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,022
好些了
Better.

279
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:19,020
脚都走酸了  哪里顾得上头疼
Nothing like sore feet to take your mind off your head, eh?

280
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,070
别担心
Well, don't worry.

281
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,096
到了海边  我们就能坐上Zodiac
Once we get to the beach, we're gonna take the zodiac

282
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:25,043
去岛的另一边休息
Around the other side of the island and rest.

283
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:28,070
你真好  不过不用哄我  我没事
You're sweet, but you don't need to baby me. I'm fine.

284
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,073
没事吧
You okay?

285
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:35,044
我很好
I'm peachy.

286
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:39,070
又怎么了
Now what?

287
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,077
大家都别动
Nobody move.

288
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:50,024
-James  -我会小心
- James!  - I got this.

289
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,096
它知道我不想要它  会把它送走
It knows I don't want it, and I was gonna give it away.

290
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:05,059
婴儿都懂的
Babies know that stuff.

291
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,056
好吧  坚持住  听着
Okay, no, no, hang on. listen, listen.

292
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,073
你想要这孩子吗
Do you want this baby?

293
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:12,019
你希望它安全健康吗
Do you want it to be safe and healthy?

294
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,019
你不是一个人
You're not alone in this.

295
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,049
我们都关心你  这是我们大家的孩子
We are all here for you. this baby is all of ours.

296
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,056
我要你用力
But I need you to push.

297
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,037
好吗
Okay?

298
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,066
一  二  三
One, two, three...

299
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,066
用力  用力
Push! push!

300
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,047
加油  Claire  用力
Come on, claire! push!

301
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:36,073
好极了  要出来了
Aah! okay! he's coming!

302
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,033
用力  使劲
Push! push! push! push!

303
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:42,090
使劲  再用力
Push! push! push! push!

304
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,090
James
James?

305
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,070
怎么回事
What happened?

306
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:36,074
你看到什么了吗  James
Did you see something out here, james?

307
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,079
无所谓了
Don't matter.

308
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,097
已经消失了
It's gone now.

309
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:22,019
你刮胡子了
You shaved your beard.

310
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,039
是呀
Yeah.

311
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,014
想要改变一下
Just needed a change.

312
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,087
听着  Jack
Look, jack, uh...

313
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:37,027
我不知道你为什么来电话
I don't know why you called,

314
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:40,062
但我现在什么都做不了
But I can't be dealing with this right now.

315
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:44,096
出什么事了
What's going on?

316
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:46,051
没事  只是
Nothing. just...

317
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:49,040
-走吧  好吗  -为什么不告诉我
- Can you just go?  - why don't you just tell me?

318
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,016
Jack  求你走吧
Jack, please, just go.

319
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:53,021
Kate  告诉我
Kate, please, tell me.

320
00:21:57,091 --> 00:22:00,030
有人想要Aaron
Somebody wants aaron.

321
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:02,056
什么
What?

322
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:04,033
有一个律师
There's a lawyer in there.

323
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:06,036
他的客户  他们知道我们在说谎
His clients-- they know we're lying.

324
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:07,086
他们知道我不是他妈妈
They know I'm not his mom,

325
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,040
要把他带走
And they're gonna take him away.

326
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,044
谁要把他带走
Who's gonna take him away?

327
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:17,083
你要干什么
What--what are you doing?

328
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:21,007
我得走了  你上不上车
Look, I gotta go, all right? get in or don't.

329
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:38,063
喂
Hey.

330
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:41,063
能告诉我你在那看见了谁吗
You ready to tell me who you saw back there?

331
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:44,073
我都说了  没什么
Already told you. it was nothin'.

332
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:48,020
我们都知道闪光之前的时间  James
You and I both know when we were before the flash, james.

333
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:50,033
你到底看见谁了
So who was it you saw?

334
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:54,003
Charlie  Shannon  还是你自己
Charlie? shannon? yourself?

335
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:58,056
你怎么会知道当时的时间  小Johnny
And how is it that you knew when we were, johnny boy?

336
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:03,001
那束光  是从舱门过来的  对吗
That light in the sky--it was from the hatch, wasn't it?

337
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:08,006
Boone死的那天晚上
The night that boone died...

338
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:09,073
我去了那里
I went out there

339
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:12,070
用尽全力的砸门
And started pounding on it as hard as I could.

340
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:15,076
我很困惑  很害怕
I was... confused... scared.

341
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:18,023
像个白痴一样说傻话
Babbling like an idiot,

342
00:23:18,024 --> 00:23:22,050
问着  为什么要发生在我身上
Asking, why was all this happening to me?

343
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:25,020
找到答案了吗
Did you get an answer?

344
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:27,083
灯光亮起来  直射入空中
Light came on, shot up into the sky.

345
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:30,030
那时  我以为这有什么含义
At the time, I thought it meant something.

346
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:32,020
有吗
Did it?

347
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:34,096
没有  只是灯光
No. it was just a light.

348
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:37,063
你为什么带我们绕道
So why'd you turn us around then?

349
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:40,044
你不想回到那里吗
Don't you wanna go back there?

350
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:42,086
我干吗要那样做
Why would I wanna do that?

351
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,036
因此你就能说服自己做一些与众不同的事
So you could tell yourself to do things different,

352
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:47,086
脱离苦海
Save yourself a world of pain.

353
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:53,031
不  我需要这些痛苦来知道自己身处何地
No, I needed that pain to get to where I am now.

354
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,053
我刚刚流鼻血了
I just got a nosebleed.

355
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:08,026
什么  什么时候的事
What? when?

356
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:12,000
我们先别惊动到其他人  好吗
Let's just not freak out the others, okay?

357
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:14,020
告诉我
Just tell me...

358
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,073
-为什么她和我会这样  -我不知道
- Why--why her? why me? - I don't know.

359
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:18,073
我认为是和
Uh, I think it might have something to do

360
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:20,050
暴露在磁场的时间长短有关
With duration of exposure.

361
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:22,050
也就是你在岛上待的总时间
You know, the amount of time you've spent on the island.

362
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:24,033
这个解释说不通
Doesn't make any sense.

363
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:26,056
那群笨蛋已经在这里待了好几个月
Those yahoos have been here for months.

364
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:30,084
-我两个星期前才踏上这个岛的  -你确定吗
- I've never been here before two weeks ago. - Are you sure about that?

365
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:39,044
营地又回来了
The camp's back

366
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:40,097
总算到了
Finally.

367
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:44,041
有没有人想来瓶达摩啤酒
Anybody for a dharma beer?

368
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:46,074
有人吗  有人在吗
Hello? anybody here?

369
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:48,052
Rose  Bernard
Rose  Bernard

370
00:24:56,045 --> 00:25:00,012
我好奇这是什么时候发生的事情
I wonder how long ago this happened.

371
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:04,072
王八蛋
Son of a bitch!

372
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:09,007
这是什么
What is it?

373
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,087
是Vincent的
It's Vincent's.

374
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:13,054
是吗  那狗跑哪了
Yeah? well, where's the rest of the dog?

375
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:16,075
我们剩下的人哪去了
Where's the rest of our people?

376
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,084
Zodiac号也不见了
The Zodiac's gone, too.

377
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,004
也许你们其他的人把船开走了
Maybe your people took the boat.

378
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:25,091
到底为什么他们会那样做
Why the hell would they do that?

379
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,018
为了逃离乘这些玩意过来的人
To get away from whoever came in those.

380
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,075
这些玩意哪里来的
Where did these come from?

381
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:38,038
问得好
That's a good question.

382
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,001
看起来很古老
They're pretty old.

383
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:42,044
也没多古老
Not that old.

384
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:44,085
我看看
Let me see that.

385
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:48,084
"adg-uh-ruh"
adg-uh-ruh

386
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:50,051
Ajira  是个航空公司
Ajira. it's an airline.

387
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:52,083
是个印度航空公司  但飞往世界各地
It's based out of india, but they fly everywhere.

388
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,004
太好了,也许今晚他们有航班从这里飞往拉斯维加斯
Great. Maybe they got a flight out of here to vegas tonight.

389
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:57,081
乘这些船的是谁  还有其他人吗
-Who came in these? other others?

390
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,087
别看我
Don't look at me.

391
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:03,070
问题是  他们什么时候回来
My question is, when are they coming back?

392
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:06,044
我们别干等着  一起去搞清楚
Let's not wait to find out.

393
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:34,073
如果我们是开摩托艇
This plan sounded a hell of a lot better

394
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:37,033
这计划会感觉更好
When we were going by motorboat.

395
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:39,090
我们离那地方多远
How far is this place?

396
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:43,060
就在那个转角后头  就几个小时
It's around that point. not more than a couple hours.

397
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,001
噢  有意思了
Oh, joy.

398
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:52,040
你还好吗
You all right?

399
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:54,093
我看到Kate了
I saw Kate.

400
00:26:54,094 --> 00:26:55,085
什么
What?

401
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:58,097
昨晚  在丛林里
Last night, in the jungle.

402
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:01,072
在上次闪光出现之前
Before the last flash.

403
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:08,025
她正在帮Claire接生
She was delivering Claire's baby.

404
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,055
但那是两个月之前的事了
But that was two months ago.

405
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:15,027
穿越时间真不是玩意
Time travel's a bitch.

406
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:17,038
趴下
Get down!

407
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:26,075
-我想他们是要把船抢回来  -加把劲
- I think they want their boat back! - Move!

408
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:36,050
-他们和你一伙的吗  -不  是你们的人吗
- These your people?! - No! are they yours?!

409
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,035
闭嘴  继续划
Shut up and keeping paddling!

410
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:46,031
没用  没用
Little help! little help!

411
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:56,045
划快点  他们越来越靠近了
Paddle harder! they're getting closer!

412
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:05,065
感谢上帝
Thank you,lord!

413
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:16,047
我收回刚刚说的话
I take that back!

414
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:19,045
大家往岸边划
Everybody, paddle! head for the shore!

415
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:44,053
Kate  那家伙告诉你
Kate, just because the guy

416
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:46,090
他准备去见他的客户
Told you that he was meeting his client

417
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,013
不代表他们就在洛杉矶
Doesn't mean that they're here in l.a.

418
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,046
他可能只是这么说来  来打发你
He could've just told you that to--to throw you off.

419
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:52,047
或者是他们现在就在那个宾馆里头
Or they're in that hotel right now.

420
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:57,042
好吧  就算你说的是对的
Okay. and what if they are?

421
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:59,089
如果那个想夺走Aaron的人
What if the person who wants to take aaron

422
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,056
就坐在宾馆里
Is sitting in that hotel room right now?

423
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,079
又怎么样
Then what?

424
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,079
拜托  和我一起走
Come on. come with me.

425
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,079
我们先接走Aaron
We'll--we'll go get aaron,

426
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,079
然后再想办法
We'll put our heads together, and we'll figure something out.

427
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,063
好吧
All right.

428
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:23,060
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

429
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,070
是Claire的母亲
It's Claire's mother.

430
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:56,007
等等
Wait.

431
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:58,024
-我还等什么  Jack  -等等  我只是
- What am I waiting for, Jack? - Wait. I just...

432
00:29:58,025 --> 00:30:00,097
-我们先整理下头绪  -她知道了
- Let's just think about this for a minute. - She knows.

433
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,098
也许她还不知道
Maybe she doesn't know.

434
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:05,008
不  但她知道Aaron的存在  这就够要命的了
No, but she knows about aaron, and that's all that matters!

435
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:09,084
我去和她谈谈
Let me go talk to her.

436
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:11,007
什么
What?

437
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:13,097
如果我能向她解释清楚这么做的原因
If I can just explain to her why we did it--

438
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:17,020
也许我可能让她明白事情的缘由
Maybe if I can get her to understand why...

439
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:19,071
她会听我的
She'll listen to me.

440
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:24,068
我能处理好的  Kate  我会处理好的
I can fix this, kate. I can fix it.

441
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,038
Aaron也是我的家人
Aaron is my family, too.

442
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:06,000
Shephard医生
Dr. Shephard?

443
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:08,060
你好  Littleton女士
Hello, Ms. Littleton. um...

444
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:10,024
我能进来吗
May I come in?

445
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:11,088
当然
Of course.

446
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,094
你全身都淋湿了
You look drenched.

447
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:20,017
不  不  不  我没事
No, no. no, I'm fine.

448
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:23,021
天啊  自从你父亲的葬礼后我们就没再见过面
God, I haven't seen you since your father's funeral.

449
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:27,051
你怎么知道我在这的
How did you even know I was here?

450
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:31,077
我知道你在这里  Littleton女士
I knew you were here, Ms. Littleton,

451
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:34,090
是因为我跟踪了你的律师
Because I followed your lawyer.

452
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,050
你为什么要这样做
Why would you do that?

453
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:41,058
我这样做是因为
I'm--i did it because, um...

454
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:45,014
我理解你为什么想这样做
I understand that you feel the need to do this.

455
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,014
但是我希望你能明白
But I need you to know

456
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:51,062
我和Kate做的一切事情  都是为了Aaron
That everything that kate and I have done--it was for aaron.

457
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:57,092
谁是Aaron
Who's... Aaron?

458
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:03,074
我恐怕不是很明白你在说什么
I-i'm afraid I'm not following you.

459
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:05,097
littleton女士
Ms. littleton, um...

460
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:08,082
你在洛杉矶干什么
What are you doing here in los angeles?

461
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:19,054
走  开车  给sun打电话
Let's go. drive. then call sun

462
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:22,001
告诉她把Aaron带到长滩码头
And tell her to bring aaron to the long beach marina.

463
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:23,075
你在说什么  发生什么了
what--wh-what are you talking about? what happened?

464
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,075
Kate我们现在必须要走了
Kate, we have to go now.

465
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:27,041
我哪儿也不去  除非你告诉我发生什么事了
I'm not going anywhere until yo tell me what just happened!

466
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:29,041
她什么都不知道
She doesn't know anything.

467
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,064
什么
What?

468
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:33,084
她不知道
She doesn't know.

469
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:37,047
她一直以为Claire已经死了
She still thinks that claire is dead.

470
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:40,001
她甚至也不知道Aaron的存在
She doesn't even know that aaron exists.

471
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:42,074
-但律师  -她起诉了大洋航空
-But the lawyer-- -she sued oceanic,

472
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:44,033
她来城里打点行装
And she's in town to pick up her settlement.

473
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:46,024
如果她的律师和要带走我儿子的人
What, and it's just a coincidence that her lawyer

474
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:48,067
碰巧是同一个人呢
Happens to be the same one that's trying to take my son?

475
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,071
我不知道
I don't know.

476
00:32:49,072 --> 00:32:53,004
但不管是谁想带走Aaron
But whoever's trying to take aaron...

477
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,071
绝对不会是她
It's not her.

478
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,082
那是谁呢
Then who is it?

479
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:05,052
我可以问你些问题吗
Can I ask you something?

480
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:09,041
你为什么救Hugo呢
Why'd you take it upon yourself to rescue hugo?

481
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:12,024
我必须要确保Hurley的安全
I had to make sure hurley was safe.

482
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:15,058
你可以在这边停车
You can pull in over here.

483
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:41,097
Linus先生
Mr. linus.

484
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:43,074
Norton先生
Mr. norton.

485
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,074
我调查过了
I looked into it,

486
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:48,087
他们没什么针对Reyes的具体案件
And they don't have any kind of solid case against reyes.

487
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:51,084
法医称在Santa Rosa外发现的那个男人
The m.e. said that the man found outside santa rosa

488
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:53,081
在Reyes逃跑前已被杀害
Was killed before reyes escaped.

489
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:55,077
这真是个好消息
That's very good news.

490
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:57,074
我们今天上午有个预备听证会
We have a prelim hearing in the morning.

491
00:33:57,075 --> 00:34:00,011
法官不会让这通过的
The judge will never let it get past that,

492
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:02,007
Reyes会无罪释放的
And reyes will be a free man.

493
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:04,044
Dan  谢谢你
Thank you, dan.

494
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:06,085
不客气
Anytime.

495
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:14,097
他是谁
Who was that?

496
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:17,022
那是我的律师
That's my lawyer.

497
00:34:20,088 --> 00:34:23,015
好了
Aah! okay!

498
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:29,092
别让我再做这样的事了
Remind me never to do that again.

499
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:35,082
-我们在哪  -天亮前说不清
-Where are we? -it's hard to say till it gets light.

500
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:49,084
我们还没机会把上次的话说完
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation.

501
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:52,031
什么谈话
What conversation was that?

502
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,081
他们开始射杀我们前的谈话
The one before they started shooting at us,

503
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:58,077
你准备告诉我再次见到kate的感受
Where you were about to tell me how it felt to see kate again.

504
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:01,052
我没打算告诉你什么
I wasn't about to tell you anything.

505
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:05,042
为什么现在不告诉我呢
Why don't you tell me now?

506
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,008
我都可以碰到她了
I was close enough to touch her.

507
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,081
如果我想做  我本可以
If I wanted to, I could've...

508
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:34,095
站出来和她说话的
Stood right up and talked to her.

509
00:35:36,012 --> 00:35:38,038
为什么不呢
Why didn't you?

510
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:44,072
反正事情都已经发生了
What's done is done.

511
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:56,022
怎么了
What's wrong?

512
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:07,052
过来看看这个
Come and look at this!

513
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:16,034
这是些残骸
It's wreckage.

514
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:18,065
像才坠毁的样子
Looks like it just happened.

515
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:31,015
有人会说法语吗
Anybody speak french?

516
00:38:06,055 --> 00:38:09,018
Jack  干嘛今天打电话给我
Jack, why did you call me today?

517
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:12,097
我跟你说过了
I told you. I s...

518
00:38:12,098 --> 00:38:15,001
我很担心
I was worried.

519
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:17,078
为什么你要担心  为什么是今天
But why? why were you worried? why today?

520
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:29,071
我不
I don't...

521
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:32,001
我打给你之前  Sayid被人袭击了
Right before I called you, sayid was attacked.

522
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:35,074
那人的口袋里有你的地址
And the guy that did it-- your address was in his pocket.

523
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:38,037
Sayid  他在这做什么
Sayid? what's he doing here?

524
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:40,034
这些现在不重要了
That's not important right now.

525
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:44,027
重要的是我们把你和Aaron转移到安全的地方
What matters is that we get you and aaron someplace safe.

526
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:47,022
躲谁
Safe from who?

527
00:39:00,078 --> 00:39:03,012
Kate
Hello, kate.

528
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:13,055
没事的  他和我一起的
It's okay. he's with me.

529
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:16,061
他和你是一起的吗
He's with you?

530
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,001
我知道这很难解释
I know this is gonna be hard to understand,

531
00:39:19,002 --> 00:39:21,035
但他是来帮助我们的
But he's here to help us.

532
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:25,094
来帮助我们丢下的每一个人
To help everyone that we left behind.

533
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:29,021
-我们得再次集合起来  -是他
- We all need to be together again. - it's him.

534
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:31,004
什么
What?

535
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:35,014
他就是想抢走Aaron的人
It's him. he's the one who's trying to take aaron.

536
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:38,064
-不  你不明白  -不  Jack  她是对的
- No. no. you-- you don't understand. - no, jack. she's right.

537
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:40,045
是我
It was me.

538
00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:44,084
对不起
Sorry.

539
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:47,041
你以为你是谁
Who the hell do you think you are?

540
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:49,041
为什么你就不能滚远点
Why don't you just stay away?!

541
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:51,037
为什么你就不能放过我们母子
Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!

542
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:54,058
因为他不是你儿子  Kate
Because he's not your son, kate.

543
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:34,067
4  8  Robert
4  8  Robert

544
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:36,055
15  16

545
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:48,023
听不懂
No understand.

546
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:49,070
你会说英语
You speak english?

547
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,090
一点点
Little.

548
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:55,013
你还好吧
Are you okay?

549
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:56,080
还好
Yes.

550
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:59,048
你怎么来到这儿的
How did you get here?

551
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:03,044
-船  -坐什么[法语]
- Boat. - qui est-ce?

552
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:08,084
什么船
What boat?

553
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,023
消失了
It's gone.

554
00:41:13,024 --> 00:41:14,057
沉了
Sink.

555
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:17,017
肯定是风暴引起的  就跟我们一样
It must've been caught in the same storm as ours.

556
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:20,091
你是谁  你在水里多长时间了
Who are you? how long you in the water?

557
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:23,057
我不知道  你怎么会不知道
I don't know. how do you not know

558
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:26,057
那你怎么会漂浮在海中央的
