00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,021
《迷失》前情提要
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:12,060
-那是Benjamin Linus吗  -我们要你救他
- Is that Benjamin Linus? - We need you to save his life.

3
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:15,077
如果我把他带走  他就会改头换面
If I take him, he's not ever gonna be the same again.

4
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,044
永远成为我们的一员
He will always be one of us.

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:22,044
赶紧给我滚出来  不然我毙了你女儿
Get your ass out here right now, or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,013
她是我从一个疯女人那里偷来的
I stole her as a baby from an insane woman.

7
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:27,065
我根本不在乎她  所以如果你想杀她
She means nothing to me. so if you want to kill her,

8
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:29,019
尽管动手吧
Go ahead and do it...

9
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:31,006
这个人很危险
This guy is dangerous.

10
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:34,014
Sun  我来这里所乘的船上全是突击队
Sun, that boat I came here on was filled with commandos

11
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:36,064
他们的唯一使命就是抓到他
Whose only mission was to get him.

12
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:39,056
看看后来怎么了
And how'd that work out for everyone?

13
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:44,053
-你认识他吗  -认识
- You know him? - Yeah.

14
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:49,074
他就是杀我的凶手
He's the man who killed me.

15
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:16,058
-你都做了什么  Richard  -镇定
- What have you done, Richard? - Calm down

16
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:18,054
-镇定  这件事与你无关  -那就是真的
- Calm down. this has nothing to do with you. - So it's true?

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,081
你真的把他们的成员带到我们神殿
You actually brought one of them to our temple?

18
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,053
他只是个孩子  而且生命垂危
He's just a boy, and he was dying.

19
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,042
那就顺其自然
Then you should've let him die.

20
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,030
Jacob想让我救他
Jacob wanted it done.

21
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,023
这座岛的选择不容抗辩
The island chooses is the island's chooses.

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,035
你也知道
You know that.

23
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:37,080
对  对  那是当然
Yes. yes, of course.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,084
他叫什么名字
What's his name?

25
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:04,025
你好  Benjamin
Hello, Benjamin.

26
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:07,044
发生了什么事
What happened?

27
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:10,057
你受伤了
You were injured.

28
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:12,011
怎么会
How?

29
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:14,054
你不记得了吗
You don't remember?

30
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:16,062
我现在哪里
Where am i?

31
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,003
你和朋友们在一起
You're among friends.

32
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,061
我们会照顾你
We're going to take care of you.

33
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:23,090
我爸呢  他在吗
My dad...is he here?

34
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:25,047
你很快就能回到他身边
You'll be back to him soon enough.

35
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:28,056
不  不  我不想回去
No. no, I don't want to go back.

36
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:30,065
好  放松  放松
Okay, easy. easy. oh!

37
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:34,054
我不想回去
I don't want to go back.

38
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:40,033
我想留下
I wanna stay.

39
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,039
我想加入你们
I wanna be one of you.

40
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:45,080
你和他们同住在一起
Just because you're living with them

41
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:47,099
不代表你就不能成为我们一员
Doesn't mean you can't be one of us.

42
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:50,011
你本该已经死了  Benjamin
You should be dead, Benjamin.

43
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:52,062
可这座岛
But this island...

44
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:54,035
救了你的命
It saved your life.

45
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:59,056
你是谁
Who are you?

46
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:03,000
我叫Charles
I'm Charles.

47
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:05,068
Charles Widmore
Charles widmore.

48
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,026
Ben
Ben.

49
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:24,094
你好  Ben
Hello, Ben.

50
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:28,001
欢迎回到人间
Welcome back to the land of the living.

51
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:34,009
天呐
My god.

52
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,044
你还活着
You're alive.

53
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:37,060
没错
Yes, I am.

54
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:42,050
我就知道
I knew it.

55
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,045
我就知道会这样
I knew that this would happen.

56
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:49,013
那你为什么见到我还那么惊讶
Then why are you so surprised to see me?

57
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:53,097
John  因为相信是一回事
Because it's one thing to believe it, John.

58
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:56,068
亲眼验证又是另一回事
It's another thing to see it.

59
00:03:56,076 --> 00:04:00,072
那你为什么还想方设法逃到主岛上
Then why were you trying to run away to the main island?

60
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,050
John  我打破了规则
I broke the rules,John.

61
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:06,097
回到了岛上
I came back to the island.

62
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:10,013
我当时想为我的所作所为负责
I was going to answer for what I'd done.

63
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:12,086
我当时正要回去
I was going back...

64
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:15,022
接收审判
To be judged.

65
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:21,044
审判
Judged?

66
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:26,007
谁审判
By whom?

67
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:28,015
John
Well, j-john,

68
00:04:28,022 --> 00:04:31,097
它还没有名字
We don't even have a word for it,

69
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:35,035
可我相信  你会叫它"怪物"
But I believe you call it the monster.

早啊
Morning.

79
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,045
你好
Hello.

80
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:10,007
箱子里装的什么
What's in the crate?

81
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,065
只是些行动必备的行装
Just some stuff we need to get moved.

82
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:14,053
要帮忙吗
Need a hand?

83
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,010
谢谢  不用了
Oh, thanks. we got it.

84
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:21,027
好  万事顺意
Okay. have a great day.

85
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:35,063
朋友  你感觉怎样
How you feeling, my friend?

86
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,015
就像有人用桨敲了我  可我还活着
Like someone hit me with an oar, but I'll live.

87
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:44,008
-你觉得他这人怎样  -不好说
- What do you make of him? - I'm not sure.

88
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,070
他对你说了什么
What has he told you?

89
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:52,073
你失去直觉时  他一直照看着你
When you were out cold, he was watching over you.

90
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,079
他说你杀了他
And he said you killed him.

91
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:57,077
我杀了他
I killed him?

92
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:00,038
真的吗  可我看他现在好好的
Really? 'cause he looks fine to me.

93
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:10,050
我不记得他是飞机上的乘客
You know, I don't really remember him from the plane.

94
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:12,097
-你记得他吗  -不  我不记得了
- Do you? - No, I don't.

95
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,074
要是
What if...

96
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:22,015
我们坠机前  他就已经在这里了呢
He was already here, before we crashed?

97
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:24,075
如果他认为我杀了他  那他就是疯子
If he thinks I killed him, then he's insane.

98
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:28,047
我们可能在和精神错乱的人打交道
We may be dealing with a man who's dangerously deranged.

99
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,029
那问题就是  我们该怎样应付呢
Then the question is, what are we gonna do about it?

100
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:35,039
别担心  朋友
Don't worry, my friend.

101
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:40,042
我支持你
I have your back.

102
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:44,092
我叫Caesar
Caesar.

103
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:47,087
很高兴认识你  Ceasar  我叫Ben
Pleasure to meet you, Caesar. I'm Ben.

104
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:08,056
要我动手吗
You want me to do it?

105
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,074
只要你开口  我就动手  Ben
I can do it if you want me to, ben.

106
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:15,072
闭嘴
Shut up!

107
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,012
乖乖呆在这里  Ethan
And stay here, Ethan.

108
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,080
别  别这样
Don't! don't do it.

109
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:04,017
你就是让我们受感染的人  对吗
You're the one who infected us, aren't you?!

110
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:13,076
不  （法语）

111
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,091
不
No! shh.

112
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:19,092
-别带走我孩子（法语）  -没事的  没事的
- Donnez... -It's okay. it's okay, baby.

113
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:26,045
求你了  别带走我的Alex
Please, don't take my Alex!

114
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:29,017
还想让你孩子活命吗
Do you want your baby to live?

115
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:31,049
为什么要带走她
Why are you taking her?!

116
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:37,033
感谢上苍你还活着吧
Be grateful you're still alive.

117
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,098
你给我听着
Now you listen to me.

118
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:42,021
如果你跟踪我  或者来找我
If you try to follow me or if you ever come looking for me,

119
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:44,030
我就杀了你
I'll kill you.

120
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,090
如果你还想保住你孩子的命
And if you want your child to live,

121
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:49,093
只要你听到低声细语  就往另一边跑
Every time you hear whispers, you run the other way.

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,074
那是什么
What's that?

123
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,015
一些让人伤感的东西
Just something sentimental.

124
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:38,049
这就是你的旧办公室
So this is your old office, huh?

125
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:43,046
我从没想过你会在坐在办公桌前
I never pictured you leading your people

126
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,055
领导你的人
From behind a desk.

127
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:48,072
这有点像
It seems a little...

128
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:50,066
公司
Corporate.

129
00:09:58,006 --> 00:10:00,099
-你想要什么吗  John  -Ben  我希望
- Was there something that you needed, John? - Well, Ben, I was hoping

130
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:04,022
能聊聊你我都心知肚明  却闭口不谈的事
That you and I could talk about the elephant in the room.

131
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,036
我想你指的是我杀你那件事吧
I assume you're referring to the fact that I killed you.

132
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:11,076
对
Yeah.

133
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,062
那是让你回到岛上的唯一办法
It was the only way to get you back to the island,

134
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,079
还有那些离开的人
Along with as many of those who left as possible.

135
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:26,085
你应该记得  所以你才率先离开
You do remember, John...that's why you left in the first place,

136
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,087
去说服他们回来
To convince 'em to come back?

137
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,061
可事与愿违
But you failed.

138
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:34,018
唯一能把他们聚到一起的方法
And the only way to bring them together

139
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,026
就是你死  你自己也明白这点
Was by your death, and you understood that.

140
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:39,005
这就是当你自杀时我要阻止的原因
It's why you were about to kill yourself when i stopped you.

141
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,056
如果真的要我死  Ben  你为什么阻止我
If all i had to do was die, Ben, then why did you stop me?

142
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:44,065
因为你拥有一些重要的信息
You had critical information that would've died with you.

143
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:47,030
一旦你给了我
And once you'd given it to me...

144
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,086
我当时没有时间
Well, i just didn't have time

145
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:55,046
去劝你再次把你自己吊死
To talk you back into hanging yourself.

146
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,035
所以我走了捷径
So i took a shortcut.

147
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,065
你看现在的你  John  我当时是对的
And look at you, John. i was right.

148
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:04,071
你回来了  还有其他的人
You're here. you're back. so are the rest of them.

149
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:08,036
虽然不知道在哪里  但是也一起回来了
I don't know where yet exactly, but they came. it worked.

150
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:16,076
这才是我当时杀你的原因
And that's why i did it,

151
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:19,086
因只有这样才能符合这座岛的利益
Because it was in the best interests of the island.

152
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,051
我一直等你道歉呢
I was just hoping for an apology.

153
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:33,077
我决定助你一臂之力  Ben
I've decided to help you, Ben.

154
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:37,004
帮助我做什么
Help me do what?

155
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:40,048
帮助你完成你未完成的事
Do what you say you are on your way to do.

156
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:42,040
接收审判
Be judged.

157
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:43,075
后果会不堪设想  John  
That's not something you want to see, John.

158
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,033
如果你所做的一切
If everything you've done

159
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,088
都是为了这座岛的利益
Has been in the best interests of the island...

160
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:54,070
那么我保证那怪物会理解的
Then i'm sure the monster will understand.

161
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:01,069
走吧
Let's go.

162
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,045
-你们在做什么  -我们要用这条船
- What are you doing? - We're taking a boat.

163
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:17,082
去哪里
Where?

164
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,008
去对面的主岛
Over to the main island.

165
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:22,096
我可不那么想  朋友
I don't think so, my friend.

166
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,091
这些是你的船吗
Are these your boats?

167
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:27,069
难道是你的吗
Are they yours?

168
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:29,091
你叫Caesar  是吗
Caesar, right?

169
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,052
我记得这些船是在这里被发现的
I was under the impression these were found here

170
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:33,010
所以我想借一条船
So i'm just gonna borrow one.

171
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,045
我很愿意把剩下的船留给你们
I'm happy to leave the other boat for you

172
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:38,069
-你们也可以跟着我们  -"我们"
- In case you want to follow us.   - "us"?

173
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:40,043
你要和他一起吗
Are you going with him?

174
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,000
他都没有给我选择的余地
He didn't really give me a choice.

175
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,095
不好意思  但是这里我说的算
I'm sorry, but i'm calling the shots here

176
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,024
你不能拿走任何东西
And i say you are not taking anything.

177
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,037
你所需要做得就是坐下来
What you are going to do is to sit down

178
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:56,094
告诉我们你怎么知道的那么多
And tell us how you know so much

179
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:59,021
关于这座岛的事情
about this island you mean it.my friend

180
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:05,004
你习惯把别人称做"朋友"
You're in the habit of calling people "friend,"

181
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:07,009
但我不认为你当真的
But i don't think you mean it.

182
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:08,079
-离船远一点  -不
-Step away from the boat.  -no. i'm

183
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,053
我绝不会离开这条船
not gonna step awe the boats

184
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,062
我要把它带走  希望你能同意  朋友
I'm gonna take it, and you're gonna let me, my friend.

185
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:13,094
你什么都别想拿走
You're not taking anything.

186
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:14,098
你在找这个吗
you looking for this?

187
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:27,018
先生们  我把这条船带走了
This gentleman and i are taking a boat.

188
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:30,034
还有谁有异议吗
Does anyone else have a problem with that?

189
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:45,012
算是我的道歉吧
Consider that my apology.

190
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,014
家  温馨的家
Home, sweet home.

191
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,066
看来我们不是最早
Looks like we're not the first

192
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,029
决定来这里的人
ones who decided to tie up here

193
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,033
一定是Sun和Lapidus
That would be Sun and Lapidus.

194
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,094
我告诉他们船的位置
I showed 'em where the boats were,

195
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:29,004
Sun用船桨把我打晕  表达对我的感激之情
And Sun thanked me by smashing me on the head with a paddle.

196
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:31,099
她是那个把你手弄伤的人
Oh. is she the one that hurt your arm?

197
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:35,089
我注意到  你一路上都很小心  不碰上手臂
I noticed you were favoring it on the way over.

198
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:38,074
不是
No.

199
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:40,082
是其他人把我的手弄伤了
Someone else hurt my arm.

200
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:44,086
不管到哪里你都不断的结交朋友  是把
You just make friends everywhere you go, don't ya?

201
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,046
有时候我发现朋友可以
Well, i've found sometimes that friends can be

202
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,080
比敌人还要危险  John
Significantly more dangerous than enemies, John.

203
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:54,003
这就是为什么你要杀那个手无寸铁的人吗
Is that why you shot an unarmed man in the chest?

204
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,085
那个人手无寸铁是因为我偷了他的枪
The man was unarmed because i'd stolen his gun...

205
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:59,093
他打算用那枪杀了你
The gun he was going to use to kill you.

206
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:03,018
我再死一次也不要紧  是把
No sense in me dying twice, right?

207
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,058
不客气
You're welcome.

208
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:10,017
我们现在去你的老房子是吧
We're going to your old house, aren't we?

209
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:11,086
是的
Yes.

210
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:14,078
唯一我可以召唤它的地方
It's the only place i can summon it...

211
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:16,074
那个"怪物"
The "monster."

212
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,070
等它来了  它要不宽恕我
Once it arrives, i'll either be forgiven...

213
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,093
要不处置我
Or i won't.

214
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:27,027
我感觉你在说谎
I think you're lying.

215
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:29,019
说什么谎
Lying about what?

216
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:32,027
你想因为离开岛而接收审判
That you want to be judged for leaving the island

217
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:34,082
现在回来是因为你坏了规矩
And coming back because it's against the rules.

218
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:36,078
我不觉得你关心规矩
I don't think you care about rules.

219
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,030
那我因为什么要接受审判  John  
Then what do i want to be judged for, John?

220
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:41,059
因为你杀了你的女儿
For killing your daughter.

221
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:09,040
你下手了吗
Did you do it?

222
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,062
事情...
We had a...

223
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,037
有些复杂
Complication.

224
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:19,064
那是一个婴儿吗
I'm sorry. is that a... baby?

225
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,095
你的命令是去杀了那女的
Your orders were to exterminate that woman.

226
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:28,016
为什么  Charles  她没有威胁到我们  她疯了
Why? she's no threat to us. she's insane, Charles.

227
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:31,025
而且你没有告诉我她有个小孩
Besides, you didn't tell me she had a child.

228
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,000
那你觉得我该怎么做
What was it i was supposed to do?

229
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,033
杀了它
Kill it.

230
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,059
这不是动物  而是个婴儿
It's not an "it." this is a child.

231
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,029
你会发现这有些难以理解  Benjamin  
You might find this difficult to understand, Benjamin...

232
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:49,068
我做的每一个决定都是
Every decision i've made has been about

233
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,049
为了保护这座岛
Protecting this island.

234
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:53,099
Jacob真的想杀了这个婴儿吗
Is killing this baby what Jacob wants?

235
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:05,087
给你
Then here she is.

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,005
你来动手
You do it.

237
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:56,011
搬来这里是谁的主意
So whose idea was it to move into these houses?

238
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:57,084
你说什么
Excuse me?

239
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:59,092
你们原来都住在丛林里
Well, your people were living in the jungle.

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,098
然后你把达摩组织的人都杀了
And then after you murdered the Dharma folk,

241
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,072
你们搬到了这里
You relocated here.

242
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:06,036
我想知道这是不是你的主意
I just wondered if it was your idea.

243
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,038
你不赞成这样吗  John
Do you disapprove, John?

244
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,073
好像并不是这个岛的意思
It just doesn't seem like something the island would want.

245
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,079
你不知道这个岛的初衷是什么
You don't have the first idea what this island wants.

246
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,028
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

247
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,097
那是你的房子吗
That was your house, wasn't it?

248
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,002
是的  那个是Alex的房间
Yes, and that's Alex's room.

249
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,098
我建议你最好进去看看
Well, i suppose you better go over there and check it out.

250
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:25,085
Sun
Sun?

251
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,045
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

252
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,054
这以前是我的房子  我看到灯亮着
This used to be my house. i saw a light turned on.

253
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:36,054
你们两个在这里做什么
What are the two of you doing in here?

254
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,026
-这个是1977年照的  -你想说...
- That was taken in 1977.  - Are you trying to tell me

255
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,073
你的朋友加入了达摩组织
That your friends were in the Dharma initiative?

256
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:52,016
你不知道这个吗
You don't know about this?

257
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:54,018
当然不知道
Of course not.

258
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,052
你从哪里拿个照片  谁给你的
Where did you get this? who gave this to you?

259
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,075
我们在外面遇到个老疯子
We met some crazy old man outside.

260
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:03,025
他说他的名字叫Christian
He said his name was Christian.

261
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:06,046
-他告诉我们来这里等着  -等什么
- He told us to come in here and wait. - Wait for what?

262
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:08,013
他说如果我还想见到我的丈夫的话
He said if i ever wanted to see my husband again,

263
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:10,053
我就需要等John Locke
I had to wait here for John locke.

264
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:14,084
但是一想到他已经死了  我们就伤心欲绝
But considering he's dead, we ain't holding our breath.

265
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:18,021
你应该往窗外看看
Well, you might want to look outside.

266
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:43,056
你所说的都
What you're saying, it's...

267
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:44,092
不可能
Impossible.

268
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:47,042
但是我确实在这
But here I am.

269
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:50,024
我不知道怎么来的  也不知道为什么
I don't know how, I don't know why,

270
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,057
但是我知道这肯定有原因
But I'm sure there's a very good reason for it.

271
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:54,039
既然那个死人说有原因
As long as the dead guy says there's a reason,

272
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,024
我想所有的事肯定会有合理解释的
Well, then I guess everything's gonna be just peachy.

273
00:20:57,031 --> 00:21:01,031
大家伙... 他们都是30年前的人
And forget about the fact that the rest of your people Are supposedly 30 years ago...

274
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,036
现在唯一能帮我们的
Now the only ones who are here to help us

275
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:05,086
是一个杀手和一个不记得
Are a murderer and a guy who can't seem to remember

276
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:07,099
怎么从棺材中爬出来的人
How the hell he got out of a coffin.

277
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:11,003
Sun  回到计划上来吧
Sun, please, let's just go back to the plane,

278
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,030
我试试能不能修好收音机   或许能有帮助
See if I can fix the radio, and maybe we can get some help.

279
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,040
如果你和他走 
If you leave with him,

280
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,038
就会永远也找不到你丈夫了
you'll never find your husband again.

281
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:26,011
我是唯一能帮你的人
I'm all the help you need.

282
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,038
你是说你知道怎么找到他们
Are you saying you know how to find them?

283
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:30,011
怎么找到找到Jin
How to find Jin?

284
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:31,061
我有个主意
I have some ideas.

285
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:33,087
我很遗憾
I'm sorry to say,

286
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:36,013
看来我们不能一起离开了
But I'm leaving with or without you.

287
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,085
只要有一线希望能找到我的丈夫
If there's any chance of finding my husband,

288
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,010
我就会留下来
Then I have to stay.

289
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:44,078
好吧
All right.

290
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:50,080
上天保佑  小心些
For god sake, watch your back.

291
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:01,079
好了
All right.

292
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:04,036
我们怎么能找到Jin
How do we find Jin?

293
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:07,097
Ben要先做些事  是吧  Ben
Ben has something to do first. isn't that right, Ben?

294
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:12,059
是的John  没错
Yes, John. That's right.

295
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:15,045
那我们就开始吧
Better get to it then.

296
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:59,058
我要出去了
I'll be outside.

297
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,016
再来  爸爸
Again, daddy! again!

298
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:10,021
好的 Alex
Okay. okay. wow, Alex!

299
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:13,030
再高些  我们就要飞上天了
Any higher, and you're gonna fly right off the island.

300
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:20,018
潜艇要出发了
The sub's about to leave.

301
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:22,094
再高些  爸爸
Higher, daddy! higher!

302
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,053
好的
All right.

303
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,079
你不一定非要送他  Ben
You don't have to see him off, Ben.

304
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:29,040
不  Richard   我要送他
Yes, Richard, I do.

305
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:31,059
高些  再高些  爸爸
Higher! higher, daddy!

306
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,045
Charles
Charles!

307
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,026
我是来说再见的
I came to say good-bye.

308
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:49,046
不  你是在幸灾乐祸
No, you didn't. you came to gloat.

309
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,070
不  我也不想这样
No, don't act as if I wanted this.

310
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:52,089
是你自食其果
You brought this on yourself.

311
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:55,003
你确定要这么做吗  Benjamin
Are you quite certain you want to do this, benjamin?

312
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:58,047
你经常离开小岛  你的女儿...
You left the island regularly. you had a daughter

313
00:24:58,055 --> 00:25:01,005
和外面的人相好  Charles
With an outsider. you broke the rules, charles.

314
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:03,036
你凭什么认为你可以得到我的东西
And what makes you think you deserve to take what's mine?

315
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:05,052
因为我不想那么自私
Because I won't be selfish.

316
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,075
因为我将不惜一切保护这个小岛
Because I'll sacrifice anything to protect this island.

317
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,050
你才不会不惜一切  Alex
You wouldn't sacrifice alex.

318
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:13,062
你想让她死  Charles
You're the one who wanted her dead, charles,

319
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,081
而不是小岛
Not the island.

320
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:20,009
希望你是对的  Benjamin
I hope you're right, benjamin,

321
00:25:20,016 --> 00:25:21,062
因为如果你错了
Because if you aren't,

322
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:24,075
那就是这个小岛想让她死
And it is the island that wants her dead,

323
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:26,042
她就死定了
She'll be dead.

324
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:30,084
有一天  你会跟我一样站在这
And one day, you'll be standing where I'm standing now.

325
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,027
被驱逐出去
You'll be the one being banished,

326
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,032
你会意识到
And then you'll finally realize

327
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,045
你根本无法改变必然发生的事
That you cannot fight the inevitable.

328
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:45,008
走着瞧  伙计
I'll be seeing you, boy.

329
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:08,052
John去哪了
Where did john go?

330
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:10,057
他说要处理些事
He said he had something to do.

331
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:13,074
他去干吗了
Did he say what it was?

332
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,017
我没问
No, I didn't ask.

333
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,080
Jack肯定在撒谎
Jack must have lied.

334
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:23,041
- 什么  - Locke真的死了吗
Excuse me? about locke being dead?

335
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,085
我不知道他为什么撒谎  不过这是唯一的解释
I don't know why he would, but that's the only explanation.

336
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:30,097
Jack没有撒谎  John确实死了
Jack didn't lie. john was dead.

337
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:34,028
不意味着他伪装了自己的死亡
Doesn't mean that he couldn't have faked his dea...

338
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:36,002
相信我  他真的死了
Trust me. I'm sure.

339
00:26:41,062 --> 00:26:44,050
所以你知道如果我们回去的话
So you knew this would happen to locke

340
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:47,084
这一切也会发生在Locke身上
If we brought him back here?

341
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:52,018
Sun  我不知道会发生这些
Sun, I had no idea it would happen.

342
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:53,079
我看到了小岛上发生的奇事
I've seen this island do miraculous things.

343
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:56,037
我看到它治愈了疾病
I've seen it heal the sick,

344
00:26:56,043 --> 00:26:59,021
但都不像这件事
But never once has it done anything like this.

345
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,002
死了就死了
Dead is dead.

346
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:07,059
死了就不能复生了
You don't get to come back from that,

347
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,071
在这儿也不行
Not even here.

348
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:15,009
当John Locke出现在小岛上
So the fact that john locke is walking around this island...

349
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:18,019
我被吓的魂飞魄散
Scares the living hell out of me.

350
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,018
你该进去了
You may want to go inside.

351
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,086
为什么
Why?

352
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:38,035
因为树丛里有我不能控制的东西
Because what's about to come out of that jungle is something I can't control.

353
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,083
怎么样了
Any luck?

354
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:49,093
还没出现
It hasn't shown up yet.

355
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,024
上次我们没等这么久
Last time we didn't have to wait this long.

356
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,087
这不是火车  John  不是按时刻表来的
It's not a train, john. it doesn't run on a schedule.

357
00:27:55,095 --> 00:28:00,043
好吧  如果它不出现  那...
Well, if it's not gonna come to us, then...

358
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,004
我想我们就只能自己找它了
I suppose we'll have to go to it.

359
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,054
它不是这么工作的  我只知道怎么召唤它
It doesn't work that way. I only know how to summon it.

360
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,063
我并不知道它究竟在哪
I don't know where it actually is.

361
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:12,035
我知道
I do.

362
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:26,041
我也觉得很不可思议
It's weird for me, too.

363
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:28,005
什么
Excuse me?

364
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:32,023
我知道这奇怪...
I realize how strange this all is...

365
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,053
我出现在这
Me, here.

366
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,069
但是我像你保证  Sun
But I assure you, sun,

367
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:41,016
我跟过去的我是同一个人
I'm the same man I've always been.

368
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:45,058
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

369
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:47,091
带路吧
Lead the way.

370
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:58,074
喂
Hello?

371
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,031
Charles  我是Benjanmin
Charles? it's Benjamin.

372
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,049
你怎么知道这个号码的
How did you get this number?

373
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:06,000
这并不重要  重要的是
Doesn't matter. what matters is

374
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:08,016
我今天要返回小岛上
I'm going back to the island today.

375
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:11,015
小岛不会让你回去的  相信我
The island won't let you come back, trust me.

376
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:12,058
我花了20年的时间企图回去
I've spent almost 20 years trying to return.

377
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:17,055
Charles  你失败了  但是我会成功的
Well, charles, where you failed, I'm going to succeed...

378
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:20,033
只要我做一件事
Just as soon as I do one thing.

379
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,062
什么事  Benjamin
And what's that, benjamin?

380
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,029
杀了你的女儿
Kill your daughter.

381
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:31,014
事实上  我现在正看着我们共同的朋友
In fact, I'm looking at "our mutual friend" right now.

382
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,094
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

383
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:37,022
-Penny在的船的名字就是吧  -你敢
- It's the name of the boat that penny's on. - Don't you dare.

384
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:39,062
再见  Charles
Good-bye, Charles.

385
00:29:50,003 --> 00:29:52,033
我能问你一个问题吗  John
May I ask you a question, John?

386
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,010
说
Shoot.

387
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:57,026
你怎么知道你要去哪
How is it that you know where you're going?

388
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,089
我是说  这具体怎么办到的
I mean, how does that work, exactly?

389
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:02,045
怎么回事
How does what work?

390
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:04,082
你知道的那些  我是说它是逐渐的
The knowing. I mean, did it come upon you gradually,

391
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:06,087
还是某一天
Or did you wake up one morning

392
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:08,096
突然出现在你的脑子里的
Suddenly understanding the mysteries of the universe?

393
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:11,091
-你不喜欢这些  对吗  -什么
- You don't like this, do you? - What?

394
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:13,061
无奈地提些
Having to ask questions

395
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:15,070
你自己都不知道答案的问题
That you don't know the answers to,

396
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:17,075
盲目地相信别人
Blindly following someone in the hopes that

397
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:22,010
希望他们能带你找到你要的东西
They'll lead you to whatever it is you're looking for.

398
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:24,039
不  John  我一点也不喜欢
No, John, I don't like it at all.

399
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:30,044
现在你知道我是怎样的人了吧
Well, now you know what it was like to be me.

400
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:36,052
我们得继续赶路
We should keep moving.

401
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:41,063
是的
Yes, we should.

402
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,033
我知道我们要去哪  John
I think I know where we're going now, John.

403
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,045
是吗
Do you?

404
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:53,048
我小时候他们带我去的地方
It's the same place they brought me as a child.

405
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:56,043
我被治愈的地方
It's where the island healed me.

406
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:04,018
但愿这次它也能大发慈悲
Let's hope it's as generous this time around.

407
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,016
那是什么
What is it?

408
00:31:13,023 --> 00:31:15,045
神殿的围墙
It's the wall around our temple.

409
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,097
什么神殿
What temple?

410
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:22,034
离这一英里远
About a half mile from here.

411
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:27,021
围墙是防止你们这样的人看见神殿的
We built this wall to keep people like the two of you from ever seeing it.

412
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:35,028
我们不去你们的神殿  Ben
We're not going into your temple, Ben.

413
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:46,002
我们从下面进入
We're going under it.

414
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:58,090
你先进去
After you.

415
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:08,009
请你帮个忙  Sun
I need to ask a favor of you, Sun.

416
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:09,059
