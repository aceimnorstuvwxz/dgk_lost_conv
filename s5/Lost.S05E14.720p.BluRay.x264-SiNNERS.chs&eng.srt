I need you to go there and find my mother. Her name is--

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,056

What happens if I can't get them all to come back?

5
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,069
那就只有上帝保佑了
Then god help us all.

我今天要返回小岛上

26
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:31,090
我相信Desmond中枪
And I believe it's my son's fault

27
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:35,041
都是因为我儿子犯下的错
That Desmond has been shot.

28
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:38,043
你儿子是Benjamin Linus吗
Your son is Benjamin Linus?

29
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:41,000
怎么可能
Good lord, no.

30
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:47,009
我儿子是Daniel Farady
My son is Dniel Faraday.

31
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:54,058
三十年前

32
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,044

Miles  好久不见
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.

36
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,016
注意了  先生女士们

回来干嘛  Dan
the hell are you doing back,Dan?

40
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:21,048
我以为你去安阿伯发大财了
Once you left for ann arbor, I figured you'd gotten rich,

41
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,068

这就是我为什么要回来
This is what I'm doing back here.

43
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:27,032
-他们什么时候来的
- When did they get here?

44
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,096
不久前
A few days ago.

45
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,015
真奇怪  对吧
It's weird, huh?

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,052
没时间了  我要你
We don't have time. I need you

47
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:34,082
马上带我去Jack哪里  好吗
To take me to Jack's right now, okay?

48
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,004
-Jack  你怎么回的  -Farady  你
- Jack. how did you get back here? - Faraday? what the--

49
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,099
你怎么做到的
How did you do it?

50
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,033
-你怎么回到岛上的  -你去哪里了
- How did you get back to the island? - where have you been?

51
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:54,023
我去达摩总部做研究  在安阿伯
I was--I was just at Dharma headquarters  in ann arbor. I was doing some research.

52
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,090
现在更加重要的是
What's more important right now...

53
00:02:55,093 --> 00:03:01,013
-你怎么回到1977年的  -怎么回事
- How did you get back here to 1977? - what's going on?

54
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:04,054
-别看我  我只帮他提箱子  -Jack  怎样来的
- Don't look at me. I just carried his luggage. - Jack, how?

55
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:08,008
嗯...我们坐飞机  然后...
Uh... we were on a plane, and then there was--

56
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,075
谁告诉你坐飞机的
Who told you to get on a plane?

57
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,016
事实上  Dan  是你的母亲
As a matter of fact, Dan, it was your mother.

58
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:18,064
那么她是怎样说服你的  Jack
And how did she convince you, Jack?

59
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:21,095
她告诉你这是你的宿命吗
Did she tell you it was your destiny?

60
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:24,081
对  她就这么说的
Yeah. That's exactly what she said.

61
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:27,062
我得告诉你点坏消息  Jack
Well, I got some bad news for you, Jack.

62
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:30,016
你根本就不属于这里
You don't belong here at all.

63
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,097
她错了
She was wrong.

64
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:24,031
怎么了  妈妈  你不喜欢吗
What's wrong, mom? Didn't you like it?

65
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:27,065
我喜欢得不行
I loved it.

66
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,077
太美妙了  Daniel
It was beautiful, Daniel.

67
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,076
Daniel
Daniel...

68
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,061
你知道命运是什么吗
Do you know what destiny means?

69
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,058
不知道
No.

70
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,029
命运就是
Destiny means that,

71
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:51,038
如果你有天赋
If one has a special gift,

72
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,096
那么你一定得去发挥它
Then it must be nurtured.

73
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:58,065
从你开始弹奏
How many beats has that metronome counted

74
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,070
一共有多少拍
Since you started playing?

75
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:02,017
864拍
864.

76
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:09,050
Daniel  你的天赋是  头脑
Your gift, daniel, is your mind--

77
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:13,043
一颗为科学和数学而生的头脑
A mind that is meant for science, mathematics.

78
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:18,001
而我的任务是
And it's my... job

79
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:21,098
确保你那样发展下去
To keep you on your path.

80
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,052
那么  不幸地是
So... unfortunately,

81
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:29,080
我不能给你太多的时间  让你分心
There's no more time... for distractions.

82
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:32,006
但是我想一直弹钢琴
But I want to keep playing the piano.

83
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,042
我可以两样兼顾
I can do both.

84
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:38,053
我能挤时间
I can make time.

85
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:42,066
那就等你能挤出时间再说
If only you could.

86
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,063
Miles  我要你带我去兰花站
Miles, I need you to bring me to the orchid.

87
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,060
你能现在载我去吗  求你了
Can you drive me right now? please?

88
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,066
-好  好的  -谢了
- Yeah, yeah, sure. I guess. - thanks.

89
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,062
来吧  我们出发
Come on. let's go.

90
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,063
Faraday  等等
Faraday! Wait up!

91
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,082
Miles  快点  Jack  我们马上回来
Miles, come on. Jack, we'll be right back.

92
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,095
你说你妈妈错了是什么意思  Daniel
Hey, what did you mean, you mother was wrong? daniel!

93
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:06,053
我去办点事  马上回来
I just--I just have an errand to run. Be right back!

94
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:16,046
-怎么  -Faraday回来了
- Yeah? - Faraday's back.

95
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:18,090
这话什么意思  为什么回来
What do you mean Faraday's back? Why?

96
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:22,040
我也不知道  他坐潜艇来  把我叫醒
I have no idea. He came in on the sub, and he woke me up.

97
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,049
就神神叨叨
He--he started talking nonsense,

98
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:26,057
然后就出发去兰花站了
And then he took off for the orchid.

99
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,033
很喜欢听你这套  但我现在有点忙
I'd love to trade theories about this,I'm little busy right now.

100
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:32,001
清晨6点  你忙什么
What are you busy in the 6 morning?

101
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:33,089
James  告诉他吧
James, tell him.

102
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,070
进来吧
Get in here.

103
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,064
Phil 我的一个保安手下
Phil-- one of my security guys--

104
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,024
发现一盒有我和Kate的录像带
Got himself a videotape of me and kate

105
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:50,075
带着那小孩去找那帮敌人
Taking the kid out to the hostiles.

106
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:53,060
-录像带呢  -Phil那里
- And where's the tape? - With phil.

107
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:55,065
Phil呢?
And where is phil?

108
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:01,059
Phil 这是Jack  Jack 这是Phil
Phil, jack. jack... phil.

109
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,072
我们是..
Are we...

110
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:16,054
在等什么吗
Waiting for something?

111
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:22,034
时间刚刚好
Right on time.

112
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:31,087
我10分钟后回来
I'll be back in ten minutes.

113
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:50,085
那你要我做什么
So what do you want me to do?

114
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:52,001
你什么都不用做
You're gonna do nothing.

115
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:54,015
如果你再钻深一厘米
If you drill even 1 centimeter further,

116
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:55,075
你将有可能释放那个能量
You risk releasing that energy.

117
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:57,084
如果这事发生了的话
If that were to happen...

118
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:00,061
那么就让上帝保佑我们吧
Then god help us all.

119
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:04,023
你在这里要带安全帽
Hey! you need a hard hat down here.

120
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,095
走路带眼
Watch yourself!

121
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:16,087
对不起 不会再这样了
Sorry, sir. Won't happen again.

122
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,068
我来拿一些东西  我们走
I'll grab the rest of his stuff. Let's go.

123
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:30,035
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

124
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:34,020
时空旅行  那人以为我们有多蠢
Time travel. How stupid does that guy think we are?

125
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,082
陈博士
Dr. Chang?

126
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,055
陈博士
Dr. Chang?

127
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,093
-有空吗  -看来有
- Do you have a second, sir? - I suppose.

128
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:47,013
我刚和潜艇上的天鹅队
I just came in on the sub with the swan team.

129
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:49,020
其实我们三年前见过  我是Daniel Faraday
We actually met three years ago, I'm Daniel Faraday.

130
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,088
你和Lafleur一起来的  我记得
Yes. yes. uh, you arrived with Lafleur. I remember. right.

131
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:53,033
我能帮你什么忙
What can I do for you?

132
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,090
我需要你下命令
I need you to order the evacuation

133
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,033
让岛上所有男女老少撤离这座岛
Of every man, woman and child on this island.

134
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:00,042
我凭什么这么做呢
And why would I do that?

135
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:02,050
因为担架上的那个人
Because that man is on a stretcher

136
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:05,065
就是你们在这里钻着泄露出来
As a consequence of the electromagnetic activity

137
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,098
电磁效应的后果
That your drilling unleashed down here.

138
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,009
而且这里充满了
Which is now contained.

139
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,062
这里充满了

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,076
你好  Daniel
Hello, Daniel.

276
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:38,009
对不起先生  我不...
I'm sorry, sir. I don't...

277
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,029
Caroline跟您说我我有病吗
D-did Caroline tell you I have a condition

278
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,029
这个会影响我的记忆  就会
That affects my memory? Just...

279
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,089
别担心  我们没有见过
Don't be embarrassed. We've never met.

280
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,057
我是Charles Widmore
My name is Charles Widmore.

281
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,015
Charles
Charles...

283
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,026
资助我的研究的那个

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,050
很高兴见到您  请坐
It's very nice to meet you, sir. Please, sit down.

285
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,045
这儿很乱
Mm, a bit of a mess.

286
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:08,054
我很想感谢您
I meant to thank you

287
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:10,086
在我
Before I...

288
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,056
在我离开牛津之前
Before I left oxford.

289
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,059
你是说再你被开除之前
You mean, before you were dismissed.

290
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,037
我实验过
I tested it...

291
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,074
我事先在我身上做的实验
I tested it out on myself first.

292
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:25,066
-没事的  Daniel  -我绝不会伤害theresa
- It's all right, Daniel. - I would never hurt Theresa.

293
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,046
没事的
It's all right.

294
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,025
我不是为这个而来
That's not why I'm here.

295
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:33,014
我来是给你一个新的机会的
I came to offer you a new opportunity.

296
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,099
不  我...
N-no, I...

297
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:44,005
对不起  我不能  我想我不能...
I'm sorry. I...I can't. I don't think I...I can...

298
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:51,052
我说了什么令你伤心的话吗
Did I say something to upset you?

299
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:55,000
是那场飞机失事
It's this plane crash.

300
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:58,076
我不知道为什么这让我如此烦恼
I don't know why it's bothering me so much.

301
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,026
就是这么悲伤
It's just so sad.

302
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,039
他们都死了
They're dead.

303
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:10,078
Daniel  如果我告诉你
Daniel, what if I told you...

304
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,052
他们并没有死
They're not dead?

305
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,007
如果我告诉你
What if I told you

306
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:19,019
那飞机是个替代品
The plane was a fake?

307
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:23,078
人为设置的  昂贵的替代品
An elaborate... expensive fake.

308
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,030
你怎么知道的呢
How would you know that?

309
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,019
因为是我设置的
Because I put it there.

310
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:41,040
为什么要告诉我呢
Why would you tell me that?

311
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:47,039
因为到了明天  你就不记得我说过
Because come tomorrow, you won't remember I did.

312
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:51,038
Daniel
Daniel,

313
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,065
真正的大洋航班815号坠毁到一个岛上
The real oceanic flight 815 crashed on an island-

314
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,046
一个特别的小岛上
A special island

315
00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:01,011
岛上有独特的科学性质
With unique scientific properties.

316
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:05,053
我想派你去那座岛
I want to send you to the island.

317
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:09,024
那会对你的研究很有帮助
It will further your research,

318
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,040
给你展现各种
Show you things

319
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,070
你未曾想象过的现象
You'd never dream of.

320
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:17,024
但更重要的是
But more importantly,

321
00:20:17,027 --> 00:20:19,067
它会治愈你的  Daniel
It will heal you, Daniel

322
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,004
你的心智
Your mind,

323
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:25,027
你的记忆
Your memory.

324
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,001
治愈我吗
H-heal me?

325
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,038
你为什么为我这么做呢
W-why are you doing all this for me?

326
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:38,063
因为你是个很有才华的人
Because you're a man of tremends gifts,

327
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:41,071
把这些才华浪费掉是很可耻的
And it would be a shame to see them go to waste.

328
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:48,077
你说话像我母亲
You sound like my mother.

329
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,096
因为我们是老朋友
That's because we're old friends.

330
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:04,022
你母亲是另一个
You're mother is an other?

331
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:05,092
实际上你见过她
You met her, actually,

332
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:09,001
当这岛消失回到1954年时
When the island was skipping, back in 1954.

333
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,014
他们叫她Ellie
They were calling her "Ellie."

334
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:12,023
你们去过1954年
You guys were in 1954?

335
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:16,005
-像冻结时间吗  -你还没有
- Like... fonzie times? - You still haven't

336
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:17,067
告诉我们为什么要找到她
Told us why you need find her.

337
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,066
我只要跟她谈谈
I just need to talk to her.

338
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,015
医生说我们理应死了的
Doc said we are supposed to be laid low

339
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:21,051
木已成舟
"whatever happened, happened"?

340
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:22,035
只是告诉我他们在哪
Just tell me where they  are

341
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:24,045
我不会告诉你任何事  你也别想
I'm not telling you anything, and you ain't

342
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:25,092
去任何地方  除非
Going anywhere, unless you wanna

343
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,065
你告诉我们你在这到底干什么
Share with us what the hell it is you're doing.

344
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:30,018
Sawyer  他说他能带我们回到属于我们的世界
Sawyer, he said he can get us back to where we belonged.

345
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,042
不管是上潜艇还是回到丛林
Whether we go on the sub or we head back into the jungle...

346
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:37,035
-我们不只属于这里  -可我属于
- We don't belong here. - Well, I belonged

347
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:39,086
这里  却发现你回来了  医生
Here just fine out you came back, doc.

348
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:47,070
你知道敌人在哪吗
You know where the hostiles are.

349
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:51,014
-说什么  -你和Sawyer带Ben去找他们
- What? - You and Sawyer took Ben out to them.

350
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:53,037
你能带我们去吗
Can you get us back out there?

351
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:55,018
打住  别说任何话  Kate
Hold on a second. Don't say a word, Kate..

352
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:58,002
她想说什么就说什么  Kate
She can say what she wants to say. Kate...

353
00:21:58,002 --> 00:22:01,013
你要我发誓从不过问Aron怎么了
You made me promise to never ask what happened to Aron,

354
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:03,002
又或者为什么你回到这里
Or why you came back here.

355
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:06,044
但我知道原因没有藏在这里
But I know that reason isn't... it isn't here.

356
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:08,018
也不是现在
It's not now.

357
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,091
不管她是什么原因
Whatever her reason is,

358
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,052
带这个疯子去和她妈谈
Helping H.G. wells here talk to his mommy

359
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:16,000
绝对和这没有关系
Ain't got nothing to do with it.

360
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,008
跟我们走  雀斑女
Come with us, Freckles.

361
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:28,045
防护栏的密码 是141717
The code for the fence Is 1-4-1-7-1-7.

362
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:31,030
你该带Daniel去
You should take Daniel.

363
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:34,077
怎么都好 这里对我们来说已经结束了
It's over here for us anyway.

364
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:40,026
好吧
Okay.

365
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:43,046
我们走
Let's go.

366
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,092
太好了
Great.

367

太好了  谢谢
Great. Thank you.

368
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:48,092
Miles  你能开车带我们吗
Hey, Miles, can you drive us?

369
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:01,042
当你意识到你犯了多么大的错误时
When you realize you've made a huge mistake...

370
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:05,083
我们会回到海岸边  在我们开始的地方
We'll be back at the beach, right where we started.

371
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:13,078
好了  剩下的这些人
All right, the rest of us--

372
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:16,042
带好你需要的物品  20分钟后这里见
Pack anything you can carry, meet back here in 20 minutes.

373
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:25,011
该出发了
Time to go.

374
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:34,008
这些人不会高兴见到我们的
These people are not gonna be happy to see us.

375
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,062
也许带些几把枪是个好主意
It might be a good idea to bring some guns.

376
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:40,030
发动机的棚子里有个枪支保险箱 但是锁了
There's a gun safe in the motor pool, But it's locked.

377
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:43,054
还好我是看门的
Good thing I'm a janitor then.

378
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:46,018
Dan
Hey, Dan?

379
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:49,062
我去发动机棚子找你们  给我一分钟 行吧
I'll meet you at the motor pool. I need just a minute. Okay?

380
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:14,068
他们不准我在饭前吃巧克力的
I'm not allowed to have chocolate before dinner.

381
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:21,009
亲爱的  没事的
It's okay, sweetheart.

382
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:24,021
我不会揭发你
I won't tell.

383
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:28,004
我叫Charlotte  你叫什么
My name's Charlotte. What's yours?

384
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:32,039
我叫Daniel
I'm Daniel.

385
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:35,034
我是新来的
I'm new here.

386
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:40,035
听好
Listen.

387
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:42,025
你认识陈博士吗
Do you know Dr. Chang?

388
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:47,044
很快
Hopefully really soon,

389
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:50,077
陈博士就要让一群人
Dr. Chang is gonna ask a bunch of people

390
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,093
登上潜艇
To get on the submarine

391
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:55,096
然后离开这座岛
And leave the island.

392
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:59,029
当他这么做的时候  你和你母亲
When he does, you and your mommy...

393
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:01,079
你们得离开
You're gonna have to leave.

394
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,078
以防我的方法行不通
In case what I do doesn't work,

395
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:08,053
你不能呆在这里  你一定得走
You cannot be here. You have to leave.

396
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:13,089
我不想告诉你这个的
I tried to avoid telling you this.

397
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:16,018
我不认为我能改变过去
I didn't think I could change things.

398
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:22,048
但也许我能
But maybe I can.

399
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:35,055
我们得多久到那里
Hey, how long will it take us to Get up there?

400
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:39,055
看情况  我们可以走大路到塔那儿
Ah, it depends. We can take the road until we hit the pylons,

401
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,065
一旦我们进入他们攻击范围  就得步行
But then once we're in their territory, we gotta go on foot.

402
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:44,088
有没有给新手用的
Okay. uh, do you have something for a beginner?

403
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:50,081
我们走
Let's go.

404
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:54,095
准备好走
That's ready to go.

405
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,094
出了什么事吗
What's going on here?

406
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,067
你不是潜艇下来的一个物理学家吗
Aren't you one of the physicists off the sub?

407
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,098
对  我们只是想确认下
Yeah, that's right. Uh, we were just making sure that

408
00:26:03,098 --> 00:26:06,036
你应该在天鹅站的
You're supposed to out of the swan site.

409
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,067
兰花站
Right. uh, there was--

410
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,035
出了点事故
There was an accident at the orchid station.

411
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,088
-陈博士我们来帮忙  -他手里有枪
- Dr. Chang asked us to help. - He's got a gun.

412
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:17,094
我刚从陈博士那里来
I just left Dr. Chang.

413
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:20,051
他在家陪老婆孩子  你在撒谎
He's at home with his wife and baby. You're lying.

414
00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:23,030
丢掉武器  趴在地上
Now drop the guns and get down on the ground!

415
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:25,007
听我说
Hey. Listen to me. Listen.

416
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,015
你真的不明白这里发什么什么事
You really do not understand what's happening here.

417
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:30,024
你不明白  我们没时间了  必须走
You have no idea. We have no time. We have to leave.

418
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:32,079
行吗  我们现在就走
All right? So we're just gonna leave.

419
00:26:32,082 --> 00:26:34,072
没人  
Nobody's...No...

420
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:45,082
你还好吗
Are you okay?

421
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:54,070
我们该到车上去
I think we can make it to the jeep.

422
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:56,097
好的  我掩护你
All right. i'll cover you.

423
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:58,081
Dan  你也去  好吗
Dan? you go, too, all right?

424
00:26:59,057 --> 00:27:00,040
快  快  快
Go, go, go!

425
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:33,070
拉响警报
Sound the alarm!

426
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,024
你好  Daniel
Hello, Daniel.

427
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:11,000
你什么时候来的
When did you get here?

428
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:12,079
我刚到
Oh, I just arrived.

429
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,042
本想给你先打个电话  可是...
I would have called you, but...

430
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:16,091
反正我会忘掉的
I would have forgotten anyway.

431
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:23,041
我听说有人要给你一个工作
I hear you have been offered a job.

432
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,099
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

433
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:29,072
我一直都知道
Well, it's my business to know.

434
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:32,095
Daniel  我来这
I came here, daniel,

435
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:36,010
是想告诉你  这件事至关重要
To tell you that it is very important

436
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,046
你该答应Widmore先生
That you say yes to Mr. Widmore...

437
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,019
接受这次机会
That you accept this opportunity.

438
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:46,041
我不能
I can't.

439
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,072
他需要一个
He needs someone who can do

440
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:55,010
能够校准十分复杂的时空
Really, really complex space-time calibrations

441
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,027
并且计算出方位的人  可是我
And calculate bearings, and I just...

442
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,043
已经不在懂得如何去做了
I don't know how to do that anymore.

443
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:01,045
Daniel
Daniel...

444
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:06,028
那个他向你提起的地方  那个小岛
This place he mentioned to you, this island--

445
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:10,054
他有没有告诉你它可以治好你
Did he tell you that it could make you better?

446
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:17,060
如果那是真的呢
What if it's true?

447
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:20,077
怎么了  这样你就可以继续你的工作了
Why, then you could go on with your work.

448
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:24,074
想想你能完成的事业吧
Just think of all you could accomplish.

449
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,088
你真的想让我...去吗
You really want me to... to go?

450
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:33,039
是的
Yes.

451
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:39,016
那...
Will...

452
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:41,040
这会让你为我感到骄傲吗
Will it make you proud of me?

453
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:48,068
是的  Daniel
Yes, Daniel.

454
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:50,017
会的
It will.

455
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:01,065
好的  我去
Then I'll do it.

456
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:22,028
-你还记得密码吗  -记得
- You remember the code? - Yeah, I got it.

457
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:25,008
好的  让我看看
All right, I'm gonna take a look at that.

458
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:28,022
好的
Yeah, good.

459
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,079
只是擦伤
It's just a graze. Whew.

460
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
会有点刺痛
This is gonna sting.

461
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,061
好的
Yeah.

462
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:39,034
好的  很快就好了
Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

463
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:41,046
我可真幸运
I guess I'm lucky.

464
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,067
这跟幸运有什么关系
What's luck have to do with it?

465
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,085
你不是说该发生的事  肯定会发生的吗
I thought you said whatever happened, happened.

466
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:48,024
你会明白的  Jack
You gotta understand, Jack,

467
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:50,070
这是我们的现在
This is our present.

468
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,026
我们见面时  我的脖子上有疤吗
When we met, did I have a scar on my neck?

469
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:54,073
没有
No.

470
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:57,006
那是因为我还没有被枪击
'cause I hadn't been shot yet.

471
00:30:57,096 --> 00:31:00,080
我们不能天真的认为我们不会出事
We can't be so naive as to think nothing can happen to us.

472
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,005
我们中的任何人都会死  Jack
Any one of us can die, Jack.

473
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,015
好的
Okay.

474
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:09,026
已经关了
It's off.

475
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:12,029
谢谢
Thanks.

476
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:17,039
哪条路
Which way?

477
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,058
往里走2英里
Just a couple miles in.

478
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:29,061
你觉得他知道自己在做什么吗
Do you think he knows what he's doing?

479
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:31,081
希望如此
I sure hope so.

480
00:31:33,053 --> 00:31:34,089
已经回不了头了
There's no turning back now.

481
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:44,039
你刚刚给那些蠢货打电话让他们来着
You called it the minute those yahoos got here.

482
00:31:44,098 --> 00:31:46,012
你该告诉我的
I shoulda listened to you.

483
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,096
你可以说  那我也告诉你
You can say, "I told you so."

484
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:51,074
等我们到了岸上吧
Maybe after we get to the beach.

485
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,033
你还支持我吗
You still got my back?

486
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,010
你呢
You still got mine?

487
00:32:14,046 --> 00:32:16,017
这下糟了
That's not good, right?

488
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,032
Lafleur
Lafleur!

489
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,090
你去哪了  
Where have you been? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

490
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:29,059
别紧张  发生什么事了
Take it easy, stu. What the hell's going on?

491
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,057
我被一个物理学家打了一枪
I just got shot by a physicist,

492
00:32:31,094 --> 00:32:34,060
还有新兵在帮他
And the new recruits are helping him.

493
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,035
我们中有奸细
We've been infiltrated.

494
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:39,019
太荒唐了  冷静些
That's ridiculous. Now just calm down for a minute.

495
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,029
我们谈谈
We can talk about this.

496
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:43,058
那是什么
What was that?

497
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:45,067
好像是从外面传过来的
It sounded like it was from outside.

498
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,095
趴在地上
Get down on the ground now.

499
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:07,043
马上
I said now!

500
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,026
谢谢
Thank you.

501
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:34,086
你需要拿着枪跟你妈妈说话吗  Dan
You need a gun to go talk to your mother, Dan?

502
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,081
你不了解我妈妈  Jack
You don't know my mother, Jack.

503
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,049
准备告诉我们为什么她是错的了吗
You ready to tell me why she was wrong?

504
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:47,043
为什么我们不属于这里
Why we don't belong here?

505
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:59,059
四个小时之内
In about four hours,

506
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:02,056
天鹅工作区的达摩组织的人
The dharma folks at the swan work site--

507
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:05,034
他们将会钻到地下
They're gonna--gonna drill into the ground

508
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:08,002
并且会意外碰到巨大能量袋
And accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy.

509
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,086
这个能量的释放
The result of the release of this energy

510
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,023
会造成一场灾难
Would be catastrophic.

511
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:16,095
为了能够抑制它  他们不得不用水泥
So in order to contain it, they're gonna have to cement

512
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,095
注满整个地区就像切尔诺贝利核电站一样
The entire area in, like chernobyl.

513
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:23,045
这个容器  就是他们建造它的地方
And this containment--the place they built over it--

514
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,089
我想你叫它船舱
I believe you called it "the hatch."

515
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:29,014
天鹅船舱
The swan hatch?

516
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:35,037
因为这场意外
Because of this one accident,

517
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:37,095
这群人会在接下来20年里
These people is gona spend next twenty years

518
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:41,036
来抑制那个能量
Keeping that energy at bay...

519
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,066
通过不停的按一个按钮
By pressing a button...

520
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,017
而这个按钮将会被你的朋友Desmond
A button that your friend desmond

521
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,025
在某一天忘了按
Will one day fail to push,

522
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:53,080
而这个就令到你们做的飞机
And that will cause your plane--

523
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:56,037
海洋航空815班机
Oceanic 815--

524
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,043
坠毁到这个岛上
To crash on this island.

525
00:34:58,046 --> 00:35:01,035
而因为你们的航班坠毁
And because your plane crashed,

526
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:03,005
令到有一架货轮被派到这个岛上
A freighter will be sent to this island--

527
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:05,057
和其他有关的人都在上面
And charlotte was on it and so forth.

528
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:07,003
这整个相关的一连串事件
This entire chain of events--

529
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:10,089
将会在今天下午开始发生
It's gonna start happening this afternoon.

530
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,010
可是
But...

531
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:16,088
我们可以改变这一切
We can change that.

532
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:19,036
我一生都致力于研究相对物理
I studied relativistic physics my entire life.

533
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,093
有一个观念一直主导着我
One thing emerged over and over--

534
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:24,012
不可能改变过去  不可能
Can't change the past. Can't do it.

535
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:27,025
已经发生的  早就发生了
Whatever happened, happened. All right?

536
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:31,076
可是我最后发现
But then I finally realized...

537
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,009
我花了大量的时间研究
I had been spending so much time

538
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:37,001
常量
Focused on the constants,

539
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:39,020
可是我忽略了变量
I forgot about the variables.

540
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:42,023
Jack  你知道在这些公式里面的变量吗
Do you know what the variables in these equations are, jack?

541
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:44,056
不知道
No.

542
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,037
我们
Us.

543
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,094
我们是变量
We're the variables.

544
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:49,064
人
People.

545
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,023
我们思考  我们讲道理
We think. we reason.

546
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:54,015
我们做不同的选择  我们有自由的思想
We make choices. We have free will.

547
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,007
我们可以改变我们的命运
We can change our destiny.

548
00:35:59,062 --> 00:36:03,022
我认为我可以中和那股能量
I think I can negate that energy

549
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,046
在天鹅站下面的那股
Under e swan.

550
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:07,069
我想我可以毁灭它
I think I can destroy it.

551
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:10,071
如果我能的话  那密封舱就不需要被建造
If I can, then that hatch will never be built,

552
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:13,017
而你们的飞机
And your plane...

553
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,099
将会降落
Your plane will land,

554
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:17,024
在它应该降落的地方
Just like it's supposed to,

555
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:19,078
