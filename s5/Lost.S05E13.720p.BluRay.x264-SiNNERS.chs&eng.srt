你要做的是听我的指挥

And I need to know why you won't talk to me about my father.

108
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,093
因为他从不关心我们

他不想和我们有关系

116
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:00,040
你对他知道的越少

117
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:02,030
就越好
The better.

118
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:08,075

如果你只要有人开车
If you just need somebody to drive the van,

132
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,048
车辆调配场的人也可以
Can't someone from the motor pool do it?

133
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:09,033
如果我要车辆调配厂的人

Nah, dude, I just signed it out.

140
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:35,070
不管  这是我的
Doesn't matter. it's mine.

141
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:38,020
-你去哪  -兰花站
- Well, where you going? - The orchid.

142
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,034
我也是  我给他们做了午餐  三明治
Me. too. I made lunch for the crew. Sandwiches.

143
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:44,035
你要吗  火腿和芝士和秘制的洋葱蛋黄酱
Want one? Ham and cheese, and I made my secret garlic mayo.

144
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:47,048
你等下辆车吧
You're waiting for the next van.

145
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:49,097
为什么  我们去同一个地方  为什么不拼车呢
Why? we're going to the same place. Why don't we carpool?

146
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:52,060
帮助防止现在还没发生的全球变暖
It'll help with global warming, which hasn't happened yet,

147
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,015
我们或许可以防止它发生
So maybe we can prevent it.

148
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,054
-等等  你是在做秘密任务吗  -进来吧
- Wait a sec. Are you on some kind of secret mission? - Just get in.

149
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:12,050
怎么样了
How'd it go?

150
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,053
我们把他交给小岛居民了
We gave him to them-- to the others.

151
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:18,015
-有人看见你了吗  -我想没有
- Anyone see you? - I don't think so.

152
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:19,070
James帮忙了吗
Did James help?

153
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:23,007
帮了  非常感谢你让他来
Yes. Thank you so much for sending him.

154
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,006
不客气
Of course.

155
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:28,009
我尽快过来了
I got here as soon as I could.

156
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:31,006
车子都走了  所以我
All the vans were out, so I had to ru--

157
00:11:35,086 --> 00:11:36,090
Ben去哪了
Where's Ben?

158
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,099
-没有  Roger  -那他在哪里
- No, Roger. - Then where is he?

159
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:47,085
Roger  抱歉  我离开了10分钟  我不清楚
Roger, i-i'm so sorry. i-i was gone for ten minutes.I-i-i don't know.

160
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:50,092
什么  你说他生命垂危  怎么还会跑了
What? you--you said he was dying. how could he be gone?

161
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:51,061
我不知道
I don't know!

162
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:53,098
-Roger  -她在说什么鬼话  他就这样自己走了吗
I'm--roger-- what is she telling me, that he just got up and walked out?

163
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:54,054
我不知道
I don't know.

164
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,018
你们是他的医生  应该看好他
I just got-- you're his doctors! you're supposed to watch him!

165
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:59,080
-我知道  Roger  我们该冷静下来  -别叫我冷静
- I know. I know. roger, if we just calm down- Don't tell me to calm down!

166
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,036
-有人来带走我的人吗  -我了解你的心情  抱歉
- Somebody came and took my boy out of here?! - I know. I am so sorry.

167
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,044
我要去监控室看录像
I'm going to security.

168
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,060
这下可好了
Here we go.

169
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,042
"赏金猎人"怎么拼
How do you spell "bounty hunter"?

170
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,031
你在干什么  写回忆录吗
What are you doing, writing your memoirs?

171
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:39,059
这是隐私
It's personal.

172
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:49,073
兄弟
Dude...

173
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,000
你是不是...
Did you just... you know?

174
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,064
怎么
What?

175
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,053
好臭  你有没有
It stinks. did you...

176
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,001
没有
No.

177
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:01,044
不是我放的
Well, it wasn't me.

178
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,025
那就把车窗摇下
So roll down your window.

179
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:09,079
算了  是从车里发出的臭味
Nah, man, there's something foul in here.

180
00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:13,051
从后面传来的  可能是三明治的大蒜味
It's coming from back there. maybe it's your famous garlic mayo.

181
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:14,083
不可能
Unh-unh. that's not possible.

182
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,071
好吧  有可能  停车  我去检查
Okay, maybe it is possible. pull over. I gotta check.

183
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:21,045
算了吧  你有幻想症  我去检查
Forget it. you're imagining things. I gotta check.

184
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:23,001
如果那些三明治变质了  人吃了就会生病
If those sandwiches are bad, people could get sick.

185
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,036
能不能停车
Will you pull over?!

186
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:52,073
兄弟  这里有个装尸袋
Dude, there's a body bag back here.

187
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:56,025
-里面有具尸体  -装尸袋里都装尸体
- There's a body in it. - That's traditionally what you put in a body bag.

188
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,082
这人是谁  发生了什么事
Yeah, well, who is he? what happened?

189
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:02,037
这你就不用操心了  也别告诉别人
Don't worry about it and don't tell anybody you saw him.

190
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:03,073
兄弟  他怎么了
Dude, what happened to him?

191
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:07,061
他叫Alvarez
His name's Alvarez.

192
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,091
当时在挖洞
He was digging a hole

193
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:11,038
脑子里在想个叫Andrea的女人
And thinking about some chick named Andrea.

194
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:15,023
然后他感到口腔一阵剧痛
Then he felt this sharp pain in his mouth,

195
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:17,073
然后牙齿中产生了一种填充物
Which turned out to be a filling from his tooth

196
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,095
从牙缝中被拔了出来
Being yanked right out of its socket and...

197
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:21,092
然后猛地进入了他的脑
Blowing through his brain.

198
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,086
然后他就死了
Then he was dead.

199
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:27,067
一种填充物如何能猛地进入人脑
How does a filling get blown through someone's head?

200
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:30,038
你知道我的小秘密了  可以走了吗
Got me. can we go now?

201
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,054
你怎么知道这些
How do you know all this?

202
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,053
因为  我本来就知道
Because... I know.

203
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,045
对  可你怎么知道他的思想活动
Yeah, but how do you know what he was thinking?

204
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,032
我就是知道
I just know.

205
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:41,077
你可以和亡者交流
You can talk to dead people.

206
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:45,071
我们可以走了吗
Can we please just go?

207
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,018
别担心  兄弟  我会守口如瓶
Don't worry, dude. your secret's safe with me.

208
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:53,050
-想知道为什么吗  -不想
- You wanna know why? - No.

209
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,016
因为我也可以和他们对话
'cause I can talk to 'em, too.

210
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:08,052
Gray先生  如果你不介意的话
If you don't mind, mr. Gray,

211
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,003
能告诉我他身上发生了什么事吗
Can you tell me what happened to him?

212
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:13,054
上个劳动节周末
Last labor day weekend,

213
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:16,068
醉酒司机闯了红灯
Drunk driver ran the light.

214
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,037
就这样丢了命
That was that.

215
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,054
你儿子埋在哪里
Where is your son buried?

216
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:25,008
我们把他火葬了
We cremated him,

217
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,015
然后把他的骨灰洒在了学校足球场
Scattered the ashes on the football field at school.

218
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:32,072
我力所能及的是  最好有具尸体
For what I do, it's much better if there's a body.

219
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:37,028
可你打的广告上说你可以和亡者交流
Oh, but your ad said you could communicate with the dead

220
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:39,003
无论何时  无论何地
Anytime, anywhere.

221
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:41,063
-我知道我的广告标语  Gray先生  可  -拜托
- I-i know what my ad says, mr. Gray, but- Please.

222
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,031
我只想让你问他
I just want you to ask him...

223
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:51,000
他知道我爱他吗
Did he know that I loved him?

224
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:55,057
需要另外收费
It's gonna cost extra.

225
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,065
好的
Of course.

226
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,075
谢谢
Thank you.

227
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,034
好  现在
Okay, now...

228
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,051
把手给我
Please give me your hands.

229
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,039
我要你集中注意想Russell
I want you to concentrate on Russell.

230
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,099
在脑海中浮现出他的画面
Just get a picture of him in your head.

231
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:30,021
-能做到吗  -能
- Can you do that? - Yeah. okay.

232
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:47,077
有效果吗
Did it work?

233
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,001
你儿子说他知道你爱他
Your son says he knew that you loved him.

234
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,076
他心里一直都很清楚
He always knew.

235
00:16:58,006 --> 00:17:01,018
-谢谢  -对于你儿子的死  我很遗憾
- Thank you. - I'm sorry for your loss.

236
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,034
请问
Excuse me.

237
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,098
-你是Miles Straume吗  -是
- Miles Straume? - Yeah.

238
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,056
你好  我叫Naomi Dorrit
Hi. my name's Naomi Dorrit.

239
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:21,045
我的老板已经对你的工作追踪了一段时间
My employer's been following your work for some time now,

240
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:24,032
他对你的独特本领很感兴趣
And he's interested in retaining your rather unique services.

241
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:27,045
离这不远有家餐馆
There's a restaurant not too far from here.

242
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,041
你有兴趣听我详细说说吗
Would you like to hear what I have to say?

243
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:32,030
好  当然可以
Yeah. absolutely.

244
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:12,084
Roger
Hi, roger.

245
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:17,008
你还好吧
You okay?

246
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:20,018
让我想想
Let me see...

247
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:22,055
我儿子中枪了
Well, my son got shot

248
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:24,095
然后他离奇失踪
And now he's disappeared, so...

249
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:28,052
我想我心情糟透了
I think I'm pretty far from okay.

250
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:32,007
我肯定
You know, I'm sure...

251
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,097
一切都会有转机
Things are gonna work out.

252
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:41,044
谢谢你的鼓舞之词
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

253
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:46,002
我只是有中感觉  他会相安无事
I just have a feeling he's gonna be okay.

254
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,047
什么意思  感觉
What do you mean, a feeling?

255
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,055
我只是觉得你不该放弃希望
I just don't think that you should give up hope.

256
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:03,095
你是不是知道其中隐情
Do you know something?

257
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,036
-你知道我儿子的下落吗  -不  我不知道
- Do you know what happened to my son? - No, I don't.

258
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:10,069
等等
Wait a minute.

259
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:13,031
你怎么对我孩子那么感兴趣
Why are you so interested in my kid?

260
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:15,003
我很抱歉过来和你说话
You know, I'm sorry I came over here, all right?

261
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:19,012
你只是想帮忙  你想帮忙吗  Kate
Oh, you're trying to help, huh? you wanna help, Kate?

262
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:21,051
你何不管好自己的分内事
Well, why don't you just mind your own business?

263
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,015
我不懂你为什么不肯承认
I don't know why you just won't admit it.

264
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:46,052
你可以相信我  我和很多死者交谈过
You can trust me. I talk to lots of dead people.

265
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,024
你和他们交谈  就好像他们是你的朋友吗
So you have conversations with them, like they're your pals?

266
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:53,078
对  自始至终都这样  有时我们还对弈
Sure, all the time. sometimes we even play chess.

267
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,099
你亲眼见到他们吗
You actually see them?

268
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:59,095
-当然  为什么见不到  -因为不会见到
- Of course. why wouldn't i? - Because that's not how it works.

269
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:02,056
除非你真能见到  不然不会知道其中奥秘
Aha! you wouldn't knowow it works unless you can do it.

270
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:04,002
我做的事
What I can do

271
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,018
和与鬼魂下棋无关  傻子
Has nothing to do with chatting with ghosts, you nitwit.

272
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:09,050
这是种感觉  一种感应
It's a feeling, a sense.

273
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,033
人死后  大脑就不会运转
When somebody's dead, their brain stops functioning,

274
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,089
他们就不会说话
Which means there's no more talking.

275
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,014
只留下的记忆是他们的身份
There's just who they were

276
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:19,056
-还有他们死前的记忆  -这我也知道
- And whatever they knew before they died. - That's how it works for me.

277
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:22,023
好  我真为你感到高兴
Great. I'm happy for you.

278
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:24,042
你只是嫉妒我的本事比你强
You're just jealous my powers are better than yours.

279
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:26,079
这样吧
We're here.

280
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:29,095
闭上嘴  乖乖送你的三明治
Now shut the hell up and deliver your damn sandwiches.

281
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,053
他在这里干什么
What's he doing here?

282
00:20:55,096 --> 00:20:58,092
他来给工作人员送午餐
Um, he came to deliver lunch to the work crew.

283
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,086
午餐  你的工作说明上要求你一个人来
Lunch? your instructions were to come alone.

284
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,042
别担心  我不会告诉别人死尸的事
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about the body.

285
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:10,082
抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, sir.

286
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:14,028
-他在后车厢乱翻  然后就看到了  -兄弟
-He--he was rooting around in the back, and he saw it. - Dude.

287
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,004
我可以保密
I can keep a secret.

288
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,029
最好如此
Well, you'd better...

289
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,094
Hurley  如果你不愿在厨房工作
Hurley, 'cause if you think working in the kitchen is bad--

290
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:22,030
我喜欢在厨房工作
I like the kitchen.

291
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:26,023
你觉得北极熊的粪便味道怎样
Well, how do you feel about polar bear feces?

292
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:28,033
因为如果你敢泄露半个字
Because if you breathe one word of this,

293
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:30,020
我就把你运到长蛇岛
I'll have you shipped to hydra island

294
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,073
你就可以给那些可笑的实验品称粪便了
So you can weigh turds for their ridiculous experiments.

295
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:38,042
你们俩
You two!

296
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,098
把包裹抬进去
Get the package inside.

297
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:46,025
你呢  呆在这里等我回来
And you? stay here till I get back.

298
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,091
-你自认为可以处理这些吗  -是  先生
- You think you can handle that? - Yes, sir.

299
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:03,029
兄弟  那家伙真是个杂种
Dude, that guy's a total douche.

300
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:07,014
-你不适合干  -那杂种是我爸
- You are not qualified to be... - That douche is my dad.

301
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:18,019
你真的说过要带我去吃饭
You did say you were taking me out to dinner.

302
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,034
不  我说我要带你去家餐馆
No, I said I was taking you to a restaurant.

303
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:25,023
亲爱的  想告诉我这儿藏着什么吗
You wanna tell me what's back here, sweetheart?

304
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,001
你的面试
Your audition.

305
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,021
不管这里发生了什么
Look, whatever you got going on here,

306
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,051
都不关我的事
This isn't really my thing.

307
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,034
Miles  就我了解的来看
From what I understand, Miles,

308
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:40,080
如果价格足够高的话  这正是你的工作
If the price is right, this is exactly your thing.

309
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:44,072
那么关于这个人你能告诉些我什么呢
So what can you tell me about this man?

310
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,043
他叫Felix
His name's Felix.

311
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,019

去送东西的路上

交给一个叫Wildmore的人
A guy named... Widmore.

314
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,053
送什么呢
Deliver what?

315
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:34,040
一堆纸  照片  图画什么的
A bunch of papers, photos, pictures...

316
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,025
都是关于
Of...

317
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:40,032
挖空的坟墓
Empty graves.

318
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,074
还有一张买一架旧飞机的
A purchase order...

319
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:45,002
购货单
For an old airplane.

320
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,044
那么
So...

321
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,049
我的工作完成了吗
Did I pass?

322
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,098
我正要带领一次探险  去一座岛屿
I'm leading an expedition to an island,

323
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:04,067
而岛上有那么一个人
And on the island is a man that

324
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,015
我们很难找到他
Will be very difficult to find.

325
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:09,076
-所以我需要你  -需要我干什么呢
- That's why I need you. - Need me for what?

326
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:12,051
岛上有一群死去的人
This island has a number of deceased individuals...

327
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,023
他们以前住在那里  正是这个人
Residing on it, and as this man is

328
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:17,033
要为他们的遇害负上全责
The one responsible for their being deceased.

329
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:19,073
我们确信关于那个人的下落
We believe they can supply invaluable information

330
00:24:19,073 --> 00:24:20,099
这群尸体可以给我们很多珍贵的线索
As to his where abouts.

331
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:24,069
听起来就和去捕获一个杀人魔
As much as hunting down a mass murderer

332
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,092
一样安全
Sounds really safe,

333

337
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,021
总之
So anyway...

338
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:55,039
-我不想讨论这个  -你开玩笑吧
- I don't want to talk about it. - Are you kidding me?

339
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,095
你父亲是那些影片里面的那个人
How weird is it that your dad is

340
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,065
这听起来多怪异啊
That dude from all those movies.

341
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:00,092
那时他叫做Marvin Candle
Only back then, he was called Marvin Candle.

342
00:25:00,092 --> 00:25:02,038
听起来像什么  别名吗

343
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:04,069
那名字叫  我不想讨论这个
What part of "I don't want to talk about it"

344
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:07,023
既然你不想讨论  那你为什么告诉我呢
Well, if you didn't want to talk about it, why'd you tell me?

345
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,057
你知道他是你父亲多久了
How long have you known he was your dad?

346
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:14,026
我们到这儿的第三天  我在餐厅排队
The third day we were here, I was on line at the cafeteria,

347
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:15,082
而我母亲排在我后面
And my mother got in line behind me.

348
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:18,039
那是我第一个线索
That was my first clue.

349
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:22,044
但是达摩组织的那些人最后都死了
But all those Dharma dudes end up dead.

350
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,041
难道你不想救他吗
Don't you wanna... save him?

351
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,053
我救不了他
I can't save him.

352
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,068
不管我如何补救  他们都会杀了他
They're gonna get kill no matter what I do,

353
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,037
那么何必麻烦呢
So why bother?

354
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:33,044
我要你们送我去Radzinsky的工作地点
I need you to take me to Radzinsky at the work site

尸体是怎么处理的呢
What happened to the body?

360
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,001
哪有尸体
What body?

361
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:01,081
该我来打扫这间子  你在这干什么呢
This room is on my rounds. What are you doing here?

362
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,034
我以为来替你的班

我听说了你儿子的事

哪部分呢  是他中了枪

365
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:13,010
还是在医务室被绑架呢
Or that someone kidnapped him from the infirmary?

366
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,052
那你还来这儿干活
Then what are you doing here at work?

367
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:17,008
我还能干什么呢
What else am I gonna do?

368
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:21,039
坐在一边祈祷那群笨蛋会找到我孩子吗
Sit around and pray that those idiots are gonna find my boy?

369
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:26,025
你可以走了
So you can get outta here.

370
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,098
你和那个叫Kate的女人
You came in here a couple days

对
Yeah.

373
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:48,072
你了解她吗
You know her at all?

374
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:51,012
为什么这么问呢
Why?

375
00:26:51,072 --> 00:26:53,006
因为她说了些
'cause she's got some...

376
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,056
怪异的话  关于我的孩子
Kinda weird thing for my kid.

377
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,066
先是她出现医务室里
First, she shows up at the infirmary

378
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,087
给我孩子输血
And gave him blood.

379
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,025
然后当他失踪后
But then when he goes missing,

380
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:04,026
她却过来跟我说
She comes to me and she says,

381
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:08,006
别担心  你孩子会没事的
"Don't worry. He's gonna be okay."

382
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:12,023
我想告诉你
I'm gonna tell you somethin', man.

383
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,078
我开始认为
I'm beginning to think

384
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:16,086
她可能和这些事情有关
That she's got something to do with this.

385
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:22,001
我该去找Horace
I should go to Horace,

386
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,083
举报她
Report her.

387
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:27,088
你说呢
What do you think?

388
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:32,076
我想 呃  Roger
I think, Roger, that, uh,

389
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,008
你今天很倒霉
That you've had a hell of a day, and that's...

390
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,038
所以你喝醉了酒
Given you a very good excuse to go out and get drunk.

391
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:44,017
才想出这些荒唐的事
Maybe that's put some...some crazy ideas into your head.

392
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:47,026
我了解那个女人  Kate
I know that woman, Kate.

393

她是我朋友
She's my friend,

394
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:52,000
她也绝不会去伤害你儿子
And she would never do anything to hurt your son.

395
00:27:53,063 --> 00:27:54,075
应该吧
Sure.

396
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:20,063
我是新来了  张博士
So I'm new here, Dr. Chang.

- What is it exactly you do at the orchid? - It's classified.

398
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:26,022

Oh, really? You can't tell anyone?

399
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:27,015
即使是你老婆
Not even your wife?

400
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:28,062
不能
No.

401
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:30,068
那告诉你的孩子吗
What about your kids?

402
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:35,054
我儿子才三个月大  所以我还没告诉他
I have a 3-monthld son, so, no, I haven't told him.

403
00:28:35,054 --> 00:28:37,059

00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:54,046
我老婆喜欢
My wife is.

412
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:56,023
我喜欢乡村乐
I like country.

413
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,050
你们俩来这里有三年了吧
So you two have been here for... three years now.

414
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,098
关系应该很亲密吧
Must be pretty tight, huh?

415
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:11,004
我和张博士不在同一个生活圈
Dr. chang and I... don't exactly travel in the same circles.

416
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:13,078
我不知道有哪些生活圈
I wasn't aware there were circles.

417
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:15,036
太好了
Great.

418
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:18,085
我们应该抽空一起去喝几杯
We should all... get together for a beer sometime.

419
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:20,027
这主意很酷吧
How awesome would that be happy?

420
00:29:24,024 --> 00:29:25,020
这儿停一下
Stop here.

421
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:58,078
你们不必等我了  我和Radzinsky回去
You don't need to wait. I'll get a ride back with Radzinsky.

422
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:03,007
老兄  这是什么地方
Dude, what is this place?

423
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:04,037
这么隐蔽干什么呢
And what's up with all the secrecy?

424
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:06,085
我不知道  也不关心
Don't know. Don't care.

425
00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:13,053
喂  Glenn
Hey, Glenn!

426
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:17,009
积载表上的序列号说多少呢
What's the serial number that goes on the hatch list?

427
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:19,049
4  8...
4, 8...

428
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,044
15...
15...

429
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:30,015
16...
16...

430
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,052
23...
23...

431
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:38,086
等一会  纸有些脏
Hold on a minute. it's smudged.

432
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,049
-42  -42
- 42. - 42.

433
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:43,029
你是怎么知道的呢
How the hell did you know that?

434
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:47,046
因为他们在造我们的舱
'cause they're building our hatch.

435
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,087
什么舱呢
What hatch?

436
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,033
弄得我们坠机的那个舱
The one that crashed our plane.

437
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,052
谢谢
Thanks.

438
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,001
嘿  Miles
Hey, miles.

439
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,024
我们认识吗
Do I know you?

440
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,012
Miles  我叫Bram
Miles, my name's Bram.

441
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:28,082
你欠我一份烤鱼卷
You owe me a fish taco.

442
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:31,038
很抱歉  但他们在监视你的公寓
Sorry about that, but your apartment's being watched,

443
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:33,014
我们在尽全力来
And we had to try our best

444
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:35,064
说服你不要为Charle Widmore工作
To talk you out of working for Charles Widmore.

445
00:31:36,014 --> 00:31:37,044
我不知道那是谁
I have no idea who that is.

446
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:40,070
他特别资助的一艘船
He's the man

447
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,097
而你下周就要参加船员
Who chartered the boat you'll be getting on next week.

448
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:46,093
朋友  你不会想上那条船
And, my friend, you do not want to get on that boat.

449
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:50,022
你知道雕像的阴影里藏着什么吗
Do you know what lies in the shadow of the statue?

450
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:53,097
不知道
No, can't say that I do.

451
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:56,029
那就说明你没准备好去那座岛
Then you're not ready to go to that island.

452
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:58,049
但如果你跟我们一起
But if you come with us--

453
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,020
你会发现你毕生寻找的答案
All those things you've spent your life trying to find out?

454
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:03,005
你全会知道的
You'll know.

455
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,025
你会知道你到底是谁  Miles
You'll know who you are, Miles

456
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,010
为什么你有那种能力
Why it is you have a gift,

457
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:11,004
更重要的是
And most of all,

458
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:12,084
你会知道你父亲
You'll know about your father.

459
00:32:16,073 --> 00:32:19,004
我不知道你从哪得到的情报
I don't know where you've been getting your intel,

460
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:22,082
但我很久之前就不关心我的父亲了
But I stopped caring about my father a long time ago.

461
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:25,092
我关心的仅仅是钱
What I do care about is money.

462
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,016
我告诉你为什么
So I'll tell you what.

463
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:31,009
你要我不去小岛
You want me to pass on going to the island?

464
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,022
那你得给我他们愿意付的钱的双倍
It's gonna cost you double what they offered

465
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:34,081
320万美元
$3.2 million.

466
00:32:35,057 --> 00:32:37,057
我们不会付给你任何东西
We're not paying you anything.

467
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:40,073
就算有这世上所有的钱
But all the money in the world

468
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:44,010
也无法填补你内心对你父亲所失去的感觉 Miles
Isn't gonna fill that empty hole inside you, Miles.

469
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,038
这很伤人心  不是吗
That's sad, isn't it?

470
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:51,093
把他扔下去
Toss him!

471
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,043
你选错边了
You're playing for the wrong team.

472
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,017
那你这又是什么队伍啊
Yeah? What team are you on?

473
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:02,068
一个稳赢的队伍
The one that's gonna win.

474
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,016
他们在建的那舱
That hatch they're building?

475
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,073
将会发生场事故的
There's gonna be an accident,

476
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:20,008
然后他们还会安个计算机
Then they're gonna have to build a computer

477
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:22,079
有个按钮  你必须按  不然这世界将会毁灭
With a button you have to push so the world doesn't end.

478
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:27,024
你爸爸
So your dad...

479
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:29,063
他还在...
Is he around...

480
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:33,009
...我们来的时间 未来
You know, when we came from? the future?

481
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:34,051
不
No.

482
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:37,089
这对你来讲不是很棒
Well, then this is kind of awesome for you, huh?

483
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:38,094
怎么会让我觉得很棒
How is it awesome?!

484
00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:40,076
因为你可以和他经常在一起
Because you get to hang out with him,

485
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:42,058
你可以了解更多有关他的东西
You know, get to know him better and stuff.

486
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:44,007
不用谢我了
And don't bother thanking me,

487
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:45,080
但他完全沉湎于啤酒中了  老兄
But he was totally down for that beer, dude.

488
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,015
也许他会让你抱着婴儿时期的你
You know, and maybe he'll let you hold baby you,

489
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:51,088
给你自己换尿布或者...
Or you can change your own diaper or--

490
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:54,076
听清楚
Listen up,

491
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,076
这种谈话仅此一次
'cause we're only gonna have this conversation once.

492
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:59,019
我不想和我爸一起
I don't want to hang out with my dad.

493
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:02,026
我不想更了解他  或者"其它的事"
I don't want to know him better and "stuff."

494
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:03,035
为什么不想
Why not?

495
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,065
你小的时候他一直打你吗
Did he beat you up when you were little or something?

496
00:34:05,065 --> 00:34:08,051
我小的时候他甚至都不在我身边  你这傻子
He wasn't even around when I was little, you dimwit!

497
00:34:08,082 --> 00:34:11,010
我现在才对他有所了解
I never knew him until now.

498
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,099
我怎么会告诉你这些
Why am I even telling you this?

499
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,086
因为你很痛苦  你想摆脱这种痛苦
'cause you're in pain and you need to let it out.

500
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,068
我不痛苦  这无关紧要
I'm not in pain. it doesn't matter.

501
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:23,066
我爸死了  他离开了  他从不关心我
My father is dead. he's gone. he never cared about me,

502
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:26,063
我无法去改变这种状况
And nothing I can do will ever change that.

503
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:30,033
但他没死  我们刚刚才把他放下车
But he's not gone. we just dropped him off.

504
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:32,045
你想扯入我家这事吗
You want to get into my business?

505
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:35,004
-管好你自己的事吧  -把这书还给我
- Let's get into yours!  - Give that back to me.

506
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:37,013
-让我读下这日记怎样  -这不是日记  是隐私
- How about we read your little diary?  -It's not a diary! It's personal!!

507
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:39,035
看看在这比你生命还重要的书里有些什么
Let's see what's going on in that piece of granite you call a head

508
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,031
把  把这个还我
Give that-- give that back to me.

509
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,043
-还给我  -在胡斯(星战里的星球)的外部
- Give it back!  - "exterior--hoth.

510
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:48,003
"一个小型机械人飞速从外太空降落"
"a little spy robot thingy zips through the atmosphere

511
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,071
"撞上了这颗白雪皑皑的星球"
"and crashes into the snowy planet below.

512
00:34:50,098 --> 00:34:53,041
"这时Chewbacca常出现了
"that's when Chewbacca shows up

513
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:56,016
用他的激光箭把它给炸毁了"
and blasts it away with his crossbow laser.

514
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:59,039
"他摇动着他的'匹'拳在空中挥舞"
"he shakes his fury fist in the sky in triumph.

515
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:00,096
Chewbacca--raaar."

516
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:04,021
是"毛"
It's "furry."

517
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:08,030
"毛拳"  我要检查下拼写了
"furry fist." I need to spell-check it.

518
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,091
这是什么鬼东西
What the hell is this?

519
00:35:14,004 --> 00:35:15,090
我在写"帝国反击战"
I'm writing "empire strikes back."

520
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:18,058
不好意思  什么东西
Uh... I'm sorry. what?

521
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:20,024
1977年  对吧
It's 1977, right?

522
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:23,018
《星球大战》刚上映
So "Stars Wars" just came out.

523
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:24,053
很快  George Lucas
And pretty soon, George Lucas

524
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:26,029
就会找寻续集的剧本
is gonna be looking for a sequel.

525
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:28,029
我看了《帝国》差不多200次了
I've seen "empire," like, 200 times,

526
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,036
所以我在想
So I figured

527
00:35:29,036 --> 00:35:31,092
让事情变简单点  把构思送给他
I'd make life easier and send him the script...

528
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:34,076
顺便帮他改良一下
With a couple improvements.

529
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:38,059
这是我有生以来见到过的最蠢的事
That has gotta be the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

530
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,048
是吗
Oh, yeah?

531
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,054
至少我不怕和我父亲谈话
Well, at least I'm not scared to talk to my own dad.

532
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,092
-James  你回来了  -差不多吧
- James. you're back. - Barely.

533
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:57,064
回想起当时你还记得
You ever had one of those days you feel like

534
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:59,049
那个荷兰小男孩把你的手指...
The little Dutch boy with your finger in the...

535
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,058
大夫  你好啊
Doc. hey.

536
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:06,092
发生什么事了
What's going on?

537
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:10,025
Ben的父亲认为Kate和他儿子的失踪
Ben's father thinks that Kate had something to do

538
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,049
有关
with his son going missing.

539
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,049
他怎么会这样想
Why the hell would he think that?

540
00:36:15,023 --> 00:36:18,025
因为她和他聊过天  希望能让他好受点
Because she talked to him, tried to make him feel better.

541
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:22,004
她的心地是很好的
Her heart was in the right place.

542
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:23,049
可是她真的很没脑
Yeah, well, where was her head?

543
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:26,030
我和Roger谈过了
I had a talk with Roger.

544
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,040
我认为他还没和别人说过任何事
I don't think he's gonna say anything to anyone for now.

545
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:31,069
我只是想让你知道
I just wanted you to know.

546
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:41,049
-谢谢你告诉我这些  大夫  -不客气
-Thanks for filling me in, doc.  - No problem.

547
00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:54,007
老板
Hey, boss.

548
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,087
我们有些情况  你最好来一趟办公室吧
We got a development. you better come to the office.

549
00:36:58,012 --> 00:37:00,039
Phil  我一整天都在丛林中东奔西走着
Phil, I've been running around the jungle all day,

550
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:02,063
所以无论有什么情况都应该让我休息下
So whatever developments you got can wait a while.

551
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:03,091
我知道谁带走了小孩
I know who took the kid.

552
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,064
是谁
Yeah? who's that?

553
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:15,013
是你
You.

554
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:18,071
我能解释清楚
Got a perfectly good explanation for what you saw on that tape.

555
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:20,029
那就说吧
I sure as hell hope so.

556
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:26,050
你和Horace谈过了没
You talk to Horace yet?

557
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,026
没  我认为经过三年的共事
No. I thought that after three years of working together,

558
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:31,002
你不会亏待我的
I'd give you the benefit of the doubt--

559
00:37:34,028 --> 00:37:35,045
拿绳子来
Get some rope.

560
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,011
Gray先生
Mr. Gray?

561
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:50,099
希望你别介意  大门开着的
I hope you don't mind. your gate was open.

562
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,063
Straume先生  没问题的  不要紧
Mr. Straume. of course. of course. no problem.

563
00:37:55,004 --> 00:37:56,053
你怎么来了
What, uh, what brings you by?

564
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,074
先生
Well, sir, uh...

565
00:38:00,026 --> 00:38:03,007
我就要去乘船旅行段时间了
I'm about to go on a boat trip for a while,

566
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:05,081
另外...
And...

567
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,020
我要把这个还给你
I wanted to give this back to you

568
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,097
我欺骗了你  Gray先生
I lied to you, Mr. Gray.

569
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:23,006
我无法和你儿子对话
I wasn't able to talk to your son.

570
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,028
你为什么告诉我这些
Why are you telling me this?

571
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:32,058
你完全可以让我深信你之前说的那些话
You could have just let me go on believing what you said.

572
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:37,052
-那对你的儿子很不公平  -什么意思
- That wouldn't have been fair to your son. - I'm sorry?

573
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:43,087
如果你想让你儿子知道你深爱着他
If you needed your son to know that you loved him,

574
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:46,066
你应该在他还活着的时候就告诉他
You should've told him when he was still alive.

575
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:19,077
我说你害怕跟你父亲说话  对此我很抱歉
Sorry I said you were afraid to talk to our dad, dude.

576
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,079
别放在心上
Don't worry about it.

577
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:25,056
我以前也曾恨过我爸
I used to hate my dad, too.

578
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,010
在我10岁的时候他离开了
He left when I was 10.

579
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:35,005
但好在我给了他第二次机会
But the best thing I ever did was give him a second chance.

580
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:37,076
我们成为了最好的朋友
We got to be the best of friends,

581
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:39,086
尽管我有可能再也见不到他了
And although I may never see him again,

582
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:42,017
我很想念他
I miss him.

583
00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:44,075
而且我知道一样会在想我的
And I know he feels the same.

584
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:47,067
我爸爸不是在我10岁的时候离开的
My dad didn't leave when I was 10.

585
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:51,035
我那时还是个婴儿  我不记得他了
I-I was a baby. I never knew him.

586
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,006
我也不想记得他
And I don't want to.

587
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:55,072
就是这样子
It's that happening.

588
00:39:56,087 --> 00:39:58,057
那是Luke的态度
That was Luke's attitude,too.

589
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:01,009
什么意思
What?

590
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:05,039
在《帝国》里  Luke发现Vader是他的父亲
In "empire," Luke found out Vader was his father,

591
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:07,094
但没有拿开他的光剑
But instead of putting away his lightsaber

592
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:09,005
让大家有一个交流的机会
And talking about it,

593
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:11,051
反而因为反应过度把他的手给切断了
He overreacted and got his hand cut off.

594
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:16,080
我是说  他们最后还是和解了  但代价很大
I mean, they worked it out eventually, but at what cost?

595
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:18,073
另外颗死星被摧毁了
Another death star was destroyed,

596
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:20,074
Boba Fett被Sarlacc给吃掉了
Boba Fett got eaten by the Sarlacc,

597
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:22,032
然后出现了Ewoks族人
And we got the Ewoks.

598
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:24,023
这些都可以避免
It all could've been avoided

599
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:27,090
如果他们能有所交流
If they'd just, you know, communicated.

600
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,024
面对这些  Ewoks不是东西  老兄
And let's face it. the Ewoks sucked, dude.

601
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,065
你好  等一下
Hello? Oh, one moment.

602
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,098
是找你的
It's for you.

603
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,029
Miles吗  我需要你
Miles? I need you.

604
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,012
你需要我?
You do?

605
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:40,040
潜艇从总部开来了
Sub's here from H.Q.

606
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,077
我需要你把他们带回来
I need your help bringing them in.

607
00:41:42,014 --> 00:41:43,046
好的  是新成员吗
Sure. new recruits?

608
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:45,083
不是的  是从安娜堡市来的科学家
No, uh, scientists from Ann Arbor.

609
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:48,000
去开车吧  我们去码头
Get your van, and let's get to the dock.

610
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:03,070
要帮忙吗
Hey, can I get a hand with this?

611
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,004
好的
Yeah, yeah, sure.

612
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:18,037
-Dan  -你好啊  Miles
- Dan.  - Hey, Miles.

613
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:22,072
好久不见了
Long time no see.
