I don't understand it any more than you do.

145
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:53,065
但是他们确实就在这里
But they're here,

146
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:56,015
趁还没人发现他们
And I gotta find a way to bring 'em in

147
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,016
趁他们还没毁掉咱们在这里的成果
Before somebody else finds 'em

148
00:10:58,018 --> 00:11:00,072
我得找个方法把他们带回来
and they screw up everything we got here.

149
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:08,016
今天下午  有个潜艇要来
There's,um,a sub coming in this afternoon.

150
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:36,035
你学没学过敲门
You understand the concept of knocking?

151
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:47,028
把你脏手拿开
Get your hands off that!

152
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,045
我记得你听得懂英语 我说把手拿开
I thought you learned English. I said,hands off!

153
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:54,025
除了我  任何人都不许碰这个站的任何装置
Nobody handles any of the gear in this station except me.

154
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:55,058
明不明白
Understand?

155
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:58,002
我得查查雷达日志
I need to check the radar logs.

156
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,048
查它干嘛
For what?

157
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,055
求你了 我得弄清楚有没有飞机降落在岛上
Please. I need to know if a plane landed on the island.

158
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,086
有没有飞机降落?落到这儿?
If a plane landed? Here?

159
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,095
是
Yes.

160
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:12,052
什么意思  你觉得要是有飞机降落到咱们岛上
What,so you think if a plane landed on our island,

161
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:14,085
我还能像没事儿一样搭模型吗
I'd be over there just building my model?

162
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,082
我还能谁都不通知吗
That I wouldn't have called anyone?

163
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:18,089
我还能不拉警报吗
That I wouldn't have put out an alert?

164
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:20,026
也可能你没看到
Maybe you missed it.

165
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:21,059
能不能跟别的站确认一下
Can you check with the other stations?

166
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:24,052
我刚才跟你说了  我不可能
I just told you I would not be...

167
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:29,006
跟别的站问问
Check with the other stations.

168
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,015
所有站点请注意
Attention all stations,

169
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,034
火焰站Radzinsky
This is a system-wide broadcast

170
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,049
向全网广播
From Radzinsky at the Flame.

171
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:46,002
我想查找
I'm checking in

172
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:48,086
是否有人看到有飞机降落本岛
To see if anyone's seen an airplane over the island.

173
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,025
目前没人发现飞机
No one else has seen an airplane,

174
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,089
但是你要真看到了  请联系我  完毕
But if you have,could you call in to me,please? Over.

175
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,052
你这么着急到底是因为什么  Kwon
So what are you all hot and bothered about,Kwon?

176
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:01,080
这架飞机怎么就这么重要吗
Why is this plane so damn important?

177
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:06,043
反正就重要
It just is.

178
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,072
你在找人吗
Did you lose someone?

179
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,062
什么意思
Excuse me?

180
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,059
我看你四处张望
I just saw you looking around.

181
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:40,086
我想  你可能在找飞机上的人
I thought maybe you lost someone on the plane.

182
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,019
没有
No.

183
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,065
我自己上的飞机
I was traveling alone.

184
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:46,065
大家能不能听我说两句
Can I get everybody's attention?!

185
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,099
大伙请听我说
Everybody,please!

186
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,023
大家好好听
Listen up,folks!

187
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,099
我们现在处境是
Here's where we're at.

188
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:00,062
无线电失灵
The radio's dead,

189
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,012
所以我至今无法报告咱们的情况
So I haven't been able to call in our situation.

190
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:04,056
但是没关系
But that's all right.

191
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:05,094
他们一旦发现
Soon as they figure out

192
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,034
我们不在预定地点
We're not where we're supposed to be,

193
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:09,030
他们会展开搜索
They'll come looking for us.

194
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:13,046
所以现在最佳做法  就是聚集在一起
So best thing to do right now is just stick together.

195
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,033
待在一块儿  不要乱走
Stick together, hunker down

196
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:18,008
-等待救援到来  - 这是哪里
- And just wait till help gets here. - And where is here?

197
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:22,012
-什么  -这是哪里  这是什么地方
- What's that? - Where is here? What is this place?

198
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,005
我也不知道这是什么地方
I don't know where "here" is

199
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:27,052
因为我航空图上没有这个岛
Because this island's not on my charts.

200
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,065
真的吗
Really?

201
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,019
真的
Really.

202
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:33,053
那边有几处房屋
Because there are some buildings over there...

203
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:36,016
还有牲畜的笼子
And animal cages

204
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,005
就能看见对面有个更大的岛
You can see a bigger island across the water.

205
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,089
那你就去那边找张新航空图吧
So maybe you should get some new charts.

206
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,056
眼下
Right now,

207
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,013
我要做的就是保证大家安全
I'm just trying to keep everyone here safe.

208
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:50,012
所以大家先收集些柴火吧
So let's gather up some firewood.

209
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:53,036
他想等  就让他自己等吧
If he wants to wait,let him!

210
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,076
我提议大家去查看一下那些房子
I say we search these buildings!

211
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,026
说不定他们有无线电  还有吃的
Maybe they have a radio or some food!

212
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,006
谁愿意来帮我
Who wants to help me?!

213
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,071
为什么跟踪我
Why are you following me?

214
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:48,075
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

215
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,091
回我们自己的岛
Back to our island.

216
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:56,005
你也想来吗
You wanna come?

217
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:10,089
Juliet
Juliet?

218
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:12,065
嗨  Amy
Hey, Amy.

219
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:16,002
-不好意思  我不是故意吵醒你的  - 不  没关系
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. - Oh,no,it's fine.

220
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:18,088
我来拿潜水艇人员名单
I just came to get the sub manifest.

221
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:22,018
-显然  我今天不想让你操劳  -谢谢你
- Obviously, I don't want you working today. - Thank you.

222
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:27,012
-满员了?  -差不多
- Full load? - Almost.

223
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:30,008
有两名队员在最后时刻退出了
Two of the recruits dropped out in the eleventh hour.

224
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:32,062
他们不愿在旅途中注射镇静剂
They didn't want to take the sedative for the trip.

225
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:35,082
能帮我看看Pierre吗
Can you tell Pierre for me?

226
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:41,002
你好  小家伙
Hello,little one.

227
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,098
你和Horace想好名字了吗
Have you and Horace decided on a name?

228
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:49,072
想好了  我们给他起名Ethan
Yeah,we have. We're gonna name him Ethan.

229
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:59,052
你好  小朋友
Oh,hey,buddy.

230
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,092
你和Jim什么时候也要个孩子
So... when are you and Jim gonna have one of these?

231
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:09,008
我不知道
I don't know.

232
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,035
等到时机成熟
Timing's gotta be right.

233
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:26,015
告诉你怎么回来的那个女的
So the woman who told you how to come back...

234
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:29,066
告没告诉你会回到30年前
Did she mention that it would be 30 years ago?

235
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:33,035
没  没说  她没提这个
No. No, she left that part out.

236
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:38,019
那我们现在该怎么办
So what are we supposed to do now?

237
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:43,012
我也不知道
I'm not sure yet.

238
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:45,085
Sawyer回来了
Sawyer's back!

239
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:01,085
好了  听着  你们要装成
All right,listen. Y'all are gonna be

240
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,025
坐潜艇来的第二批队员
The second batch of recruits comin' in off the sub

241
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:06,061
潜艇马上就进港了  我们时间很紧
Pullin' into port right about now, so we ain't got much time.

242
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:09,081
西装不错啊  大夫  可惜不适合岛上穿  试试这个
Nice suit,doc. Not exactly island wear. Try this.

243
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,041
你让我们说自己是坐潜艇来的
You want us to say we came in on the sub.

244
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,095
管用吗
How's that gonna work?

245
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:15,091
他们来的时候都被麻醉了
Everyone gets knocked out before the trip,

246
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:19,045
所以我们下手之前  他们根本不认识对方
So no one meets each other until we process 'em.

247
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,042
听着  我们得找到飞机上其他人
Look,we need to find the rest of the people from the plane.

248
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:24,041
如果飞机在这  Jin会找到的
If there was a plane, Jin will find it.

249
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:26,065
我们大概有10分钟时间对口供
So we got about ten minutes to make intake,

250
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,085
不然你们就要在丛林里长期扎营
Or y'all are gonna be camping in the jungle for a long time.

251
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:32,071
6个月之内不会有下一批雇员来
There ain't another batch of recruits due in for six months.

252
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:36,036
你们觉得如何
What do you think?

253
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:38,035
我觉得我们应该听Sawyer的
I think we should listen to Sawyer.

254
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,051
-我投票给不野营  -相信我
- I vote for not camping. - Trust me.

255
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:43,058
照我说的做  一切都没问题
Do what I say. Everything will be fine.

256
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:49,065
咱们走吧
Let's move.

257
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:56,045
刚接到潜望镜站电话
I just heard from the Looking Glass.

258
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:58,071
他们是最后一个打进来的站点
They were the last station to check in.

259
00:18:58,074 --> 00:19:01,084
除了即将进站的潜艇  什么都没有
They got nothing but an incoming sub.

260
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:06,031
要不你先回家 有事我给你打电话
Why don't you go home, And I'll call you if something happens?

261
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:12,085
走开  走开  别挡我路
Move. Move. Out of my way.

262
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,012
-那群混蛋  -你看到什么了
- Those bastards. - What do you see?

263
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:18,084
坐标325  动力传感警报被触发
Grid 325. Motion sensor alarm was tripped.

264
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:20,067
我们附近有敌人
We got a hostile inside the perimeter.

265
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:25,099
你要去哪儿
Where you going?!

266
00:19:57,075 --> 00:20:00,001
站住别动
Stop right there!

267
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:10,042
Sayid
Sayid?

268
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:13,094
Jin
Jin?

269
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:17,018
Sun在哪儿
Where's Sun?

270
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:20,004
我也不知道
I don't know.

271
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:21,048
闭嘴
Shut up!

272
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:26,011
蹲下
Get down!

273
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:29,008
再敢说一个字  老子毙了你
Say another word, and you're dead.

274
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:43,072
好吧  现在是1977年
Okay, so it's 1977.

275
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,018
对
Yep.

276
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:48,068
而且  你们都是达摩的人
And... you guys are all members of the Dharma initiative.

277
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:50,092
对
Yep.

278
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:56,024
那你也知道这些人后来都被屠杀了  对吧
Well,you do realize those dudes get wiped out,right?

279
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,049
我是说  你见过那个万人坑
I mean,I saw the pit where all the bodies got dumped.

280
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:01,069
-什么  -你不想吗
-what about it? -well,aren't you gonna warn 'em?

281
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:03,092
你不想在事情发生前去制止它吗
aren't you gonna stop it from happening?

282
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,039
我不是来给他们算命的
i ain't here to play nostradamus to these people.

283
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,035
而且Faraday知道一些有趣的规矩
besides,Faraday's got some interesting theories

284
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:10,072
告诉我们哪些能做  哪些不能做

so when you get in there, just watch the little meet and greet video,

290
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:58,017
当他们叫你的名字时  笑着走上前
wait for 'em to call your name. when they do,just smile,

291
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,022
领取制服和工作任务

just remembe to act a little doped up, 'cause you just woke up from the sub.

295
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,040
如果他们问及一些我们无法回答的问题怎么办
What if they start asking us questions we can't answer,

296
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,012
-就像  1977年的总统  -这不是游戏  Hugo
-like,uh, who's president in 1977? -it's not a damn game show,hugo.

Radzinksy看着他呢
radzinksy's taking care of him now.

312
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,092
他来我们领地干什么
what's he doing in our territory?

313
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:13,088
这是破坏休战协定的行为

326
00:23:57,088 --> 00:24:03,068
Jin是在 那个主岛上吗

327
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,043
老实说我不知道

338
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:49,012
难道你真的相信这个家伙
you don't think you can really trust this guy,do ya?

339
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:57,018

Sun  之前我乘坐的那条船

上面都是一群

346
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:32,002
以他为目标的突击队员
whose only mission was to get him.

347
00:25:32,004 --> 00:25:34,038
结果那些人的下场如何呢
And how'd that work out for everyone?

348
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:38,085
别去
don't do it.

349
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:43,022
为什么不跟我们一起走
why don't you come with us?

350
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,096
不行  有很多人要我照顾

there's a small dock about a half mile due south across the water.

355
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:58,048

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:34,036
-他不能丢下我们独处  -交给我了
-he won't leave us alone. -i got this.

422
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:40,010
-他在哪  -关在仓库里了
-where is he? -locked in the storage room.

423
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:41,077
把钥匙给我
give me the key.

424
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,060
Lafleur  他看到了天鹅站的模型
you need to know,lafleur... he saw the model of the swan,

425
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,033
他可能也看到建立地点的勘测图
and he could've seen the survey of where we're building it.

426
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,053
你的意思是  他是个间谍
your point is? he's a spy.

427
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,099
一切都是在演戏
this whole thing is an act,

428
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:54,043
要么跟着他演  要么干掉他
and we either play into it or we don't.

429
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:57,035
我们现在可以结束这一切
we can end this right now.

430
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,033
你在说什么  Radzinsky
what the hell are you talking about,radzinsky?

431
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:04,006
我们杀了他
we shoot him.

432
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:10,072
好吧  你的想法非常好
well,i appreciate your input there,quick draw.

433
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:14,018
可我想先和他谈谈  把该死的钥匙给我
but i wanna talk to him first. give me the damn keys.

434
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:37,073
我叫  Lafleur  我是安全主管
my name's lafleur. i'm head of security.

435
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:41,039
我要你仔细听好我说的
i want you to listen real carefully to what i got to say.

436
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:44,033
照做的话  你就不会有事
and if you do that, you'll be fine.

437
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:45,065
明白吗
understand?

438
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:51,019
好吧  我就不废话了
all right, let's start simple.

439
00:30:51,022 --> 00:30:53,024
你要自视为我方的敌人
identify yourself as a hostile.

440
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:57,042
按照休战协定里所提到的
the terms of the truce say

441
00:30:57,046 --> 00:31:01,013
你必须承认你敌人的身份
you gotta identify yourself as a hostile,

442
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:03,072
否则我们就有权杀掉你
or we got the right to shoot you.

443
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:07,052
我们不认为我们是敌人
We do not refer ourselves as hostile

444
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:10,077
不过很对  我和他们是一伙的
but yes,i-i am one of them.

445
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:15,032
很好
all right. good.

446
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:17,039
接下来我们大可友好相待
now we can proceed like a couple of gtlemen.

447
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,005
好吧  我们走
all right,let's go.

448
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:21,038
带他去兵营
just taking him back to the barracks.

449
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,092
如果你带他走  我必须跟着
oh,if you're taking him in, then i'm coming with you.

450
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,002
这是大错特错
this is a horrible mistake.

451
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:28,093
-我要直接和Horace报告  -随你便
-i'm gonna talk directly to horace about this. -fine. talk away.

452
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:44,080
你能说说我们这是在干什么吗
you wanna remind me why the hell we're doing this?

453
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:48,024
Ben  说如果我老公在岛上
ben said if my husband is on the isle,

454
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:49,096
那就最好从这里开始找
the best place to start looking for him is here.

455
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:52,038
我明白了  在你重打他头之前
i see, that's some advice you took

456
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:54,089
他还给了你一些建议
before you whacked him in the head.

457
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:23,059
你看到了没
Tell me you saw that

458
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:29,059
可能只是什么动物
probably just an animal.

459
00:32:29,062 --> 00:32:31,009
动物  好吧
animal. right.

460
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:53,035
Sun  我很抱歉这样讲
i'm sorry to say,sun, but.

461
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,081
我觉得我们在这里找不到你丈夫
i don't think we're gonna find your husband here.

462
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:58,066
或许我们应该直接回去
maybe we oughta just head back.

463
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:31,028
你好
hello.

464
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:33,056
你是谁
who the hell are you?

465
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,002
我叫 Christian 
my name's christian.

466
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:41,066
我在找我丈夫  他名字叫  Jin Gwon
i'm looking for my husband. his name is jin Gwon.

467
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:43,075
你知道他在哪里吗
do you know where he is?

468
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,076
跟我走
follow me.

469
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:11,016
这是哪里

470
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:14,062
76  78

471
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:16,045

472
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:18,059
找到了  77

473
00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:21,006
他在

474
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,001
他和你的朋友在一起
he's with your friends.

475
00:34:25,006 --> 00:34:27,006
你在说什么  什么朋友
what are you talking about? what friends?

476
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:44,099
很遗憾  你得花些精力才能找到他
i'm sorry,but you have a bit of a journey ahead of you.

477
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,019
好 准备
okay,ready?

478
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:56,006
大家一起说  吉祥
everybody say,"namaste!"

479
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,052
吉祥

00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:58,079

482
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:04,037
非常好 你们...可以利用剩下的几天熟悉
right on. so you...guys have the rest of the day to get acquainted with

483
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:06,081
新住处的安全守则
your security protocol handbooks waitin' in your new digs.

484
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:09,045
有些讲的比较吓人  但我向你们保证
now some of it may seem a little scary,but i promise you all,

485
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:10,095
我们非常安全  好吧
we are perfectly safe here, okay?

486
00:35:10,095 --> 00:35:11,068
所以在这里别见外
so make yourselves at home.

487
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:16,057
-我们什么都有 一应俱全  -能听到吗  Phil

-我们带来了个犯人  -收到  Lafeur
-we're coming in with a fourteen-j. roger that,mr. lafleur.

489
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,074
好的   大家靠后站
okay,if i could get everyone to hold back,please,

490
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:39,074
我们有点安全上的小问题
we have a minor security situation.

491
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:46,038
走

492
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:00,035
我想我们找到  Sayid  了
i guess we found sayid.

493
00:36:18,062 --> 00:36:21,089
你就在老实这里呆着  等我们决定怎么处置你
all right,you can hang out here until we can figure out what to do with you.

494
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:24,062
我们怎么处置他
what are we gonna do with him?

495
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:30,052
给他弄点吃的 我们不是野蛮人

496
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,029
打扰
ah,excuse me.

497
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:52,052
你能告诉我  James Lafleur  住哪里吗
could you tell me where james lafleur lives?

498
00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:54,099
那是他的房子
uh,that's his house right there.

499
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:56,065
谢谢
thanks.

500
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:02,029
我不叫他  James
but i wouldn't call him "james."

501
00:37:02,032 --> 00:37:04,075
他比较反感
he hates it.

502
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:34,034
Jack
hey,jack.

503
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,071
我今天早些时候见过你
i saw you earlier today

504
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:43,072
当时你在帮Kate我当时想和你聊聊 可是
when you were helping kate, and i wanted to say something to you then,but...

505
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:46,062
我们不该彼此相识
we're not supposed to know each other.

506
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:48,009
是啊
yeah. yeah.

507
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:57,049
-我在找Sawyer我想我来错房间了  -不 进来
-i was looking for sawyer.i guess i came to the wrong house.-no. come in.

508
00:38:03,085 --> 00:38:05,079
晚上好  医生
evening,doc.

509
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,045
我想你们一定有很多话要说
well,i'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.

510
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:22,025
放松点
take a load off.

511
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:24,022
喝点啤酒吗
you want a beer?

512
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:26,079
不  不用了
no. no,i'm fine.

513
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:33,015
我能帮你点什么  Jack
what can i do for you, jack?

514
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:40,066
我不知道该从何讲起
i don't even know where to start. uh...

515
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:43,013
那就谈谈  Sayid  吧
how about with sayid?

516
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:44,079
我没的选择
i had no choice.

517
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,076
他在丛林中流窜
he was running around in the jungle,

518
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,002
被人抓了起来
got caught by my people.

519
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:52,003
他看起来不能自我开脱
and seein' as how he can't tell the truth about how he got here,

520
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:55,060
-我得临时编造  -编造吗
-i had to improvise. -improvise?

521
00:38:56,069 --> 00:39:00,081
现在  Sayid  很安全  这是最重要的
and for now,sayid is safe, which is all that matters.

522
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:06,046
那我们该何去何从呢
so where do we go from here?

523
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:08,076
我正在想
i'm working on it.

524
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,048
真的吗  看上去你只是在看书
really? because it looked to me like you were reading a book.

525
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:18,056
我听说丘吉尔每晚会读一本书
i heard once winston churchill read a book every night,

526
00:39:18,058 --> 00:39:20,056
即使在闪电战时期
even during the blitz.

527
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:23,036
他说这样有助于思考
he said it made him think better.

528
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,076
我也想像他那样
it's how i like to run things.

529
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,059
我思考
i think.

530
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:31,006
我相信这对你来说并不重要
I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you,

531
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:33,076
以前你做事的时候
'cause back when you were calling the shots,

532
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,039
总是爱冲动
You pretty much just reacted.

533
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,062
知道吗  你不会思考  Jack
See,you didn't think, jack,

534
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:40,069
据我所知  很多人都死了
And as i recall, a lot of people ended up dead.

535
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,073
我带大家离开了小岛
I got us off the island.

536
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:49,009
可你现在在这里
But here you are...

537
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:52,002
回到了原点
Right back where you started.

538
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,046
所以我要继续读书
So i'm gonna go back to reading my book,

539
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:57,053
我会思考
And i'm gonna think,>

540
00:39:57,056 --> 00:40:00,032
这样我才能在今天救你
'cause that's how i saved your ass today.

541
00:40:00,036 --> 00:40:02,083
这样我以后才能救  Sayid
And that's how i'm gonna save sayid's tomorrow.

542
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:08,038
你该回家  好好休息下
All you gotta do is go home, get a good night's rest.

543
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:10,073
让我专心做我的事
Let me do what i do.

544
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:15,044
难道不是一种解脱吗
Now ain't that a relief?

545
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:20,009
是啊
Yeah.

546
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:06,041
Phil
Hey,phil.

547
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:10,013
我进去送个三明治
I'm just gonna go in there and deliver him a sandwich.

548
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:11,064
好的
All right.

549
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,007
我给你带了个三明治
I brought you a sandwich.

550
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:41,007
我没放芥末
I didn't put mustard on it,

551
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:44,024
如果你需要  我能给你弄点
But if you'd like some, i could get some

552
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:49,021
这就挺好  谢谢你
This will be fine. thanyou.

553
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:53,047
你是敌人吗
Are you a hostile?

554
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,094
你觉得我是吗
Do you think i am?

555
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:03,030
你叫什么
What's your name?

556
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:05,057
Sayid
Sayid.

557
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:07,011
你呢
