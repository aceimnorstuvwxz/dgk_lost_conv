1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,005
为什么

2
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:39,065
还有什么好讨论的

3
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:45,074
我不喜欢他

4
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:48,065
我不在乎他认识谁

5
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:53,035
我们这批货  信得过他吗

6
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:57,019
大人物

7
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:59,009
最高统帅是吧

8
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:02,030
更像是油炸师傅...

9
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,085
"炸鸡男"

10
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,015
你要干嘛都行

11
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:09,060
但必须要有我这一票才行

12
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:19,085
永远别相信南美人

13
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:22,038
他们肮脏下流

14
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:30,037
他弄坏了我的玩具

15
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:33,095
他只是在找乐子罢了

16
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:37,010
一会儿就没事

17
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,012
不  我恨他  我要他死

18
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,095
给你老叔拿瓶啤酒好吗

19
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,095
不  要冰镇的

20
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:19,050
这就是你想要的

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,037
要你兄弟死  对吧

22
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:28,057
你还得加把劲

23
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,036
如果真想救他的话

24
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:36,070
你觉得他能撑多久

25
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:41,017
一分钟  或是更久  或是更短

26
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:00,010
家人比什么都重要

27
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:56,030
绝

28
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:56,030
命

29
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:56,030
毒

30
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:56,030
师

31
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:56,030
第三季

32
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:56,030
第七集

33
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,062
喂  你可没抓住我什么把柄
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

34
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:43,056
好吧  你可以给我律师打电话  索尔·古德曼
All right, you can call my lawyer, Saul Goodman.

35
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,066
去和我律师谈  懂吗
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

36
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,070
听到了吗  我无可奉告
Hey, you hear me. I got nothing to say.

37
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,023
我告诉过你  你可以给我...
I told you. You can call my--

38
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,030
上帝啊
Ah, Christ! God!

39
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:54,057
你还搞到了我的电话号码
You had my cell phone number!

40
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,027
还知道我老婆的名字
You had my wife's name!

41
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:57,034
你是怎么知道的
How'd you do it?

42
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:00,018
你和谁一伙的
Huh? Who you working with?

43
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:25,020
如果你...准备好了要谈谈
If you're, uh, ready to talk,

44
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,013
他们要一份书面声明
they want to get a statement.

45
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:30,060
你对这里发生的一切的解释
Your side of what happened here.

46
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,091
或者我们可以拖到下次再来
Or we can hold him off till another time.

47
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,091
你可能得和律师谈谈
Maybe you'll want to talk to a lawyer.

48
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:53,036
笑一个
There it is.

49
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,073
艾德里安
Yo, Adrian.

50
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,016
史泰龙电影《洛奇》里被打的鼻青脸肿那位

51
00:06:57,076 --> 00:07:00,016
洛奇这么叫的  他想念这张脸了
Rocky called. He wants his face back.

52
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:03,070
别这样  开心一点嘛
Come on. I got to cheer you up.

53
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:06,084
看到这照片没  这就是你的刑满释放证
You see that? That's your Get Out of Jail Free card.

54
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:09,007
你知道什么叫刑满释放证  对吧
You understand Get Out of Jail Free card, right?

55
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,054
这机会千载难逢
I mean, just blink once if you're following.

56
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,001
缉毒局的噩梦
The DEA's worst nightmare

57
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:16,081
如果这张照片公之于众的话
is that face out in public.

58
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:18,052
到时候他们将对我们平克曼少爷
They're going to have to steer a wide berth

59
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:19,070
唯恐避之不及了
of young Master Pinkman

60
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,090
因为到时愤怒的公众就如同
for fear of the P.R. Poop storm

61
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,025
潮水一般势不可挡
that will rain down on them

62
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,012
如果这消息走漏了的话
if this story ever gets out.

63
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:26,092
我是说  你挨的这顿揍
I mean, this-- this beating?

64
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:29,016
对你来说简直是恩赐
Best thing for you.

65
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,076
你已经稳操胜券了
You're home free.

66
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,026
好事  对吧
Good, right?

67
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,037
对的
Right.

68
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,059
我的天
Oh, my God.

69
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:00,016
现在二人组里你明显比较可爱一点
You're now officially the cute one of the group.

70
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:02,086
调侃披头士乐队里保罗是吉他手 林戈是鼓手

71
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,086
保罗  来见见林戈  林戈 这是保罗
Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.

72
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,067
这是...我...
This is-- I--

73
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,020
杰西  我...对此万分抱歉
Jesse, I'm-- I am so sorry for this.

74
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,014
本不该发展成这样的
This should not have happened.

75
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:19,024
但还是这样了
But it did.

76
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:21,061
拜你所赐
No thanks to you.

77
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:27,062
至少计划成功了
But the plan did work.

78
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:29,062
如果不把他引开  我们现在
We would have been locked up right now

79
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:31,012
已经被关起来了
if we didn't lure him away.

80
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:32,032
但这一切...
But this--

81
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:34,093
这一切...我...
this-- I just--

82
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,073
是我始料未及的
I never saw this coming.

83
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,050
所以...
So...

84
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:48,047
那现在该怎么办
What, uh... W-what happens now?

85
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,064
现在该怎么办
What happens now?

86
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:54,081
我来告诉你该怎么办
I'll tell you what happens now.

87
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:59,048
你那混蛋连襟玩完了
Your scumbag brother-in-law is finished,

88
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:01,069
死定了
done.

89
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,074
听懂了吗
You understand?

90
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:08,023
我跟他没完  我要他一辈子都欠我
I will own him when this is over.

91
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:10,086
他挣的每一分钱
Every cent he earns,

92
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,060
他老婆挣的每一分钱
every cent his wife earns,

93
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:17,037
都是我的
is mine.

94
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,067
无论他去哪里
Anyplace he goes,

95
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,064
无论他在哪里
anywhere he turns,

96
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:24,014
我都会跟他到死
I'm going to be there,

97
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:26,091
分一杯羹
grabbing my share.

98
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:31,078
哪怕他躲到提华纳洗厕所为生
He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana for pennies,

99
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:31,078
提华纳是墨西哥西北部城市

100
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:37,042
我也会站他旁边提成的
and I'll be standing over him to get my cut.

101
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,046
我要他早上一醒来第一个看到的就是我
He'll see me when he wakes up in the morning

102
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:41,096
我要他晚上爬着睡
and when he crawls to sleep

103
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:44,039
因为他那狗窝
in whatever rat hole's left for him

104
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:48,033
已经被我碾得粉碎
after I shred his house down,

105
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:55,008
我他妈要化成厉鬼缠他一辈子
I will haunt his crusty ass forever

106
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,047
直到他自己
until the day

107
00:09:57,051 --> 00:10:03,025
举枪饮弹自尽
he sticks a gun up his mouth and pulls the trigger

108
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:05,085
就为了能把我从他脑子里驱除出去
just to get me out of his head.

109
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:12,084
这就是接下来要发生的
That's what happens next.

110
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:23,030
我的建议...
Uh, my advice--

111
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:26,054
这办法听起来可不太好
that's probably not a good strategy.

112
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,097
他们现在怕你
I mean, they're scared of you right now.

113
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,061
他们根本不想与你扯上关系
They want nothing to do with you.

114
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,048
但如果你惹了他们
But if you hit them,

115
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:35,055
他们肯定被迫还击
they're forced to hit back hard.

116
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:37,081
他们会查个天翻地覆
I mean, they will turn over every rock

117
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,062
让你无处躲藏
hither, thither, and yon

118
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:41,089
直到有人说漏嘴  泄了密
until someone spills the beans on you

119
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:43,072
或是泄了与你有关的人的密
and anyone associated with you,

120
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,026
包括你现在的合伙人
uh, present company included.

121
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:48,049
对  我觉得索尔说的非常有道理
Yeah, I think what Saul is saying makes a lot of sense.

122
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:53,000
杰西  还是继续生活  往前看吧
Jesse, move on with your life.

123
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:55,007
别去想这一切了
Leave it behind, all of it.

124
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,030
一切照旧
Nothing changes.

125
00:10:57,034 --> 00:11:00,047
我一离开这
Once I walk out of here,

126
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:04,098
就去搞辆新房车  继续制毒
I get myself a new RV and go start cooking again.

127
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:09,075
你凭什么认为
How exactly do you think

128
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:11,062
你能侥幸逃脱的了
you're going to get away with that?

129
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:13,015
他们会逮到你的
They will catch you.

130
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:14,055
那又怎样
So what?

131
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:15,059
什么
What?

132
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,082
我有刑满释放证
I have a Get Out of Jail Free card.

133
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:22,080
我可能是夸大了你...这张脸的影响力
Hey, I may have overstated the, uh, power of your face.

134
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,043
不行
Not this.

135
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:29,067
如果警察逮到了我
If the cops catch me...

136
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,061
我会告诉他们最想知道的
I give them what they want the most.

137
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:39,011
你
You.

138
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:46,025
他们逮了我
They nab me,

139
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:53,056
我就和他们做个交易  供出谁是海森堡
I make a deal to give up the great Heisenberg

140
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,080
还有他那百万毒品交易网络
and his million-dollar drug ring.

141
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,027
你就是我的自由通行证  贱人
You're my free pass, bitch.

142
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,031
你就那么肯定吗
You're so sure.

143
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,032
听着  他被汉克打的都失去意识了
Look, if he didn't give up my name

144
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,038
都没把我供出来
while Hank was beating him senseless,

145
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:18,099
那他就肯定不会供出来
he's never going to talk.

146
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:21,066
那你觉得刚才那是什么意思  吓唬你吗
What do you think that was in there, a bluff?

147
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:23,049
他想要搞死你的连襟
He wants your brother-in-law.

148
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:25,029
而且绝对有一大票的律师
And there's going to be a parade of lawyers

149
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:27,073
排成行的等着接这案子
creaming their Underoos for a case like that.

150
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:29,010
我是说  如果不是我有涉及
I mean, I'd take it myself

151
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,047
此事的话  我肯定也去接这活儿了
if it wouldn't cause so much collateral damage.

152
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,010
至于他说要再去制毒
And him cooking again.

153
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:35,094
不用考虑如果  他肯定被捕  当他被捕时
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,

154
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:37,037
他面临20年监禁
and he's facing 20 years,

155
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,077
你觉得他会怎么做
what'll he do then?

156
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:42,001
相信我  贼之间毫无信义可言
Believe me, there's no honor among thieves.

157
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:45,028
当然  我们除外
Except for us, of course.

158
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:47,092
不  他会...
No, he'll--

159
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:49,015
他会清醒过来的
he'll come around.

160
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,085
万一醒不了呢
And if he doesn't,

161
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,029
那就得谈谈可能采取的措施了
there may come a time to talk options.

162
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:57,002
措施
Options?

163
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:13,047
我非常确信平克曼先生涉嫌
I'm convinced that Mr. Pinkman was involved

164
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:15,028
制造和分发销售
in the manufacture and distribution

165
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:16,068
苯基-2-甲基苯丙胺
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine,

166
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:18,099
我们称之为蓝色冰毒
specifically what we're calling the blue meth.

167
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:21,092
我跟踪他到废料场
I tracked him to a scrap yard

168
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:27,059
他在那藏匿了一辆80年代的野营房车
where he stored an early '80s camper,an RV.

169
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:29,063
我坚信那是一处移动实验室  专门制毒的
While waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle,

170
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:32,070
在等待车辆搜查令的时候
which I believed to be a rolling meth lab,

171
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:35,037
我接到一个电话
I received a telephone call

172
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,088
说我老婆玛丽出了车祸受了伤
telling me my wife Marie had been injured in an accident.

173
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:41,010
听到这个消息
Upon hearing the news,

174
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:44,007
我离开了平克曼先生和他的房车
I left Mr. Pinkman and his vehicle

175
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:46,068
去我老婆那了
to tend to my wife.

176
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:48,062
到医院以后
After arriving at the hospital,

177
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,078
我才发觉那个急救电话是个骗局
I learned the emergency call was a hoax.

178
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:54,035
幸运的是  我的老婆没有受伤
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

179
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:59,053
所以我立刻回到了废料场
So I immediately went back to the salvage yard,

180
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:01,023
但是房车已经消失了
but the RV was gone.

181
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,094
很有可能是被就地销毁了
Most likely destroyed on site.

182
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:05,020
而就在这时
And it was at this point

183
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:07,023
你开车去了杰西·平克曼的家
that you drove to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

184
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,098
我们今天先谈到这里吧
I think we're done here.

185
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:24,092
施拉德探员需要回家休息
Agent Schrader needs to get home, get some rest.

186
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,005
没问题
That's fine.

187
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:27,099
只是确定一下
But just to confirm,

188
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,069
你是在行使你的避而不答权利吗
you're taking the Fifth here?

189
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,069
以美国宪法第五条修正案为庇护  采取避而不答

190
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:31,056
是的  没错
Yeah. That's correct.

191
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:36,046
好的  只是想给你们提个醒
Okay. Well, we just want to give you all a heads up.

192
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,013
平克曼先生正在起诉此事
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges in this matter.

193
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:41,067
他已给出
He's given a detailed version

194
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:44,054
整件事的详细经过
of events as he sees them.

195
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,001
毒枭之言可信吗
The word of a meth head.

196
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:47,084
我们了解他的过去
We know all about his history.

197
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,091
我们都非常清楚
We're well aware,

198
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:52,038
但是他的毒性测试
but toxicology on Pinkman--

199
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,098
结果正常  他没有吸毒
his blood is clean, he's not using.

200
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:58,042
据我们所知  他甚至拒绝服用医嘱
The kid is even refusing his doctor-ordered pain meds,

201
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,025
用的止痛药
as far as we can tell.

202
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,039
那么...
So, um...

203
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,093
...接下来要怎么办
...where do we go from here?

204
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,090
会来几个司法部的人
A couple of gentlemen from OPR will come down,

205
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:13,013
可能是明天上午
probably tomorrow morning.

206
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,044
詹妮斯会另外安排的
Janice will give us an exact time on that.

207
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,097
你的人还将继续你的调查
And you men will be continuing your investigation,

208
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,004
那么...
so...

209
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,048
谢谢配合
Thanks for your time.

210
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,058
好的  我们...
Right. We just--

211
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:26,021
还有一件事
We need one more thing.

212
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:31,008
施拉德探员手部的照片  需要记录在案
Photo of Agent Schrader's hands, for the record.

213
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:34,022
当然
Yes, of course.

214
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:36,069
如你愿意  请撕掉绷带
Bandage off, if you would.

215
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,090
把手放在桌上就好
Um, on the table is fine.

216
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,033
平放在桌上
Flat on the table is fine.

217
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:30,050
一切都会好起来的
It's all going to work out.

218
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:33,051
这么多年  你对他们太好了
You've been too good to them for too many years.

219
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,087
我想我们应该心照不宣
I hope it goes without saying

220
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:38,021
对外人绝口不提此事
that we're not talking to anybody about this, okay?

221
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,075
好的
Okay.

222
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:46,025
玛丽  你告诉谁了
Marie, who?

223
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,044
有时间吗
Do you have a minute?

224
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:28,011
当然
Sure.

225
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:44,099
犯罪的确很赚
I guess crime does pay.

226
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:52,080
你不是特地来羞辱我的吧
I don't suppose you just came by to insult me.

227
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,064
当然不是  我们得谈谈
No. We need to talk.

228
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:01,004
汉克的事你听说了吗
You heard about Hank?

229
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:05,004
和这个杰西·平克曼有关的
About what happened with this, um, Jesse Pinkman?

230
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:07,021
我知道
Yes, I know.

231
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:09,072
不管汉克在调查什么
Whatever Hank was investigating,

232
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:13,092
他在找一辆房车
him trying to find an RV,

233
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:15,096
有没有可能
is there any danger

234
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,042
最终结果指向你
that could lead back to you?

235
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:22,070
怎么可能
No. Why would it?

236
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:28,037
这就是你来的原因吗
Is this why you're here?

237
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:31,087
我是来和你谈谈汉克的
I'm here to talk about Hank.

238
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:36,048
如果平克曼控告他
You know what's going to happen to him

239
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,004
你知道他会怎样吗
if this Pinkman presses charges?

240
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:43,045
汉克会一无所有
Hank could lose everything.

241
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:50,049
我想或许...
I thought maybe, um...

242
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:53,043
或许你能帮他
There's a way you could help him.

243
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,026
怎么帮
How?

244
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,036
联系平克曼
Contact Pinkman.

245
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,030
劝他撤消控诉
Get him to drop the charges.

246
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,014
听着  斯凯勒  我不知道
Look, Skyler, I don't know what kind of relationship

247
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:05,047
你是如何想像我和这个人的关系
you picture me having with this person.

248
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:06,051
我不是在要求你
I'm not asking.

249
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:08,021
他曾经...现在...
He was-- He's--

250
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,074
他不是我的朋友
He's not my friend.

251
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:11,008
我们根本不...
I mean, it's not as if we--

252
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,034
-我...  -我们以前关系也不好
- I'm--  - ...were even close.

253
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:14,061
我没有强求
I'm not asking.

254
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:17,018
但你一定能和他说些什么
But there must be something you could say.

255
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:21,022
连试都不试一下吗
Isn't it even worth a try?

256
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:23,036
汉克是你的家人
Hank is your family.

257
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:28,059
目前不是了
Not currently.

258
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:29,083
你说什么
What?

259
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:32,047
我说目前不是了
I said not currently.

260
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,087
我上班迟到了  得走了
I'm late. I have to go.

261
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:11,097
你来了  我都开始担心了
Hello. I was starting to get worried.

262
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,001
车子有点问题
Car trouble.

263
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:20,028
那岂不是很郁闷
Oh. That's a bummer.

264
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,098
下次你应该给我电话
You should call me next time.

265
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,035
我去接你
I'll pick you up.

266
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,052
不用  今天怎么不穿凉鞋了
No, uh, no sandals today?

267
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:33,043
我想...
I just thought--

268
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,050
显得更专业点
a bit more professional.

269
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:40,067
一切都走上正轨了
Well, everything is on track.

270
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:45,034
蒸馏物好了  只需等到...
We got our distillate. Just waiting to--

271
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,037
把托盘准备好
Let's get our trays ready.

272
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,024
要干净的  不能沾水
Clean, no moisture.

273
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,008
准备好了
Done.

274
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:56,052
那么...
Is our, uh...

275
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,082
溶剂过滤好了吗
Our solvent filtered?

276
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:59,099
我就猜到你会问
I thought you might ask that.

277
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:01,029
过滤好了
Done.

278
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,046
很好
That's good.

279
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:06,093
很好
That's good.

280
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:09,086
齐心协力  亲密无间  要的就是这效果
Hand in glove. That's what we strive for.

281
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,057
你知道吗
You know,

282
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,064
这或许是一段伟大友谊的开端
this might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

283
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:50,064
就是你们吗
So, you the gentlemen?

284
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:56,034
算你们找对人了  我有很多宝贝
Lucky you boys called me. I got a load to pick up.

285
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:58,021
我正在运点40口径的去孟菲斯城
I'm taking the 40 straight through to Memphis.

286
00:22:58,024 --> 00:22:59,075
我可以出让15把左右
I could hammer it out in about 15,

287
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,008
但那里有位姑娘
but there's a girl down there

288
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:03,018
叫莱妮或者罗莉  可能是弗兰
named Lainie or Lolly or something. Maybe Fran.

289
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:04,022
她有特殊的癖好
She's got one of these fetish things--

290
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:05,015
喜欢被人撒尿
wants to get peed on.

291
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:06,013
希望今晚能见到她
You know I was hoping to see her tonight,

292
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:07,009
但她真的挺按部就班的
but she is really straight about.

293
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,073
要10点前睡觉
Wanted to get sleep before 10:00,

294
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,034
所以这次交易越快越好
so I want to wrap it up here ASAP

295
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:11,096
因为路况总是未知数
because traffic can be a wild card,

296
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:13,029
好奇的观光客之类
you know, rubbernecking and such.

297
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,091
意外的是  这种喜欢被人撒尿的女人
The surprising thing is women who like to get peed on

298
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:18,056
总是来自气候温暖的地方
always tend to be from the warmer climates.

299
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:19,070
总以为寒冷地区的女人
You'd think the ones in the colder zones

300
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,079
更可能有这种倾向
would be more inclined.

301
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:22,084
如果人体不能适应新环境
Maybe it's a shock to the system

302
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:24,040
也许会休克
if the body's not properly acclimated,

303
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,071
还是把这个问题留给聪明人去想吧
but, you know, I leave that for smart minds than me.

304
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:31,001
科学本身就是一个谜
Science is a mystery.

305
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:32,071
来瞅瞅
Well, take a gander.

306
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:34,035
价钱好商量
Prices are negotiable.

307
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,053
大批量购买有折扣
Buying in bulk gets you a discount.

308
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:37,058
这些小宝贝有特别优惠
I'm running a special on these little honeys.

309
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:41,045
空尖型子弹
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,

310
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,012
当地人都把这些宝贝称作黑死病
known by the natives as Black Death.

311
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:44,076
看看吧  中意吗
Check it out. Huh. You like that?

312
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,036
太棒了  你会爱死它的
So sweet, you want to lick it.

313
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,056
镀镍铜锌合金外壳  黑拉巴洛克斯弹头
Nickel-plated brass casing, Lubalox coat for panache.

314
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,020
弹头六片利爪受到挤压会立马展开
Sucker has six razor claws that expand upon impact.

315
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:53,080
可以把你妈的脑袋撕个大洞
Shred your mama's head like a cabbage.

316
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,077
拿着吧  免费
Keep it. On the house?

317
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,027
我废话说太多了
Anyhow, I've been windjamming long enough.

318
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,078
何不告诉我你们要买什么
Why don't you boys tell me what you're looking for?

319
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,082
你们想要什么  需要什么
What is you want? What is you need?

320
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,090
有什么可以效劳的
What can I do you for?

321
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,025
防弹衣
Vests.

322
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,098
防弹衣  当然  有的是
Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.

323
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:08,005
就在这里
Right here.

324
00:24:12,022 --> 00:24:13,069
光滑舒适
Sleek, comfortable,

325
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,082
热粘合非交织凯夫拉尔纤维
thermally bonded non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.

326
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,088
阻挡子弹就像对着修女手淫一样舒服
Stop a bullet like a soft wank against a Quaker girl.

327
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,022
子弹就是穿不透
Just ain't getting through.

328
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,059
轻吗
And lightweight?

329
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:21,079
太他妈轻了
Damn, so lightweight,

330
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:23,012
你根本感觉不到穿了它
you'll forget you're wearing it.

331
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:26,012
有用吗
They work?

332
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:28,076
屁话  当然有用
Sure as shit, they do.

333
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,070
没有它我绝不出门
I don't leave home without it.

334
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:40,044
你他妈
What the hell?

335
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:45,091
你他妈把我肋骨弄断了  你个混蛋
You broke my freakin' rib, you maniac son of a bitch.

336
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:18,064
不客气
You're welcome!

337
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,079
你设的几度
What temperature did you set here?

338
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,073
那里吗  是...
There? That's...

339
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:45,060
5号机  75摄氏度
Station Five-- 75 C.

340
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:50,017
我说过85度
I said 85.

341
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,067
8-5
8-5.

342
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:56,058
我...我写下来的
I, uh-- I wrote it down.

343
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:58,034
你说是75度
You said 75.

344
00:25:58,038 --> 00:25:59,061
我写了
I-- I wrote it.

345
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:00,075
那就是你记错了
Well, then you wrote it wrong.

346
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:03,098
那不是我说的  我说85度
That's not what I said. I said 85.

347
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:07,042
一直是85度
It's always been 85--

348
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:10,086
不是75  也不是95
not 75, not 95.

349
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:12,033
85  度
85.

350
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:15,073
这是化学  温度是关键
This is chemistry. Degrees matter.

351
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:21,010
对不起
I'm sorry.

352
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,010
我很抱歉
I'm very sorry.

353
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,057
很好  你感到抱歉
Great. You're sorry.

354
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:29,008
同时你酿造了50加仑的无用烂泥
Meanwhile, you've just brewed 50 gallons of useless sludge.

355
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:30,034
祝贺你
Congratulations.

356
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:32,091
倒掉  统统倒掉
Just dump it. Dump it all.

357
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:34,055
这一批都毁了
This batch is ruined.

358
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,068
你看上去挺帅
You look nice.

359
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:13,095
我像电视上那种天气预报员
I look like a TV weatherman.

360
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:17,052
来杯咖啡吗
You want a coffee?

361
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:25,087
我榨了些橙汁
I squeezed some orange juice.

362
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,080
要来一杯吗
You want to glass of orange juice?

363
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:30,017
不用了
I'm all right.

364
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,058
你打算怎么对他们说
What are you going to tell them?

365
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,039
你要这样告诉他们
Here's what you're going to tell them.

366
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:49,082
是他先攻击你的
He attacked you.

367
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,019
他先打我
He attacked me?

368
00:27:51,023 --> 00:27:53,073
他操家伙打你
He-- he swung at you with something.

369
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:55,050
他...
He-- he--

370
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:57,056
-打我  -他用管子打你
- swung at me. - ... attacked you with a pipe.

371
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,087
管子
With a pipe?

372
00:28:00,073 --> 00:28:01,094
一切发生的太快
It happened fast.

373
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,030
他拒捕
He resisted arrest,

374
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:05,047
你肌肉记忆本能反应
and muscle memory kicked in,

375
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,074
所以你被迫解除他的武装
and you had to disarm him.

376
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:09,054
肌肉记忆
Muscle memory.

377
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:11,077
是的  这种事经常发生
Yes. It happens all the time.

378
00:28:11,077 --> 00:28:12,067
经过多年的训练
Years of training,

379
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,025
你的身体不假思索地做出反应
and your body acted faster than your brain.

380
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,025
你除了打他没别的选择
You had no choice but to hit him.

381
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,085
-你只有反击  -玛丽  玛丽  玛丽
- You had to fight back. - Marie, Marie, Marie.

382
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,032
不
No.

383
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:25,093
我不打算去撒谎
I'm not going to go in there and lie.

384
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:28,076
这是你和社会渣滓
It's some lowlife degenerate

385
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,060
之间的较量
versus you...

386
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:33,073
你只是在履行自己的职责
Doing the job you're supposed to.

387
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,067
为什么你行得端做得正
Why should you be the one who pays

388
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:39,094
反而要付出代价
for doing the right thing?

389
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:42,044
亲爱的  我做的不对
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

390
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:45,078
我的职责不是这个
It's not what the job is.

391
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,028
我应该比这做得更好
I'm supposed to be better than that.

392
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:53,045
现在你只犯了一个错
And you made one mistake.

393
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:57,096
不  不只是一个错  我一直
No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been--

394
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:02,026
我一直以来都
I've been...

395
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:07,090
处在崩溃的边缘  你明白吗
...unraveling, you know?

396
00:29:12,014 --> 00:29:14,021
我晚上再也不能安睡
I don't sleep at night anymore.

397
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,008
我战栗
I freeze.

398
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:19,081
全身僵硬
I freeze up.

399
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:24,085
我的胸口发闷  无法呼吸
My chest gets all tight. I-- I can't breathe.

400
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:28,019
就是...
Just--

401
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:30,046
我恐惧不已
I panic.

402
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:37,003
自从塞拉曼加那件事开始就这样
Ever since that Salamanca thing.

403
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:39,027
屠库·塞拉曼加
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

404
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,070
那个罪该万死的人渣
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet between the eyes.

405
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:49,078
那件事改变了我
It changed me.

406
00:29:54,055 --> 00:29:57,005
我好像控制不住自己了
And I can't seem to control it.

407
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:02,066
我努力反抗
I tried to fight it.

408
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:08,083
但后来又有埃尔帕索的事
But then El Paso.

409
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,050
可情况只是越来越糟糕
And it's just gotten worse.

410
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,024
我对平克曼做出的事
What I did to Pinkman...

411
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:23,011
我不应该是那个样子
...that's not who I'm supposed to be.

412
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:24,041
那不是我
That's not me.

413
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:29,038
所有这些
All this--

414
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:33,029
所发生的这一切  我...
everything that's happened, I--

415
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:36,036
我可以向上帝发誓  玛丽
I swear to God, Marie,

416
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,019
我觉得像是冥冥之中  要告诉我什么
I think the universe is trying to tell me something,

417
00:30:41,023 --> 00:30:44,050
现在我终于
and I'm finally...

418
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:46,023
准备好要听了
Ready to listen.

419
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:57,044
我再也不是曾经的我了
I'm just not the man I thought I was.

420
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:03,015
我想我的警察生涯到头了
I think I'm done as a cop.

421
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:16,076
作出这个决定并不容易
Now, this is-- is not an easy decision,

422
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,007
但是这是我必须作出的决定
but it is one that I have to make.

423
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,077
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,007
现在这个
This whole...

425
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,081
对于盖尔的情况
Gale situation--

426
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:29,011
他就是不行
he's-- he's just not working out.

427
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:34,051
是的  现在
Yes. Now.

428
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:37,078
听起来也许有点奇怪
It-- It may sound unorthodox,

429
00:31:37,082 --> 00:31:39,028
但我认为
but I think

430
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:43,026
我们的首选  最好的人选
our first-- best option...

431
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:47,056
是杰西·平克曼
Is Jesse Pinkman.

432
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,070
喂
Hello?

433
00:31:57,091 --> 00:31:59,001
这
It--

434
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:01,027
不  听我说
No, look. Th-There's--

435
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:05,018
我们之间有种默契
There's a-- a shorthand that exists between us--

436
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,095
有共同的经历
experience together

437
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:09,068
说实话  这种默契的程度
at a level that, quite frankly,

438
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:12,035
我和盖尔之间永远不可能达到
I-- I'm just never going to reach with Gale.

439
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:20,036
听着  福林先生
Look, Mr. Fring,

440
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,066
我接受你的邀请时
when I accepted your offer,

441
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,003
说好实验室归我管
I was told the lab is mine.

442
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:28,037
我也最清楚该怎么管理它
And I know best how to run it.

443
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:35,017
谢谢
Thank you.

444
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,021
谢谢  是的  我会的  我会的
Thank you. Yes, I will. I will.

445
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,058
好的  再见
Okay. Good-bye.

446
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:52,002
听着  有事情告诉你
Listen, something's come up.

447
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:56,010
我想是一次好机会
And, uh, I think it's a good opportunity.

448
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,087
有个职位空缺
There's been a job opening.

449
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,064
我需要个新的实验助手
I need a new lab assistant.

450
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:09,048
我已经为你干过了
I already did my time.

451
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:11,091
你干吗不去给你自己找只猴子
Why don't you just go get yourself a monkey?

452
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:17,025
我不要猴子  我要你
I don't want a monkey. I want you.

453
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,069
噢  老天  谢谢
Oh, gee, thanks.

454
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:22,032
没兴趣
Well, not interested.

455
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:26,016
我自己有事情做
I got my own thing going on.

456
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:30,056
想救你的蠢货连襟没门儿
Nice try saving your ass head brother-in-law.

457
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,027
我不是为这个而来  杰西
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

458
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,091
还有别的事
There's more.

459
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:43,081
你将不仅仅是我的助手
It's more than an assistant.

460
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,061
也是合作伙伴
Partners.

461
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,092
我们又要成为搭档了
We'll be partners again.

462
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:52,055
一切照旧  五五分成
Split everything 50-50, just like before.

463
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,082
一人得一百五十万
$1.5 million each.

464
00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:06,090
不
No.

465
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,074
我想你没听明白
I don't think you heard--

466
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:18,091
我听得很清楚
I've heard you fine.

467
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:20,088
我说不
I said no.

468
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:26,089
让我理一下思路
Let me understand this.

469
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:31,022
你这是在拒绝一百五十万
You're turning down $1 1/2 million.

470
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:34,086
我不是在拒绝钱
I am not turning down the money.

471
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:38,013
我在拒绝你
I am turning down you.

472
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:40,037
你明白吗
You get it?

473
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,004
我不想和你有任何瓜葛
I want nothing to do with you.

474
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:48,034
自从我遇见你
Ever since I met you,

475
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:52,081
我所关心的一切
everything I have ever cared about

476
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:55,048
全都没了
is gone...

477
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:59,043
毁了  废了  死了
Ruined, turned to shit, dead,

478
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:05,042
自从我和你--伟大的海森堡搅合在一起之后
ever since I hooked up with the great Heisenberg.

479
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:09,030
我感到空前的孤独
I have never been more alone.

480
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:12,026
我变得一无所有
I have nothing!

481
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,077
没人理我
No one!

482
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,060
懂了吗  什么都没了
All right? It's all gone!

483
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:19,094
懂吗
Get it?

484
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:22,091
不  不  不
No. No, no.

485
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:25,021
你怎么会
Why--

486
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:29,018
你怎么会懂
Why would you get it?

487
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:30,065
你只要得到你想要的
What do you even care

488
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:35,052
你还关心什么
as long as you get what you want?

489
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:37,006
我说对了吧
Right?

490
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:41,039
你他妈根本就没在乎过我
You don't give a shit about me.

491
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,003
你说我没用
You said I was no good.

492
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:49,074
一无是处
I'm nothing!

493
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:53,014
现在怎么又要我了
Why would you want me? Huh?

494
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:59,026
你说过我的毒是下等货
You said my meth is inferior, right?

495
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,037
不是吗
Right?

496
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:04,062
嘿  是你说我制的毒是垃圾
Hey! You said my cook was garbage!

497
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:08,086
去你妈的  老头  去你的
Hey, screw you, man! Screw you!

498
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,073
你制的冰毒很好  杰西
Your meth is good, Jesse.

499
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:19,077
不比我的差
As good as mine.

500
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,073
是我
Yeah.

501
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,040
五五分
50-50.

502
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:26,073
是的  五五分
Yes. 50-50.

503
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,080
好吧
Okay.

504
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,097
合作伙伴
Partners.

505
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,045
太好了
Good.

506
00:37:54,058 --> 00:37:57,034
通用痛苦程度评估表

507
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:33,005
这就是你想做的书面声明吗
This is the statement you want to give?

508
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:35,095
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

509
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:38,019
汉克  你不必这么做
Hank, you don't have to do this.

510
00:38:38,022 --> 00:38:39,049
不  我...
No, I--

511
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:42,036
我要这样
I do.

512
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,059
我没事
I'm good.

513
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:49,096
那我们姑且认为
So we understand

514
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,020
如果我们这样写  你会签字
if we write it up like that, you'll sign it.

515
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:56,084
事情就是那样的
That's the way it happened.

516
00:38:58,011 --> 00:39:00,011
我愿意承担后果
I accept the consequences.

517
00:39:05,098 --> 00:39:09,015
介于上述事实
In the light of these facts...

518
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:12,025
从即刻起  你被停薪停职
As of this moment, you're suspended without pay.

519
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:16,006
请交出警徽和佩枪
I have to ask you to hand over your badge and your gun.

520
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:17,023
是  长官
Yes, sir.

521
00:39:47,076 --> 00:39:48,096
施拉德
Schrader.

522
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:51,036
等一会
Hold up.

523
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,049
什么事  长官
Yes, sir?

524
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,056
我想告诉你件事
I just want to tell you something.

525
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,083
但说清楚  你不是从我这儿听来的
And to be clear, you didn't hear it from me.

526
00:39:57,087 --> 00:39:59,090
我不想你空欢喜一场
I don't want you to get your hopes up,

527
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:01,017
不过上面传下话来
but the word in the pipeline is

528
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,010
平克曼撤诉了
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

529
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:05,081
为什么
Why not?

530
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:08,061
谁知道呢
Who the hell knows?

531
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:11,018
也许你有个守护天使呢
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

532
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,097
事情有了好转
It went fine.

533
00:40:36,037 --> 00:40:38,014
好转的意思...
Well, fine means what--

534
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:39,071
就是好转的意思  对
means what it means. Yeah.

535
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:42,028
我会
I'll, uh...

536
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:45,025
等我到家了我会全部告诉你  好吗
I'll tell you all about it when I get home, okay?

537
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,052
是的
Yeah. It's--

538
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:50,075
是的  就是
Yeah, it's just--

539
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,009
我也不知道  亲爱的  我就是觉得
I don't know, baby. I just think--

540
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:54,082
我想我们可能没事了
I think we may be okay.

541
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:56,012
是的
Yeah.

542
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:58,069
好  我也爱你
Okay. I love you, too.

543
00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:20,088
施拉德
Schrader.

544
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:23,045
你仔细听好
I need you to listen very carefully.

545
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:25,032
有两个人要来杀你
Two men are coming to kill you.

546
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:26,082
再说一遍
Come again?

547
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:29,019
他们正向你的车子走去
They're approaching your car.

548
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:31,016
你有一分钟时间逃走
You have one minute.

549
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:33,036
不知道你玩什么把戏  滚一边去吧
I don't get the gag, jerk off.

550
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:36,016
他们就要来了
They're coming.

551
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,043
喂
Hello.

552
00:41:52,082 --> 00:41:53,098
嘿  听...
Hey, Li--

553
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:57,024
嘿  格米  我是汉克
Hey, Gomie, this is Hank.

554
00:41:57,024 --> 00:41:58,039
不知道你这通电话什么意思
I don't know what that call's supposed to be,

555
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:59,072
即使按你的水准也太白痴了
but it's dumb even by your standards,

556
00:41:59,072 --> 00:42:02,058
听到留言给我回电话
so call me when you get this.

557
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,013
干掉他

558
00:45:14,056 --> 00:45:15,066
不
No.

559
00:45:17,098 --> 00:45:19,085
这样便宜你了
