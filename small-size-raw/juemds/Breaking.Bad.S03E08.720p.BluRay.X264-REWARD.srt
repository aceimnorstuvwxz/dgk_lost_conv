不是  不是你想得这么好

47
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,053
是因为那天的温度设定的问题吗
Is this about the temperature setting the other day?

我向你保证绝对不会再发生此类情况...
Because I can assure you that will not happen--

49
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,087
不仅仅是因为那个原因  盖尔

50
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,080
原因...要比那个严重得多

00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,077
能说详细点吗
Could you elaborate?

00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:24,040
当然  当然可以详细点
Well, uh, yes, of course I could,

53
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,046
但我认为这种
but I don't think either of us

54
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:31,038
长期的合作关系  对我们彼此都不太有益...
would necessarily benefit from a prolonged...

55
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:35,049
恩  就是这样
uh, yeah, so...

56
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:36,052

前途一片光明

63
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,050
只是...我...
It's just that-- that I--

64
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:59,021
我们有点...
that-- that we just have different...

65
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,011
不合拍  盖尔
rhythms, Gale.

66
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:03,021
就好比是...
It's-- It's--

67
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:07,095
就好比  我是古典音乐
It's as if I'm classical

68
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,092
而你却更像是
but you are-- are more...

69
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:13,085
爵士乐
jazz.

70
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,049
-爵士乐  -爵士乐
- Jazz. - Jazz.

71
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:17,066
对
Yes.

72
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,056
当然  爵士乐绝没有任何不对的地方
And God knows there is nothing wrong with jazz.

73
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,059
只不过  我需要的是...
It's simply that I require--

74
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,043
古典音乐
Classical.

75
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:29,034

哥们  这地方太牛了
Man, this is the bomb.

78
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:45,085
你好啊  合伙人
What's up, partner?

79
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,046
-难以置信  -这就是来代替我的吗
- I can't believe this. - This is my replacement?

80
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,083
我的天
Oh, Jesus.

81
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:57,020
你好  我是盖尔  见到你很高兴
Hi. Gale. Nice to meet you.

82

你好
What's up?

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,043
靠  我们早就该在几月前把那房车扔了
Damn, we should have ditched that RV months ago.

84
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:04,010
这里简直让人眼前一亮
It's all, like, shining up in here.

85
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,038
不好意思  是不是还有什么没告诉我的
I'm sorry. I must be missing something.

86
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,021
我不是...不是故意要...
I don't mean-- I don't mean to be--

87
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:15,042
-这  -我的天
- This-- - No!

88
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:18,035
这完全没道理
...makes no sense.

89
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,093
那么...
So...

90
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:30,053
我想我们应该...
I guess this is--

91
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,024
我的老天爷
Oh, dear mother of God.

92
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:41,061
这完全是为了大局着想

一周交200磅的货

00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:50,058

So you haven't talked to anybody today

110
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:38,033
当然  那位科学呆子老兄除外
other than, you know, Captain Nerd there.

111
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,048
怎么了
Why?

112
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,047
你那连襟
Your brother-in-law.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,037
他怎么了

- So what's the story? - Upon arrival, he was unresponsive.

115
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,049
你来看一下  把伤口再暴露一点

情况很糟

他呼吸声很急促
He's got breath sounds bilaterally.

120

这根大腿骨似乎全碎了

121
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,040
另外一根也没好到哪去

122
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:01,057
鞋子给他脱掉

125
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,014
血浆来没有
Where's that blood?

126
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:13,038

135
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,094
不知道  他们不愿意透露
I don't know. They won't really tell us anything.

136
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:43,077
他还在手术中
He's still in surgery.

137
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:47,008
他身中四枪
They shot him four times.

138
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,011
上帝啊
Oh, Chirst.

00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:56,062

145
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:15,087

146
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,021
让我来开门吧
Here. Let me get the door.

147
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,098
我自己来  我没事
I got it. I'm fine.

148
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:24,092
沃尔特  对吧
Walt. Hmm?

149
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:27,029
沃尔特  这位是特别探员马科特
Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.

150
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:28,079
沃尔特是汉克的连襟
Hank's brother-in-law Walt.

151
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:30,015
你好
Hello.

152
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,019
我深表遗憾
I'm very sorry.

153
00:09:31,022 --> 00:09:32,026
谢谢你
Thank you. Uh--

154
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,025
能告诉我们事发经过吗
Can you tell us anything or any details?

155
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,081
只知道汉克中了那两人的埋伏
Right now, all we know is two men ambushed Hank.

156
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,068
没有他们的身份记录
They didn't have any I.D. On them.

157
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:42,046
可能是墨西哥侨民
Probably Mexican nationals.

158
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:47,006
纹身显示其与贩毒集团有瓜葛
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation with the drug cartel.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,040
他们为什么要袭击汉克
Why did they attack Hank?

160
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,007
目前还不清楚
We're not sure yet.

161
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,050
可能与汉克正在调查的案子有关
It could be in relation to an investigation that Hank was working,

162
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:01,037
也可能是向缉毒局示威
or it could be a message to the DEA in general.

163
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:05,074
他们手持斧头
They had an ax.

164
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,055
这个犯罪集团想要引人注目
The cartels tend to be dramatic.

165
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:12,022
我的天
Oh, Jesus.

166
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,042
他们在哪里  我是说...
Where are they? I mean, did they--

167
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:18,012
汉克把他们都放倒了
Hank got both of them.

168
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,039
击毙了一个
He killed one outright,

169
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,068
另一个在楼上  在抢救
and the other one's upstairs in critical condition.

170
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:23,091
你连襟这小子是硬汉
Your brother-in-law's one tough son of a b----

171
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:25,027
能干掉两个
to take them both out,

172
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:27,054
而且没有配枪
considering he didn't even have his gun.

173
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:32,048
他没有配枪吗
He didn't have his gun?

174
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,079
为什么汉克没有配枪
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

175
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,006
玛丽  打人案件
Marie, the assault charge.

176
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,026
调查期间不得已暂停汉克的职务
I had to suspend Hank pending the investigation.

177
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,063
也就是说我没收了他的配枪
That means I had to take away his weapon.

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,074
这是标准程序  没有人...
It's standard procedure. No one--

179
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,010
好了  给我听好了
Okay, All right. Listen.

180
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,059
如果你们一开始
If you would have all listened to him

181
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:57,082
就听他的
right from the start,

182
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:59,043
让他去抓那个小混混
and let him arrest that little degenerate,

183
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:01,095
他也不至于如此被动
he wouldn't have had to take things into his own hands,

184
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:04,019
有配枪他就能保护自己
and he would have had a gun and defended himself.

185
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,036
玛丽  让我们...
Marie, let's just--

186
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,039
别  让我...
No. Just--

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,080
这都是他们的错
It's their fault.

188
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,033
他没有配枪
He didn't have a gun.

189
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:15,044
亲爱的  这无济于事
Honey, this isn't helping you.

190
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,031
你
You.

191
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,091
你算是什么搭档
What kind of partner are you?

192
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,071
你应该支援他的
You were supposed to back him up,

193
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:25,018
可你在哪里
and where were you?

194
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:27,022
那时候你在哪里
Where were you?

195
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,092
德州
Texas.

196
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:32,087
还有你
And you.

197
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,021
你应该保护你的探员
You're supposed to protect your agents

198
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:38,058
而你却没收他们的配枪
instead of taking their guns,

199
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,001
不支持他们
not supporting them,

200
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:41,042
不支援他们...
not backing them up--

201
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,008
-玛丽  -当他们...
- Marie. Marie. - ...when they--

202
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:47,001
亲爱的  过去坐下好吗
Honey, let's just go and sit down, okay?

203
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:51,076
在他们给我滚出去之前  我哪里也不去
I'm not doing anything until these two get the hell out of here.

204
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,089
我是认真的
I mean it.

205
00:11:58,077 --> 00:12:00,027
-非常抱歉  -走
- Sorry-- - Go.

206
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,039
这里不欢迎你们
You are not welcome here.

207
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,044
这里不欢迎缉毒局的人
The DEA is not welcome here.

208
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:06,081
亲爱的
Honey.

209
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:08,021
来吧
Come on.

210
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:10,015
过来坐下
Come on. Let's go sit down.

211
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,083
不只是他们
It's not just them.

212
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,090
还有你  沃尔特
It's you, Walt.

213
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:39,039
汉克在找的这个平克曼
This Pinkman that Hank was looking for--

214
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,048
如果不是你从他那买大麻
Hank would have never even heard his name

215
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:47,032
他根本不会知道有这个人
if you hadn't bought marijuana from him.

216
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,038
玛丽
Marie--

217
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,049
你有想过吗  沃尔特
Do you ever think about that, Walt?

218
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,039
想过吗
Do you?

219
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:56,019
你有想过他这一切都是拜你所赐吗
Do you ever think about everything that you have put him through?

220
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:57,046
玛丽  别说了
Marie, stop.

221
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,005
你心烦
You're upset,

222
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:01,011
想找人发泄
and you're looking for someone to blame,

223
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,071
我可以理解  但不能怪沃尔特
and it's understandable, but don't blame Walt.

224
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,081
不是他的错
It's not his fault.

225
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:14,052
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:16,006
真的很抱歉
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,076
亲爱的  别  不要...
Sweetheart. No. No. No. Don't--

228
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,083
没事的
It's okay.

229
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:25,097
汉克他...
It's Hank--

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,020
没事的
It's all right.

231
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:46,035
好了  可以了
All right, you're done.

232
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,069
下一位
Okay, next.

233
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:26,019
有人吗
Hello!

234
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:32,003
有人吗  吗  吗  吗...
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

235
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:52,028
杰西·平克曼登场了
Jesse Pinkman in the house!

236
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:59,072
我的天
Oh, my dear God.

237
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:38,049
沃尔特·怀特  有你的电话
Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.

238
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:41,083
沃尔特·怀特  有你的电话
Walter White, please pick up a courtesy phone.

239
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:57,058
我们几时开工
Yo. We working sometime this year?

240
00:16:57,062 --> 00:16:58,079
你到底在想什么
What the hell are you thinking?

241
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,048
为什么打到这里来
Why are you calling me here?

242
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:03,075
打你手机  直接转到了语音信箱
I tried your cell, and it went straight to voice mail.

243
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,031
我还能怎么联系你
How else am I supposed to get hold of you?

244
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,009
不要联系我
You aren't.

245
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:07,080
都一整天了
Look, man, it's been a whole day.

246
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,006
还得要悲伤多久
How long is this grieving process?

247
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,090
干脆让我打卡下班算了
Just put a clock on it for me.

248
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:14,017
我只想说我们得按计划行事  对吧
All's I'm saying is we have a schedule, right?

249
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,067
我的家人比你的计划重要
My family comes before your schedule.

250
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:18,091
老兄  这可不是我的计划
Dude, it's not my schedule.

251
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:20,084
我们在此是有任务在身的
We have responsibilities here.

252
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:23,061
我心里有数
I'll get there when I get there.

253
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,046
随你便
You know what? Whatever.

254
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,003
我自己制毒
I'll just cook on my own.

255
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,047
不行
You will do no such thing.

256
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,050
为什么不行
Why not?

257
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:33,091
作为新手
Well, uh, for starters,

258
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,065
你根本不懂怎么操作那些设备
you aren't the least bit familiar with any of the equipment.

259
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:39,034
总有说明书之类的吧
There's got to be some sort of manual, right?

260
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,074
我认识字
And I can read.

261
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:42,058
杰西  什么都别碰
Jesse, touch nothing.

262
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,002
行了  别把我当助手那样使唤
Yo, stop treating me I'm like your assistant.

263
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,075
我可不听你发号施令
I'm not your bitch to order around.

264
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,099
我们是合伙人关系
We're partners.

265
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,032
知道吗
Remember?

266
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:53,046
坐着耐心地等我
I need you to sit patiently and wait,

267
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:55,043
我会尽快赶到
and I will be there as soon as I can.

268
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:57,059
谢谢你的关心
Thank you very much for your kind words.

269
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:59,056
我们...非常感谢
We-- We really do appreciate that.

270
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,027
怎么   你妻子在旁边
What, is your wife there?

271
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,053
是的  她在
Uh, yes. Yes, she is,

272
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:06,047
而且她会很高兴你能打电话来问候
and she would be happy to know that you asked about her.

273
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,047
保持联络
And please do keep us in your thoughts.

274
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:10,040
告诉你那混蛋连襟
Hey, tell your douche-bag brother-in-law

275
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,098
早点超度算了
to head towards the light.

276
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,091
我在想
So I'm thinking, um,

277
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,095
不如大家一起去吃个早饭
maybe we should go get everybody some breakfast.

278
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,082
好啊  主意不错
Yeah. That sounds good.

279
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:22,065
知道刚才是谁吗
Do you know who that was?

280
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:42,056
我说  煎蛋还不错
You know, these eggs are really not too bad.

281
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,062
你们看
Look at that.

282
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,099
看什么
Look at what?

283
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:02,033
看什么  看这个  叉子上的斑点
At what? This. These spots.

284
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:05,020
这叉子明显是脏的
This fork is absolutely filthy.

285
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,034
你看到了吧
Tell me you see this.

286
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:13,007
你眼神好  看看这个
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

287
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,094
玛丽  只不过是水渍而已
Marie, those are just water spots.

288
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,051
叉子没问题
Fork is fine.

289
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:20,011
才不是水渍
Those are not water spots.

290
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:22,048
明明是脏的
That's dirt.

291
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:26,015
这餐具明显没洗过
This silverware's obviously not been cleaned.

292
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:29,042
满是别人口腔里的病菌
It's covered in germs from someone else's mouth.

293
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:31,046
天知道什么鬼东西
God knows what.

294
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:35,086
玛丽阿姨  真的是水渍
Seriously, Aunt Marie, it's water spots.

295
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:39,010
我们家里的叉子也不比这干净
Ours at home aren't any better.

296
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:41,033
这跟你们家的叉子无关
Yours at home are irrelevant.

297
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:42,086
我们这是在医院里
We're in a hospital.

298
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,064
医院的卫生水平应该更高
They need to be held to a higher standard.

299
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:46,027
这是他们的职责
They have a responsibility.

300
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,073
我不确定
Well, I'm not actually sure

301
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:50,029
这间自助餐厅是否可以算是
if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies

302
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,080
医院的一部分
as being part of a hospital.

303
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,060
它就在医院的大楼里
It's in the same building.

304
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:54,097
同一个屋檐下
It's all under the same roof.

305
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,044
病人们吃饭用的
Do you think that sick people aren't eating

306
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,064
不也是这沾染了细菌的餐具吗
with this bacteria-infected silverware?

307
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:02,051
上帝啊  病从口入  叫人怎么活
My God, how are you supposed to survive this death trap?

308
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,002
玛丽
Marie.

309
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:11,099
我不是活过来了吗
I survived.

310
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:16,006
我在这家医院做的肿瘤切除手术
I had my lumpectomy at this hospital.

311
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:17,026
记得吗
Remember that?

312
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:20,086
还记得当时我们有多害怕吗
Remember how scared we all were?

313
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,013
我不想表现出来而已
I didn't want to act like it,

314
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:27,064
可我真的吓坏了
but I was terrified.

315
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:31,014
整整一周  我脑子里想的都是
All that week, all I could think of was

316
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:35,051
他们会怎么把我的身体切开
how they were actually going to cut me open

317
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:42,002
把我与生俱来的一部分从体内取走
and take out a part of me that was with me my entire life.

318
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:44,042
这个念头挥之不去
I couldn't get that image out of my head.

319
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,086
我觉得最可怕的就是
I think the scariest part was when...

320
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,026
做手术准备的时候
they took me into pre-op,

321
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,073
躺在那里
lying there,

322
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:58,077
等着被麻醉
waiting for them to anesthetize you,

323
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
心里清楚
knowing that...

324
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:03,067
自己可能再也醒不过来了
you may never wake up again.

325
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:12,028
事实上
Actually,

326
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:17,089
我还记得那天开车来医院的时候
what I really remember about that day is driving to the hospital.

327
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:20,099
斯凯勒  记得吗  那天我要自己开车
Skyler, you remember me wanting to drive that day?

328
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:23,019
记得
Yeah.

329
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:27,033
反正  那天我们开车走中央公路的时候
Anyway, there we are. We're driving up Central,

330
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,070
每个路口都是绿灯
and we hit every green light...

331
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:33,040
我是说每个经过的路口
I mean, every single light that we hit...

332
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:36,000
都是绿灯
sheew... green.

333
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:39,051
这是什么概率
When does that happen?

334
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:43,085
就是  梆 梆
Just like bang, bang,

335
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:46,022
一路绿灯
green the entire way.

336
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:49,053
一路上  我一直都在想
And the whole time, all I could think about was

337
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:53,046
"为什么偏偏是今天  为什么"
"Why today? Why?

338
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,046
"为什么不能让我和家人"
"Why can't I just spend a few extra minutes

339
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,033
"在车里多坐一会儿"
"in the car with my family?"

340
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:05,043
我这辈子从没那么盼过堵车
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic so bad in my life.

341
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:09,027
至少那时我和家人在一起
At least I was with my family.

342
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,064
有家人支持
I had that.

343
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:22,092
不管怎么说  我活过来了
Anyway, I survived this place.

344
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:27,059
你丈夫比我强壮得多
And I'm not half the man your husband is.

345
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:56,089
你好
Yes?

346
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:59,011
你那边到底怎么回事

347
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:01,004
我正要问你呢
I was going to ask you the same question.

348
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,094
知道我的人出事了吗

349
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:06,089
听说他们袭击一名缉毒局探员
I heard they they attacked a DEA agent.

350
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:10,079
怎么回事  不会说西班牙语了吗

351
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:14,004
不是我下的命令
I didn't order this,

352
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,021
我的手下也不会擅自行事
and my men would never do this on their own.

353
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:18,085
一定是有人指使的
Someone gave the go-ahead.

354
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:21,055
你是在指责我吗
Are you accusing me?

355
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:24,082
我只是说他们不会自行其是
I'm just saying they wouldn't act on their own.

356
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:28,005
我也没有自取灭亡的习惯
I am not in the habit of picking my own pocket.

357
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:31,086
我估计下批到货要推迟了吧
I assume that the next shipment will be delayed.

358
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:33,083
货大概多久能到
Any thoughts on when it might arrive?

359
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:35,086
一周  或许一个月
A week, a month.

360
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,076
现在边境查得太严
There's too much focus on the border.

361
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,083
我们眼下需要暂时低调
We lay low for the time being.

362
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:41,027
低调行事
We lay low,

363
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,080
然后等活下来的那个  告诉我真相
and then we get the real story from my man who survived.

364
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:46,034
你的人被拘禁了
Your man is in custody.

365
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:48,034
上帝保佑美国

366
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:49,068
在宣判之前他都是无罪的
He's innocent until proven guilty.

367
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:50,074
不是吗
Correct?

368
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:52,078
我会给他请最好的律师
I'll get him the best lawyer,

369
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:55,008
然后会真相大白的
and then we'll learn the truth.

370
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:57,008
有消息随时通知我
Well, keep me apprised.

371
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:04,019
任何靠近脊柱的外伤
Any time you've got that close proximity to the spine,

372
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:05,086
都是需要谨慎对待的
there's always going to be cause for concern,

373
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,053
但我也说了
but, as I say,

374
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:09,020
现在下结论为时尚早
it's really too soon to tell.

375
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:12,010
至少他出了手术室  这算是...
He's out of surgery, at least, which is...

376
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:14,037
离开手术室  正被送往恢复室
Out of surgery, on his way to recovery.

377
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,097
好  恢复室在哪儿
All right. Where's that?

378
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,084
对不起  你现在还不能去看他
Unfortunately, you can't see him just yet.

379
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,014
需要等他情况稳定下来
We're gonna have to wait for him to stabilize.

380
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,044
还要多久
How long will that take?

381
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:24,024
这个不好说
I can't really say.

382
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:25,095
可能要几小时
Could be hours,

383
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:28,095
一旦可以探视  我们会立刻通知你
but we'll let you know just as soon as you could see him.

384
00:24:30,055 --> 00:24:31,058
谢谢
Thank you.

385
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:40,073
要不要我们送你回家睡会儿
Um, maybe we should get you home for a couple hours?

386
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:43,040
休息一下
Get some rest?

387
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:45,003
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

388
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,057
我也不走
Me, neither.

389
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,071
你们有谁特别想刷牙的吗
Well, is anyone else dying to brush their teeth,

390
00:24:57,074 --> 00:24:59,011
我想刷牙了
or is it just me?

391
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:04,005
我回家去拿些东西过来怎样
What if I ran over to the house and picked up a few things?

392
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:06,085
玛丽  我可以顺路去趟你家
Marie? I could swing by your place.

393
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,039
那太好了
That would be great.

394
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,049
谢谢  沃尔特
Thanks, Walt.

395
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,023
那好
Okay.

396
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:23,034
本德尔医生
Dr. Bender?

397
00:25:23,037 --> 00:25:24,067
本德尔医生
Dr. Bender.

398
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,058
沃尔特  沃尔特
Walt. Walt.

399
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,088
刚听说他挺过来了
We just heard he came through?

400
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:36,092
是的  情况算是...较为乐观吧
Yeah, well, it's, uh, you know, guardedly good news.

401
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:38,085
谢天谢地  这是好事
Thank God. I'll take it. Yeah.

402
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,095
各位  这是汉克的连襟  沃尔特
Hey, guys, this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

403
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:41,095
你好
Hi.

404
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,012
-你好  -你好
- Hello. - Hi.

405
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:46,013
我们在讲汉克的故事
We were just swapping Hank stories.

406
00:25:46,016 --> 00:25:48,023
是吗  那可...  够说一整天的
Oh, well, that could... that could go on all day.

407
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:50,040
天知道  他的故事太多了
God knows, there's a million of them.

408
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:53,023
这会儿...
Meanwhile...

409
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:55,053
该死的人渣
Miserable piece of shit.

410
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:56,094
开枪的杂种
Guy who shot him,

411
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:58,060
还活着  就在楼上
the one that's left, he's up there,

412
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:00,014
用着止疼药
got the painkillers going on,

413
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,024
舒舒服服地躺在那里
resting comfortably.

414
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:03,008
花的是纳税人的钱
Your tax dollars at work.

415
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:07,041
你该去看看汉克把那杂种弄成什么样了
You ought to see what Hank did to that bastard.

416
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,061
想看看吗
Want to see?

417
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:11,075
来吧  我带你去
Come on, let me show you.

418
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:17,092
可以吗
We can do this?

419
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:35,068
舒服吗  你个人渣
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

420
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,070
-抓住他了  -嗯
- You got him? - Yeah.

421
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,034
拉起来
Come on.

422
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,024
放松  放松
Easy, easy.

423
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:14,023
进去
Come on!

424
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,042
不爽
No.

425
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:38,020
给你一个  你...
One for you and you-- eh

426
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:28,094
你他妈终于来了
Finally. About damn time.

427
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,020
为什么没有制毒
Why isn't there anything cooking?

428
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:03,090
沃尔特·怀特  有你的电话
Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.

429
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:06,044
-接线员  -我是沃尔特·怀特
- Operator. - This is Walter White.

430
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:08,007
我帮你接过去
I'll connect you.

431
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:14,051
我们有麻烦了  大麻烦
Yo, we got problems, big ones.

432
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:18,068
雷弗里德  感谢你的电话再次来电
Reverend, so nice of you to call...again.

433
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,022
快点开手机
Turn your phone on already.

434
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:23,045
我一定会查明情况的
You know, I will definitely look into that.

435
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:25,014
这样吧
I'll tell you what. Why don't I

436
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:27,066
我现在就用手机打给你
just call you right back on my cell phone.

437
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:29,013
好吗
Okay?

438
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:32,031
我叫你要等我
I told you to wait.

439
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,028
都不知道跟你说过多少遍了
I don't know how many more ways I could say it.

440
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,025
是啊  混球 我一直在等
Yeah, dick, I was waiting,

441
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:39,015
然后那个阴森恐怖的闷头男来了
and then that creepy, quiet guy showed up.

442
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:41,028
古斯来了
Gus came by?

443
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:42,072
不是他  老兄
Not him, man.

444
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:44,082
显然我还不配和他见面
Apparently I'm not worthy of meeting him.

445
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:47,075
是另外一个  我够资格和他讲话那个
It was the other one, the one that I'm qualified to speak to.

446
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,036
然后他开始问我问题
Then he started asking questions, too,

447
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,079
问我为什么还没开始制毒
like why I haven't cooked anything.

448
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:55,046
根据定额  我们明天该交货了
We have a quota. It's due tomorrow.

449
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,030
你是真不管  还是什么
Do you seriously not care, or what?

450
00:30:57,033 --> 00:31:00,053
因为那家伙  他有双死神之眼
Because that guy, he's got, like, the dead eyes.

451
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:01,094
我问你件事
Let me ask you something.

452
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:04,077
你记不记得我们和屠库在沙漠那次
Do you remember when we were out in the desert with Tuco?

453
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:08,011
你是说他用机枪顶着我的头那次
Oh, you mean when he put a machine gun to my head?

454
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:11,008
记得  有点小印象  怎么了
Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell. Why?

455
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:13,008
不是那个  他当时一直说
No. He kept-- He kept saying

456
00:31:13,011 --> 00:31:15,035
在说  有人要
that-- that someone

457
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,058
从墨西哥来杀我们
was coming up from Mexico to get us.

458
00:31:17,062 --> 00:31:20,009
你还记得吗  他说的是什么人
Do you remember? Now, who was that?

459
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,092
这和现在有什么鸟关系
What the hell has this even got to do with--

460
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:24,082
我记不清了  是...呃...
Look, I don't know. It was, um--

461
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:29,080
他的堂兄弟
His cousins.

462
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:33,027
是不是  杰西  他的堂兄弟
Right, Jesse? It was his cousins.

463
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,084
是  堂兄弟
Yeah, cousins.

464
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:37,054
管他是谁  老兄  怎么了
Whatever, man. Why?

465
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:58,029
有消息吗
Any news?

466
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,076
还是老样子
No change.

467
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,070
好的  那个  我...
Okay. Well, I--

468
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:08,057
我不知道哪把牙刷是谁的  所以我...
I didn't know whose toothbrushes were whose, so I--

469
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,067
我路上去了药房[兼售杂货]
I just stopped by the drugstore.

470
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:15,034
幸好有旅行装的  对吧
Thank god for travel sizes, right?

471
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:18,014
-谢谢  -没事
- Thank you. - Yeah.

472
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:24,085
我想去洗洗脸
Oh, I think I'm going to go wash my face.

473
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:28,039
不然我要疯了
I'm going crazy.

474
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,099
你去吗
Do you want to come?

475
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:32,013
好的
Yeah.

476
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:49,048
我买了糖
I got candy bars.

477
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:56,058
你是让我给你带这个吧
Is this what you were asking for?

478
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:58,079
对
Yeah.

479
00:32:58,082 --> 00:33:02,016
我浏览了一下
Yeah, I-- I skimmed through it.

480
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,052
好像挺有意思
Looks interesting.

481
00:33:03,056 --> 00:33:04,072
是的
Yeah.

482
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:08,009
汉克叔叔送我的
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

483
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,063
讲什么的
What's it about?

484
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:18,020
巴勃罗·埃斯科瓦尔
Pablo Escobar,

485
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:20,099
八十年代的大毒枭
this big drug guy in the '80s.

486
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,094
哦  我记得在新闻里看见过他
Yeah. Yeah, I remember seeing him on the news.

487
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:30,012
不过  这本书更多的是写那些调查他
Well, it's more about the guys who investigated him

488
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:32,082
想将他绳之以法的人
and tried to bring him down.

489
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:35,092
其中就有缉毒局的  你知道吗
Some of them were DEA, you know?

490
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:40,092
汉克叔叔说值得被世人所了解
Uncle Hank said that they were worth learning about,

491
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,066
大家都知道巴勃罗·埃斯科瓦尔
that everybody knows who Pablo Escobar is,

492
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,063
但没人知道那些抓住他的人
but nobody knows about the guys that brought him down.

493
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:52,011
我想我从未想过这些
I guess I never thought about it.

494
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:59,028
他说书里描写好人
He said that good guys

495
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:01,058
的笔墨永远没有坏人的多
never get ink like the bad guys do.

496
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:13,063
所以他给了我这本书
So he gave it to me.

497
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:15,063
觉得我应该读一读
Figured I'd read it.

498
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:32,061
我  我得去...
Uh, I-- I need to--

499
00:34:32,065 --> 00:34:34,058
-一会儿就回来  好吗  -好
- I'll be right back, okay? - Ok.

500
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,096
不  我向你保证  我们很努力
No, I assure you. We are hard at work.

501
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:46,016
这一点绝对不用担心
Absolutely.

502
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:50,023
那么我可以期待着  明天按计划收到货了
So I can expect delivery by tomorrow as scheduled.

503
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:52,057
这个
Well, uh--

504
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,033
恐怕不行了
No. Unfortunately--

505
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:57,097
恐怕我们这周不能够
Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to

506
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:00,037
按计划完成了
keep our schedule this week.

507
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,091
但不是因为偷懒
But not for lack of trying.

508
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:05,004
有什么情况我需要知道吗
Is there something I should know?

509
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:10,002
和你说个大实话吧
Well, to be completely honest with you...

510
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:12,059
盖尔真的害惨了我们
Gale really screwed us up.

511
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:14,045
当然不是故意的
I mean, not on purpose, of course,

512
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:16,079
但是他  他拖了我们的后腿
but he just-- he set us way back,

513
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:20,083
到现在我们一直都在赶工
and we've been playing catch-up ever since.

514
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:24,086
还有  我不得不出去办点事
And I've had to be out running errands

515
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,070
好让我们达到预期目标
and trying to keep us on target.

516
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:30,044
有几样设备
Some of the equipment

517
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:32,021
校准出了差错  然后...
wasn't calibrated correctly and--

518
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:35,044
其实都是些无聊的技术问题
Well, it's just all very technical and boring,

519
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:38,068
但是请放心
but rest assured that--

520
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:41,005
我们会不遗余力地去做
that we will do whatever it takes.

521
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,065
我的全部精力都放在这上面
It has my total attention.

522
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:45,089
如有必要我们会周末加班
We'll cook through the weekend if necessary.

523
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:50,026
下周前我们会给你做好四百磅
We will have 400 pounds for you by next week.

524
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:56,036
说话算数吗
I have your word on that?

525
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,070
当然
You do.

526
00:35:57,073 --> 00:36:01,037
我向你保证
You have my word on that.

527
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,094
谢谢你告知进展
Thank you for the update.

528
00:36:30,036 --> 00:36:32,003
有消息了
Any news?

529
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:35,097
没  我只是在瞎转转
Nah, I'm just-- just wandering.

530
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
你那边怎么样
How's everybody doing?

531
00:36:38,004 --> 00:36:41,067
还算好吧
Well, as well as can be expected.

532
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:44,094
我感觉  在那边
It's this not knowing

533
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:46,085
手足无措的等待消息 才是最煎熬的
that's the hardest part, I think.

534
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:51,038
查出这些家伙的来历了吗
Anything new on these guys?

535
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,042
他们是什么人  想要干什么
Who they are? What they wanted?

536
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,059
没有  还没有头绪
No, nothing yet,

537
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:57,059
不过会查清楚的
but we'll get it.

538
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,096
史蒂芬
Steve...

539
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,017
你认为还会再有杀手来吗
Do you think there could maybe be others?

540
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:12,037
伙计  不会有人来杀汉克了
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

541
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,081
他们只有这一次机会  但他们没得逞
That was their one shot, and they blew it.

542
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:16,068
所以  不会了
So, no.

543
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:20,018
没可能了
No way.

544
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,068
上帝
Jesus.

545
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:24,042
我真想走进去
I'd love to walk in there

546
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:26,042
一枪射穿那混蛋的脑袋
and shoot that bastard right in the head.

547
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:27,085
我也是
Me, too.

548
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:37,046
说
Yeah.

549
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,007
是吗
Oh, yeah?

550
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,080
太棒了  我们马上下来
Great. We'll be right down.

551
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:44,044
吃的到了
Food's here.

552
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:46,027
你喜欢吃洛博罗炸鸡吗
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

553
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:51,021
还行
Uh, on occasion, yeah.

554
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,011
那儿的老板是缉毒局的资助商之一
Owner's a big booster for the DEA.

555
00:37:53,015 --> 00:37:54,024
他听说这事了
He heard what happened.

556
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,038
要带晚餐来给这里所有的警察
He's going to feed every cop in the building.

557
00:37:57,082 --> 00:37:59,059
那真是太棒了
That's-- That's wonderful.

558
00:37:59,062 --> 00:38:02,036
是啊  而且是他亲自送来的
Yeah, and apparently he's bringing it by personally.

559
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,046
很好吃  对吧
Good, huh?

560
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:18,045
没错
Delicious.

561
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:21,066
您真是太慷慨了  非常感谢
That's so generous of you. Thank you very much.

562
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:23,016
没错  谢谢
Yes, thank you.

563
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:24,033
你们听到了吗
Guys, did you hear that?

564
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:27,003
福林先生要悬赏一万元
Mr. Fring is offering a $10,000 reward

565
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:29,003
给任何能够提供线索的人
on any information about the case.

566
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,064
是吗  真是太好了
Well, that's-- that's wonderful.

567
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:35,020
谢谢  福林先生
Wow. Thank you, Mr. Fring.

568
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,004
不客气
You're very welcome.

569
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,011
正是因为有像你丈夫这样的人
Men like your husband are the thin blue line

570
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:41,024
才使我们免受那些人渣的侵害
between us and these animals.

571
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,038
我希望我能做得更多
I only wish I could do more.

572
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:50,045
我们很感谢您的支持
Well, we do appreciate your support.

573
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:52,099
那笔赏金可以帮我们扭转局势
This reward could turn the tide here.

574
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:55,069
帮助很大
It'll really help.

575
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:59,016
本人再次对此次袭击深表遗憾
Again, I can't express how sorry I am.

576
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,046
碰巧  我和施拉德探员有过一面之缘
As it happens, I actually met Agent Schrader.

577
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,060
真的吗
Really?

578
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:06,084
几个月前  在募捐的时候
Our fun run, a couple months ago.

579
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:10,024
福林先生是我们的资助商之一
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

580
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:14,008
我和你丈夫聊过几句
I talked for a few minutes with your husband.

581
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:17,081
并且他还提到了你  怀特先生
As a matter of fact, Mr. White, your name came up.

582
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:22,054
真的吗
Really? Huh.

583
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:27,012
没错  因为刚好有个为你筹款的收集罐
Yeah, there happened to be a collection jar out for you,

584
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,096
所以我大概了解了一下你的健康状况
and we spoke briefly about your health concerns.

585
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,043
我希望现在情况已经好转了
I hope that there's been good news.

586
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:38,030
没错  是的  情况好多了
Uh, yeah, things have improved, yes.

587
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:40,060
真是好消息
That's wonderful to hear.

588
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:44,017
很明显看得出他非常关心你
It was clear to me how deeply he cares for you.

589
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:50,038
好了  我想我该走了
Well, I've taken up enough of your time.

590
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:54,078
再次感谢您
Um... thank you again very much.

591
00:39:54,082 --> 00:39:56,029
很高兴认识您
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

592
00:39:56,032 --> 00:39:58,045
-谢谢  -谢谢你
- Thank you. - Yes, thank you.

593
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:02,089
-我送你出去  -不  不用麻烦了
- Let me walk you out. - Oh-- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

594
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:12,084
我忘了跟他道谢
You know, I didn't say thank you.

595
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:13,097
我去送他走
I'll walk him out.

596
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,047
马上回来
I'll be right back.

597
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:20,044
你好
Good to see you.

598
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,011
鸡肉好吃吗
Enjoying the chicken?

599
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:24,015
很好  很好
Good. Good

600
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:26,042
不用谢  我的荣幸
Oh, you're very welcome. My pleasure.

601
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,065
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

602
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:31,022
-鸡肉不错吧  -没错
- It's good chicken, huh? - Yeah.

603
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:32,052
-那就好  -福林先生
- Good. - Mr. Fring.

604
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,009
-我能  -怀特先生
- May I-- - Mr. White.

605
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,089
我只想再次感谢你
I just wanted to thank you again.

606
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:37,039
别客气  我的荣幸
Oh, it's my pleasure.

607
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:39,076
我能  我能和你谈谈吗
Uh, may I-- may I speak with you?

608
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,013
一下就好
Just a moment?

609
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:47,094
你知道
You knew.

610
00:40:47,097 --> 00:40:50,051
你知道我的连襟是缉毒局的人
You knew my brother-in-law was with the DEA.

611
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:54,088
我会调查所有和我合作的人
I investigate everyone with whom I do business.

612
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:57,075
这就叫做谨慎
What careful man wouldn't?

613
00:40:58,031 --> 00:41:00,068
他对我们  对我们的工作来说
He is not a problem for us,

614
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:02,075
并不是问题
for our business.

615
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:08,096
你来这儿
Your being here is--

616
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:12,056
你来这儿是想传达什么信息吗
Is this some sort of message?

617
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,096
我是来支持我资助的团体的
I'm supporting my community.

618
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,080
我和你一样  也要掩藏身份
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

619
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:19,003
满意了吗
Are we done?

620
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:20,007
不  不  听我说
No-- No, listen, I--

621
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,044
我连襟遭到攻击的事
This attack on my brother-in-law--

622
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:23,057
我不明白
I don't-- I don't understand it.

623
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:25,047
我不明白是什么意思
I don't know what it means.

624
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:29,075
拜托了  如果你知道些什么
Please, if you have some knowledge

625
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:31,028
可以告诉我的话
that you could share with me.

626
00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:39,046
我为我的家人感到担心
I fear for my family.

627
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:40,059
我保证他们会没事的
I'm sure they'll be fine.

628
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:43,016
我听说那个幸存的歹徒
I am told the assassin that survived

629
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:44,066
受了重伤
is gravely injured.

630
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:46,046
我想他可能也活不久了
It's doubtful he'll live.

631
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,040
好了  说谢谢然后和我握手
Now thank me and shake my hand.

632
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:59,031
谢谢你  感激不尽
Uh-- thank you. Thank you again.

633
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:01,034
别客气  怀特先生
You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

634
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:15,002
出什么事了
What's going on?

635
00:42:15,006 --> 00:42:16,083
怎么了
What's happening?

636
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:17,086
开始按压胸部
Starting chest compressions.

637
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:19,060
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

638
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,053
-一  二  三  -要心跳颤动器吗
- One, two, three-- - Defib?

639
00:42:22,057 --> 00:42:24,007
没有理由  病人挺不住了
No reason. Patient isn't insistently.

640
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,007
继续按压胸部
Continuing chest compressions.

641
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,084
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

642
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,062
给我一升生理盐水
Give me a liter of saline wide open.

643
00:42:29,062 --> 00:42:30,021
没有脉搏
I can't get a pulse back.

644
00:42:30,024 --> 00:42:31,091
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

645
00:42:31,094 --> 00:42:33,044
还是没有反应  一  二  三
Still nothing. One, two, three--

646
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:35,044
好了  停止按压
All right. Stopping compressions.

647
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:36,071
时间
Time.

648
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:38,005
八点四十三分
8:43.

649
00:42:38,008 --> 00:42:39,095
死亡时间  晚上八点四十三分
Time of death. 20:43.

650
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:44,035
下地狱吧  你这个人渣
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

651
00:43:11,015 --> 00:43:12,088
你好  胡安
Yes? Juan?

652
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:14,095
我想你已经听到消息了
I assume you heard the news.

653
00:43:14,098 --> 00:43:17,085
你的人死了  我听说了
Your man died. I heard.

654
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:18,099
很遗憾
It's unfortunate.

655
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:20,036
是啊  很遗憾
Yeah, "Unfortunate,"

656
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,043
而且我还被联邦探员包围了
and meanwhile I have Federales surrounding my house.

657
00:43:23,046 --> 00:43:25,076
你知道我在想什么吗  古斯塔沃
You know what I think, Gustavo?

658
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,068
我觉得一切都是你搞的鬼
I think you're behind all this.

659
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:31,008
为什么是我  对我有什么好处
Why would I do this? How would it serve me?

660
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,004
这就是我想知道的
That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

661
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:36,017
也许你想只手遮天呢
Go off on your own, maybe.

662
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,077
你以为这会有用吗
Would you actually think that would work?

663
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,084
胡安  你听起来很紧张
Juan, you sound like you're under a lot of stress.

664
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:42,021
也许该等你头脑
Maybe you should call me back

665
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:43,068
清醒一点的时候  再打给我
when you're seeing things more clearly.

666
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:45,055
我够清醒了
I see things clear enough.

667
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:49,025
一个缉毒局的人中了枪  就惊动华盛顿方面了吗
One DEA gets shot. All of Washington starts barking.

668
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:51,045
还连带墨西哥联邦特区  搞出这么大声势
The D.F. Suddenly has to put on a big show,

669
00:43:51,049 --> 00:43:54,046
让我和我的盟友[西]都寝食难安
and I wind up with Federas in my rose bushes.

670
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,026
但这只是暂时的
But just for a while.

671
00:43:56,029 --> 00:44:00,073
很明显是政治斗争罢了
Appearances, politics.

672
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:02,080
你还在听吗  古斯塔沃
Are you still there, Gustavo?

673
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:05,093
嗯  我在
Yes, I'm here.

674
00:44:05,097 --> 00:44:08,064
我会撑住的  我总能撑过去
I'll weather this. I always do.

675
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:10,054
我弟弟是警长
My brother's a police chief.

676
00:44:10,057 --> 00:44:13,014
我会去疏通关系  让他们帮我逃过此劫
I got connections. They'll get me through.

677
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,058
并且我会找到证据
And when I get proof

678
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:18,098
让其他人都知道你干的好事
and the others find out what you've done,

679
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:21,085
到那时  我们再好好"聊聊"
maybe we come pay you a visit.

680
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:24,015
也许我们...
Maybe we can...

681
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:12,087
斯凯勒  醒醒
Skyler. Skyler.

682
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,067
醒醒  玛丽
Marie. Marie.

683
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:18,094
他怎么样了  给我们点好消息
Oh, how is he? Tell me something good.

684
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:21,094
病人情况已经稳定  你们可以去看他了
I think he's stable enough now for you to go see him briefly.

685
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:25,019
很抱歉  直系亲属才可以进去
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid it's immediate family only.

686
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:26,041
我们都是他的家人
We're all family.

687
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,012
我理解
I understand,

688
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:30,021
但我们有明确的规定  我们得...
but we have a certain protocol here that we need--

689
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:32,065
我们都是他的家人
We're all family.
