1
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,010
不知道它们从哪跑出来的  你得帮我们
Came out of nowhere. You gotta help us.

2
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,600
你看这些脏水
Look at all this damn water.

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,300
千万别喝
Don't drink that.

4
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,770
说不定是有毒的
Ain't no telling what's gonna be poison.

5
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:48,910
第四季 第七集
S04E07: Problem Dog

6
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,370
儿子怎么样了
How's Junior?

7
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,009
和我预计的一样
Oh, exactly what I expected.

8
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,060
自从我们说要退掉车之后
He hasn't said a word to me

9
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,370
他一句话都没和我说过
since we told him it was going back.

10
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,110
我和车行谈过了  他们不同意退车
I spoke to the dealership. They didn't want to take it.

11
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,410
什么
What?

12
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,279
这车的车况这么好
It's in perfect condition.

13
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,609
而且只跑了17英里
It's got 17 miles on the odometer.

14
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,880
我知道  我说了一个小时的好话
I know. I spent the better part of an hour

15
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,650
才让经理把退订费降到
sweet-talking the manager down to a restocking fee--

16
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,010
800块
$800.

17
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,610
才2天就要800块
$800... for two days?

18
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,180
根据法律来说  他们有权利拒绝退车
Well, the law says they don't have to take it back at all.

19
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,500
好了  这是登记表
All right, here's the registration,

20
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,520
标签还有收据
and the window sticker, the receipt.

21
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,209
记得一定要找那个总经理
Oh, and make sure you talk to the general manager.

22
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,479
他叫格伦
His name is Glen.

23
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,790
格伦
Glen.

24
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,260
有什么事就打给我
Call me if there's a problem.

25
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,120
还有拜托你
And please, just don't--

26
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,730
不要和任何人争执
don't tangle with anyone.

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,520
好吧
Fine.

28
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,450
很好  马丁  非常好
Oh! Bueno, Martine. Muy bueno.

29
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,590
沃尔特
Walt.

30
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,310
妈的
Shit.

31
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
喂  你好
Yes. Hello.

32
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,260
我需要一辆出租车
I need a cab.

33
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,930
对  谢谢  我叫怀特
Yes, thank you. The name is White.

34
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,890
我在大学城的展览馆停车场
Uh, I'm at the Pavilion parking lot on University.

35
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,530
对  没错  就在机场南边
Oh, yes, that's right. Just south of the airport.

36
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,430
太好了  谢谢
Oh, that'd be great. Thank you.

37
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,560
大概多久能到
Oh, how long do you think that would take.

38
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,990
不用  他肯定能找到我的
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

39
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,160
谢谢
Thank you.

40
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
有没有悔过
Contrition?

41
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,130
当然有
Hey, there's--

42
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
彻底的悔过
There's total contrition here!

43
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,690
简直后悔死了
There's mountains of contrition!

44
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,330
太  太好了
Fan-tan-tastic!

45
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,059
我现在就把钱送过去
I will messenger 'em over right away.

46
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,330
还有
Oh, and--

47
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,550
关于那件事
...about that other thing unrelated--

48
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,109
我可以让你加入
Yes, I can get you in.

49
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,010
但我得警告你  第八洞简直不是人打的
But I gotta warn you, the eighth hole is murder.

50
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,720
是吗  你就想来点刺激的
Oh, yeah? You want to make it interesting?

51
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,890
太棒了  早上7点准时开球
Great! Tee time 7 A.M. Sharp.

52
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,850
准备输得屁滚尿流吧你
Prepare to have your ass handed to you.

53
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,290
好的  再见
Okay. Bye.

54
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,170
他本来要告你毁坏公物
He was headed for destruction of property,

55
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,020
但既然那车是你的
but since it's your own property,

56
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,050
我让他改成轻罪  乱烧垃圾
I sweated him down to misdemeanor trash burning.

57
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,600
唯一的问题就是要花不少钱
The only thing is, it's not gonna be free.

58
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,520
罚金5000块
There's a 5 grand fine,

59
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,390
拖车和清理现场600块
600 for towing and disposal,

60
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,950
蒸汽清洗柏油路3000块
another 3 grand to steam clean the blacktop.

61
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,950
所以你这小小的飙车之旅要花掉你
So bottom line, your little joyride's gonna set you back

62
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,690
大概52000块
about 52,000 bucks, so...

63
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,990
你觉得值吗
was it worth it?

64
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,820
我不想听这些废话
I don't need to hear the blow-by-blow.

65
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,890
直接告诉我问题解决了
Just tell me it's done.

66
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,090
不好意思  我吵醒你了吗
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

67
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,290
我在这事闹大之前就帮你摆平了
I caught this thing before it got into the system.

68
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,790
所以你不会有案底
That means your record stays clean.

69
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,990
你老婆也永远不会发现
The wife never finds out.

70
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,320
这是见证奇迹的时刻
I've been working magic here.

71
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,920
至少夸我一下吧
I can at least get an "Attaboy."

72
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,990
好吧  你自己生闷气去吧
Fine. Rebel without a cause,

73
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,320
袋子给我
give.

74
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,170
到底什么事  关于福林吗
What is it, Fring?

75
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,690
他会干掉我
He will see me dead...

76
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,220
我却束手无策
and there's nothing I can do about it.

77
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,120
只能坐以待毙
All that's left is to wait.

78
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,250
你确定吗
And we're sure about this.

79
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,190
平克曼说他很需要你
'Cause Pinkman says he needs you too much.

80
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,550
"平克曼说"
"Pinkman says."

81
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,090
"平克曼说"
"Pinkman says."

82
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,990
除非
Unless...

83
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,820
你能给我找个帮手
you could help me find a third party.

84
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,980
什么帮手
What third party?

85
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,790
能帮我改善情势的人
Someone who can ameliorate the situation.

86
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,320
说得明白点行不行
Let's ditch the thesaurus, all right?

87
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,590
你是想找个杀手吗
You talking about a hit man?

88
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,020
如果他们还叫这名字的话
Assuming that's still what they're called.

89
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,020
回答错误
Zzzzt! Wrong answer!

90
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,850
用年轻的人话来说就是扯淡
That's what the kids call "Epic fail."

91
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,730
你只要给我一个号码
All I would need is a phone number.

92
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,890
剩下的我来做就行
I would do the rest.

93
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,550
索尔  我会付你钱的
Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.

94
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,850
一大笔钱
A big one.

95
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,850
如果你一定要的话
Look, if you held my feet to the fire,

96
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,720
我可以帮你找一两个西洛基山的人
I could come up with a couple names one or two guys west of the Rockies

97
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,820
帮你做这事
who do this kind of work

98
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,220
但你知道吗
but guess what.

99
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,050
这些人  他们都认识麦克
These guys? They know Mike.

100
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,690
麦克也认识他们
And Mike knows them.

101
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,220
你是说
What are you telling me?

102
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,790
麦克认识所有干这行的人
Mike knows everyone who does this?

103
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,520
你以为是谁介绍他们给我的
Who do you think gave me their names?

104
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,520
好吧  备选方案
Okay, Plan B.

105
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,350
不找我认识的人
Look, we go outside my network--

106
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,350
从广告或者佣兵
Craigslist, Soldier of Fortune.

107
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,920
就算我们运气好
Let's say we get lucky,

108
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,370
超级超级好
I mean, incredibly lucky,

109
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,690
找到一个既不是卧底警察
and find a guy who's not an undercover cop

110
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,690
也不是疯子的人
or some kind of survivalist nut-job wannabe.

111
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,890
你得问问自己  到底怎样才算好
You gotta ask yourself-- How good is good enough?

112
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,560
不管我们找到什么人
Because whatever goomba we buy

113
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,350
到最后那人都会遇上我们的朋友
at some point is gonna come head-to-head

114
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,420
麦克
with our friend Mike.

115
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,220
至于  古斯・福林
And Gus Fring?

116
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,820
干掉他
Just winging that guy

117
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,520
根本不会"改善你的情势"
is not gonna ameliorate your situation,

118
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,420
一点也不会
not by a damn sight.

119
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,920
我想自己解决  但我根本见不到他
I tried to slove this myself, but I can't get anywhere near him.

120
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,390
你见不到他
You can't get near him?

121
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,750
去问问你的搭档吧
Why don't you ask your partner?

122
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,490
是  我见过他
Yeah, I saw him.

123
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,340
你告诉索尔都不告诉我
And you tell Saul before you tell me?

124
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,790
他也是我律师  和你一样
Look, he's my lawyer, same as yours.

125
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,490
每次我过去
Every time I go over there,

126
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,250
他都要和问我麦克的事
Saul hassles me about Mike.

127
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,190
他还在害怕有一天他会过去打断他的腿
He's still scared the dude's gonna come break his legs.

128
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,050
所以这些事我都告诉他
So I give him the latest.

129
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,220
到底怎么回事
But what happened exactly?

130
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,620
我在和麦克吃晚餐
I was at a diner with Mike,

131
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,520
他突然出现
and he just shows up.

132
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,050
他们让我出去  然后自己在里面谈
They send me outside and the two of them talk.

133
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,220
就这样
That's it.

134
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,140
这是他们定期的见面吗
So this is like a regular thing?

135
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,250
你离他有多近
How close were you to him?

136
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,790
很近
Close.

137
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,790
比咱俩现在这样还近
Closer than you and me right now.

138
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,620
他和你说话了么
Did he speak to you?

139
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,840
只说了不到10秒
It was over in 10 seconds.

140
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,850
回答我的问题
Would you just answer?

141
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,290
他说他看人很准
He said he sees things in people.

142
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,320
什么事  看什么人
What things? What people?

143
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,820
看我
Me.

144
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,350
他说他能看到我的潜力
He said he sees something in me.

145
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,550
一个月前
A month ago,

146
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,790
古斯还想杀了咱俩
Gus was trying to kill both of us,

147
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,890
现在他把你调出实验室
and now he pulls you out of the lab

148
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,720
然后把你当做好像
and employs you as...

149
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,020
好像  二号枪手
what, an assistant gunman?

150
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,120
还是硬汉人物
A tough guy?

151
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,250
你不觉得很奇怪吗
Does that make any sense to you?

152
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,990
他说他能看到你的潜力
He says he sees something in you.

153
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,550
他到底在玩什么把戏
What kind of game is he playing?

154
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,620
以为你真的那么天真吗
Does he think you're that naive?

155
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,990
他不会真的相信你已经忘了
He can't truly think that you'd forget--

156
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,290
好吧  撇开盖尔不谈
Well, let alone Gale,

157
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,210
也不说维克托
let alone Victor,

158
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,720
也别谈那些随之而来的可怕经历
and all the horror that goes along with all of that.

159
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,450
你的女朋友
What about this girlfriend of yours

160
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,890
还有她的那位小弟弟呢
and her little brother?

161
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,950
那男人看着你的眼睛
The man looked you straight in the eye

162
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,990
对你说  不会再用小孩子了
and told you "No more children,"

163
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,320
可就在那晚  那小男孩
but that very night, that little boy...

164
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,450
就这么死了
he winds up...

165
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,190
古斯不会真认为你忘了那些了吧
Gus can't possibly think that you'd forget that.

166
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,850
-行了  -我说这些是为了证明
- Okay. - I mean, all I'm saying is that

167
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,800
他不会真的以为你的意志那么薄弱吧
is it possible he would think that you're that weak-willed?

168
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,750
别摆出那副宣传的强调
Drop the sales pitch.

169
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,450
我会做的
I'll do it.

170
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,100
那你会做什么
You'll do what?

171
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,750
我会杀了他的
I'll kill him...

172
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,320
只要一有机会就会下手
First chance I'll get.

173
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,650
菠萝香味  闻起来更像变质的泡泡糖
Pina colada? More like stale bubblegum.

174
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,440
真有人希望他们的车闻起来
Does anyone actually want their car to smell like

175
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,620
像一个六年级孩子的课桌
the bottom of a sixth-grader's desk?

176
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,920
好吧  大麻味  不会吧
Okay. Hemp? Really?

177
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,620
我知道  可你知道那句话
Yeah, I know. But you know what they say--

178
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,039
顾客永远是对的
the customer's always right.

179
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,010
说到顾客
Ooh! Speaking of customer,

180
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,110
现在开一个盛大的开业仪式还来得及
it's not too late to have a grand opening.

181
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,540
举办一个大型派对  到处都是气球
I was thinking huge party, balloons,

182
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,890
还有孩子玩的蹦蹦床
bouncy house for the kids,

183
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,810
引起轰动  顺便上个电视
you know, make a splash, get on TV.

184
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,620
让人们知道他们进来后
Let people know they're not gonna have to face

185
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,100
不会遭遇冷颜相对
the eyebrows of doom when they come in.

186
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,210
玛丽  汉克最近怎样
Marie, how's Hank doing?

187
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,090
你猜怎么着  他比以前好多了
You know what? He's doing better.

188
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,970
真的吗
Really?

189
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,740
没错
Yeah. Uh...

190
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,240
最近他的心情大好
Lately his mood's improved,

191
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,670
他像疯了一样做那些物理治疗
and he's like a maniac with his P.T.

192
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,510
-那太好了  -是的  不过别理解错了
- That's fantastic. - Yeah, don't get me wrong.

193
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,470
他离完全恢复还差很远  可他
He's got a long way to go, but he--

194
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,770
我懂  我是说
Yeah. I mean--

195
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,310
-你好啊  沃尔特  -玛丽
- Hi, Walt. - Marie.

196
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,480
-见到你真好  -见到你也一样
- It's good to see you. - You, too.

197
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,230
你的这个收银员可是能说会道
Hey, your cashier here is quite the salesperson.

198
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,910
她刚说的我对车子的
She just talked me into something called

199
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,970
全身上蜡感兴趣了
the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

200
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,010
当然  对汽车外漆的保养可是很重要的
Oh, yeah. No, it's very important to maintain your clear coat.

201
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,970
要是一旦保护层没了
Boy, once that goes--

202
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,110
的确
Oh, yeah.

203
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,740
博格丹时期高峰时段平均每小时19辆车
Bogdan was averaging 19 cars during rush hour,

204
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,910
而现在我们已经提高到22辆
and we are already up to 22--

205
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,640
22辆车
22 actual cars.

206
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,810
昨晚  我们挣了3800美元
Lat night, I depoted $3,800.

207
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,410
上帝  这里有多少钱
Jesus. How much is that?

208
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,670
27万4千美元
$274,000.

209
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,210
应该有些误差
Give or take.

210
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,410
-有误差  -没错
- Give or take? - Yeah.

211
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,870
我没准确数过
I haven't counted it.

212
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,470
等等
Wait...

213
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:35,270
27万4千美元  多久一次
274,000-- And this is how often?

214
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,810
每两个礼拜
Every two weeks.

215
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,810
礼拜四方便来放钱吗
Thursday's good for a drop-off?

216
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,410
等等  沃尔特
Wait, Walt.

217
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,970
难道你是在说
Are you telling me

218
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:50,010
一年能挣七百一十二万美元
you make $7,125,000 a year?

219
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,640
应该是七百五十万
7 1/2 even,

220
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,510
在开销之前
before expenses.

221
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,140
可我不能
But I can't--

222
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,370
这太多了
This is too much.

223
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,298
看来是比你想象的多
So it's more than you thought,

224
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,760
是个坏消息喽
and this is somehow bad news?

225
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,490
不  重点不是这个
No, that's not the point.

226
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,990
我是说  世界上没有哪一个洗车房
I mean, there is no car wash in the world

227
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,420
能做这样的生意
that could do this kind of business.

228
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,780
这需要最少九个月的工作
I mean, this is 9 month's work here minimum.

229
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,554
能赚7百万  那起码得好几年
7 million? That could take years.

230
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:24,820
那就存着一些  以备不时之需
So set some aside. Save it for a rainy day.

231
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,820
存着  你说什么
Save it. What--

232
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,220
存到哪里  我又不能去银行存
Save it where? I can't go to the bank with it.

233
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,990
也不能保存在这里
I sure can't leave it here.

234
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,030
等等  都是50美元大钞
Wait a minute. Is this all 50s?

235
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,630
谁洗车付50美元
Who pays for a car wash with a 50?

236
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,020
斯凯勒  我没有要求你这么做
Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.

237
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,590
我原以为
I was under the impression

238
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,100
你能控制大局
that you had this under control.

239
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,006
可我没想到这么多钱
I just didn't expect this amount of money.

240
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,846
50美元大钞会是个问题
The 50s are gonna be a problem.

241
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,060
好吧  那就开始解决问题吧
Well, that's what this is-- problem solving.

242
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,540
斯凯勒  我们分工很明确
Skyler, this is a simple division of labor.

243
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,290
我赚钱  你洗钱
I bring in the money, you launder the money.

244
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,660
是你想这么做的
This is what you wanted.

245
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,220
我从来没想做这些
I never wanted any of this.

246
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,420
我得走了
I've got to go.

247
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,160
要是你想退出  就说出来
If you want out, just say that you want out.

248
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,860
这不结了
Okay, then.

249
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,620
你是说你在实验室做的这个
You're telling me you made this in the lab?

250
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
怎么不行
Why not?

251
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,410
在他自己的实验室里制作
Making it in his own lab...

252
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,520
合情合理
seemed appropriate.

253
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,902
量不多啊
There's not much of it.

254
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,510
对付屠库用的比这多
We had more for Tuco.

255
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,410
这些足够了
It's enough.

256
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,790
这还是最妙的办法
This is still the best way.

257
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,250
你提着枪去杀他
You go after him with a gun,

258
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,860
根本不可能活着回来
you'll never get out of it alive.

259
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,900
但是有了这个
But with this,

260
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,230
你只要把这个倒进他的食物或者饮料中
you slip it into his food or drink,

261
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,900
完全无色无味
there shouldn't be any taste or smell,

262
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,590
36小时后  死翘翘
36 hours later, poof.

263
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,920
一个男的  到了这个年纪
A man his age,

264
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,220
又这般卖命工作
working as hard as he does,

265
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,920
没人会感到奇怪
no one will be surprised.

266
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,060
麦克怎么办
What about Mike?

267
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,660
麦克会起疑心
Mike can have his suspicions,

268
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,890
但也只是起疑心而已
but that's all they'll be.

269
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,420
一个一个来
Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.

270
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,420
我不知道什么时候才能再见到古斯
I don't know when I'm gonna see Gus again...

271
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,360
能不能再见到都难说
I mean, if ever.

272
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,160
随身带着
Keep it with you.

273
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,090
一旦有机会
When you have the opportunity,

274
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,860
你就要做好准备
be ready.

275
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,990
他们搜我身怎么办
What if they search me?

276
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,920
他们会吗
Will they do that?

277
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,970
这根放反了
It's the wrong way around.

278
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,590
这是我的幸运香烟
It's my lucky cigarette.

279
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,890
随你便吧  只是别抽这一根
Well, whatever you do, don't smoke it.

280
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,189
你知道他们是有得来速通道的吧
You know they have a drive-thru, right?

281
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,930
不  没关系
Nah, this is good.

282
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,270
要多锻炼  促进血液循环
Could use the exercise. Get he blood pumping.

283
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,830
别担心
Don't worry,

284
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,530
你不用来接我了
you're not gonna have to pick me up.

285
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,960
虽然要费点时间  可我还是能到那里的
It might take me a while, but I'll get there.

286
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,900
天啊  我们俩简直是一对了
Jesus, ain't we a pair?

287
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,970
看来你是真心喜欢吃炸鸡啊
You must really like chicken.

288
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,700
V8引擎  470马力

289
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,330
20英寸轮毂
20-inch rims,

290
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,650
卫星广播  车载蓝牙

百公里加速只要4.7秒
0 to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

292
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,890
哇  你不是在说笑吧
Whoa. What do you mean, on a lark?

293
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,290
突然之间  你爸爸灵光一现
Spur of the moment, your dad just ups and buys you

294
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,100
给你买了一辆全新的道奇挑战者?
a brand-new Challenger?

295
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,630
是啊  我刚开过街角
Yeah, I barely got around the block

296
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,660
我妈就说我们家供不起
and Mom said we couldn't afford it,

297
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,300
于是就把车收回去了
so they took it back.

298
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,310
知道我一共玩了多久吗
Do you know how long I had it?

299
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,930
15小时
Fifteen hours.

300
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,760
好吧  伙计  我跟你说
Well, hey, buddy, let me tell you something.

301
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,700
我在你那个年龄的时候
When I was your age,

302
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,150
要是能让我开那种车
I'd have given my left nut

303
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,230
我愿意割掉左边的蛋  哪怕只有15分钟
to drive a car like that for 15 minutes.

304
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,530
说真的  怎么会有这种事呢
But seriously, how does that happen?

305
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,800
我们当时在看二手车
Well, we were looking at used cars,

306
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,870
我就有点...
and I kind of...

307
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,100
你搞得你家老头内疚了
You guilted him into it.

308
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,500
是啊是啊  我懂了
Yeah, yeah. I know. I hear you.

309
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,430
你又开始谈自己多可怜  还有点小毛病
You pulled the old "Poor little me and my little troubles."

310
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,630
-是不是  -差不多吧
- Am I right? - Maybe.

311
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,560
飞近了太阳  翅膀可是会融化的  小伙子
Yeah, well, you flew too close to the sun, my friend.

312
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,630
要是他给你买的是一辆破车
You'd have let him buy you a clunker

313
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,990
你现在就能开着它了
you'd be driving now,

314
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,700
不用开你妈的老破车了
instead of borrowing Mom's hooptie.

315
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,100
施拉德探员
Agent Schrader.

316
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,000
-你好吗  -很好  多谢关心
- Oh, hey. How you doing? - Well, thank you.

317
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,200
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

318
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,530
小沃尔特  还记得福林先生吗
Walter Junior, do you remember Mr. Fring?

319
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,760
-您好吗  -很高兴再次见到你
- How are you? Well. - Nice to see you again.

320
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,660
你们能光临这里是我们的荣幸

您看起来气色不错

324
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,930
真抱歉
I must apologize.

325
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,360
要是看见您进门
If I had seen you come in,

326
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
绝对不会收您钱的
there would have been no question of accepting your money.

327
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,030
今后  您一定记得要叫我
In the future, please feel free to ask for me.

328
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,409
在我们洛博罗炸鸡馆
A DEA hero should never have

329
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,449
一位缉毒局英雄是绝对应该免费用餐的
to pay for a meal at Pollos Hermanos.

330
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,430
真的吗
No kidding?

331
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,910
你这话我可记下了
I'll take you up on that for sure.

332
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,530
你父母怎样了
And how are your mother and father?

333
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,360
他们很好
They're good.

334
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,700
炸鸡真不错
The chicken is great.

335
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,160
谢谢
Thank you.

336
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,280
要是想做一些零工赚点零花钱
If ever you're interested in rewarding part-time work,

337
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,830
比如放学后打打零工
perhaps something after school?

338
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,870
尽管来找我
My door is always open.

339
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,560
听着不错
Sounds good.

340
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,560
这听着不妙啊
Uh, I don't know about this one.

341
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,330
他可能吃到你们店亏本
He might eat up all your profits.

342
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,480
不打扰您二位用餐了
Well, I'll let you finish your meal.

343
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,100
还要点什么吗
Can I get you anything else?

344
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,500
续杯吗
A refill, perhaps?

345
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,300
不用  我够了
No, thank you. I'm good.

346
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,779
我要  来一杯健怡可乐  谢谢
Sure. Take a Diet Coke. Thank you very much.

347
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,930
没问题
Of course.

348
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,890
我们去哪儿
So where are we going?

349
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,620
今天可有重要任务要干
Oh, big doings today.

350
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,070
今天给你的任务是  睁大眼睛  闭紧嘴巴
The order of the day is eyes open, mouth shut.

351
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,270
你好吗
S'up?

352
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,710
试音  试音
Test, test.

353
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,470
听到吗
You got me?

354
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,510
报数
Count off.

355
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,170
我们走
Let's go.

356
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,270
就这里  请把包装留着
Right here. Leave the wrap on, please.

357
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,870
会做咖啡吗
You know how to make coffee?

358
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,370
当然了
Sure.

359
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,710
去做吧
There you go.

360
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,809
-我简单汇报一下  -请说
- You want a rundown? - Please.

361
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,010
大门处有三个人
Three guys up at the gate--

362
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,960
两个在明处  一个在暗处
two visible, one in the blind.

363
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,910
这里有五个隐蔽起来的后援
We got five guys down here with a backup out of sight.

364
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,640
我让泰鲁斯带着巴雷特狙击步枪
I got Tyrus down in the treeline

365
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,590
埋伏在树丛后面
with a Barret .50.

366
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,820
昨晚就让他潜伏下来
Planted him there last night

367
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,810
防止对手提前打埋伏
in case we had any early arrivals.

368
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,770
我没有多余的枪套了
I don't have an extra holster.

369
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,470
把这个放在你的口袋里  别给人看见
You stick this in your pocket. Keep it out of sight.

370
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,340
如果你今天要呆在这里的话  就得拿把枪
If you're gonna be here today, you're gonna have a gun.

371
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,010
子弹上膛了吗
It's loaded?

372
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,660
我没拔枪的话
I don't want to see that in your hand

373
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,960
你就不要拿枪
unless you see me with mine.

374
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,320
明白了吗
Understood?

375
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,420
只是应急用的
Emergency only.

376
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,790
第一辆车来了
First car is coming.

377
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,240
好  今天你的任务是什么
All right, what's the order of the day?

378
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,280
睁大眼睛  闭紧嘴巴
Eyes open, mouth shut.

379
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,150
好多枪啊
A lot of guns.

380
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,430
没人让你放下武器
Nobody's asking you to give up yours.

381
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,910
你难道想在你们的人来之前把这里扫荡一遍
You want to sweep the place before you bring in your guys?

382
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,380
我就是那个人
I am the guy.

383
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,080
那好吧
All right, then.

384
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,560
欢迎

385
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
和你一起来的人呢

386
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,020
来的只有我而已

387
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,160
为什么

388
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,280
老板相信我能充分捍卫他们的利益

389
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,860
请坐

390
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,400
以下是我提的条件

391
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,660
考虑到我们之前的良好关系

392
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:29,440
我打算一次性付5500万美元

393
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,960
这段恩怨就此了断了

394
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,580
我不会另外付钱  我们从此中断联系

395
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,660
彻底了断

396
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,850
你没有什么回复吗

397
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,690
以下是我的回复

398
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,810
是  还是否

399
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,730
你很清楚我们集团要的是什么

400
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,570
说别的什么都是浪费时间

401
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,080
是  还是否

402
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,700
谈判刚开始就这么僵持

403
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,660
这个问题不容谈判

404
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,900
你那儿是不是还有我的东西
You got something of mine?

405
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,330
放杂物箱里
Glove box.

406
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,930
我想还是要教你怎么开枪
Figure I better teach you how to shoot.

407
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,830
局面可能会很棘手
Could be things are gonna get hairy.

408
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,400
这什么意思
What is this?

409
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,130
你会给我配把枪
You're giving me a gun?

410
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,830
我现在是组织的一员了吗
And now I'm, like, part of the team or whatever?

411
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,030
他说我身上有种特质
He said he sees something in me.

412
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,060
是什么
Like what?

413
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,930
如果简而言之的话
If I had to put it in a word...

414
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,930
我猜想
I'd guess...

415
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,530
是忠诚
loyalty.

416
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,900
忠诚
Loyalty.

417
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,730
是啊
Yeah.

418
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,610
也许只是效忠错了人
Only maybe you got it for the wrong guy.

419
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,200
杰西
Jesse?

420
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,020
好久不见
Long time, no see.

421
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,320
近来好吗
How you doing?

422
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,890
还行
Yeah, you know, uh...

423
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,150
挺好
good.

424
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,050
那就好
Good.

425
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,420
那就好
Good.

426
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,000
我们要开始了
Okay, we're going to get started.

427
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,690
你进来吗
You coming in?

428
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,190
实际上  我们无法改变过去
So the truth is we can't change the past.

429
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,320
事实既定
What's done is done.

430
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,060
我们要为自己的行为负责
We've got to own our actions,

431
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,220
但是给自己量刑定罪
but putting ourselves on trial,

432
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,890
充当自己的法官  陪审团  和行刑员
acting as our own judge, jury, and executioner,

433
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,050
并不是解决之道
it's not the answer

434
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,650
因为很多时候  这种审判
because a lot of the time all that judging does

435
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,020
只会让我们重蹈覆辙
is just ensure that we're going to repeat the cycle.

436
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,190
对吧
Right.

437
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,650
"我真是个混蛋"
"I'm such an asshole."

438
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,200
"没救了"
"It's totally hopeless."

439
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,490
"有何意义"
"What's the point?"

440
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,520
"我想我要再吸一次"
"I think I'll have a hit."

441
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,020
杰西
Jesse.

442
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,320
你的近况如何
What's going on with you these days?

443
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,890
我复吸了
I went back to the crystal.

444
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,350
那你现在清醒么
You sober now?

445
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,750
是啊
Yeah.

446
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,850
四天了  很难得  对吧
Four days. Big whoop, right?

447
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,790
四天也是进步
Four days is four days.

448
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,390
你能来就很好
You're here.

449
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:08,890
你还在洗衣店工作吗
You still... working at the laundry?

450
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,350
那里怎样
How are things there.

451
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,890
逊毙了
Sucks ass.

452
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,650
你想聊聊吗
Anything you want to talk about?

453
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,490
几周前
a couple of weeks back...

454
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,560
我
I, uh...

455
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,920
杀了一条狗
killed a dog.

456
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,150
你的车撞了它么
You hit it with your car?

457
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,620
不是
No, um...

458
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,460
我亲手杀了他
I put him down.

459
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,920
我看着他死去
I watched him go.

460
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,220
我直视他的双眼
I was looking him straight in the eye and...

461
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,190
他不清楚是怎么回事
you know, he didn't know what was happening.

462
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,720
他不知道原因
He didn't know why. He--

463
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,490
他只是害怕  然后
He was just scared, and then...

464
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,590
死了
he was gone.

465
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,250
他活着很煎熬
He was suffering.

466
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,190
替他了结算是种善举
It was a kindness.

467
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,460
不  他没生病
No, he wasn't sick.

468
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,820
不  他只是
No, he was just, like a...

469
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,820
我说不清  就像只
I don't know, like a...

470
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,290
不正常的狗
problem dog.

471
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,250
他做了什么
What did he do?

472
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,490
咬人了吗
Bite someone?

473
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,290
这只狗从不咬人
Uh, this dog never-- never bit anybody.

474
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,820
他是...
He was, uh...

475
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,680
你吸毒了  失去理智
You pick up the rock, you go right to the dark side.

476
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,820
什么都可能发生
Anything can happen.

477
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,190
我不是因为吸了毒
It ain't no rock that made me do it.

478
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,619
那是什么问题
Well, what was the problem?

479
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,450
你为什么非得杀了他
Why did you have to kill him?

480
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,890
请注意交流的语气
Watch the cross-talk, please.

481
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,990
也许细节并不重要
Maybe it's not the details that matter.

482
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,660
对吧
Right?

483
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,350
你对你的行为怎么想  杰西
How'd you feel about what you did, Jesse?

484
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,450
我不知道
I don't know.

485
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,990
谁管你怎么想
Who cares how you feel?

486
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,690
什么样的人  会无缘无故残杀一只狗
What kind of a person kills a dog for no reason?

487
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,020
科琳
Colleen.

488
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,780
你可以登报征养
You put an ad in the paper.

489
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,059
-你可以把他送到收容所  -科琳
- You drop him off at a shelter. - Colleen--

490
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,110
你就是不能端坐在这儿
You just don't sit there

491
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,820
说自己杀了一只无助的
and talk about killing a helpless--

492
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,580
-科琳  -无辜的动物
- Colleen. - ...innocent animal.

493
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,770
我们来这儿不是为了评判别人
We're not here to sit in judgment.

494
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,420
有何不可
Why not?

495
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,910
有何不可  也许她是对的
Why not? Maybe-- Maybe she's right.

496
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,660
也许我该登报
You know, maybe I should have put it in the paper.

497
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,120
也许我当时该做点别的
Maybe I should have done something different.

498
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,920
重点是
The thing is,

499
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,660
如果瞻前顾后  规规矩矩
if you just do stuff and nothing happens...

500
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,690
那还有什么意思
what's it all mean?

501
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
有何意义
What's the point?

502
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,050
这个讨论是关于自我接受
All right, this whole thing is about self-acceptance.

503
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,790
否定自己
Kicking the hell out of yourself

504
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,640
并无益处
doesn't give meaning to anything.

505
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,220
那我就该停止评判
So I should stop judging...

506
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,850
-全盘接受  -这只是开始
- and accept... - It's a start.

507
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,790
无论我做什么
So, no matter what I do,

508
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,388
都该为我欢呼  因为我是个好人吗
hooray for me because I'm a great guy?

509
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:14,320
这样对吗
It's all good?

510
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,510
无论我杀了多少条狗
No matter how many dogs I kill,

511
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:21,320
我就记录一下  然后淡然接受吗
I just what, do an inventory and accept?

512
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,450
你倒车压死了自己的孩子
I mean, you back your truck over your own kid

513
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,520
你就这么接受了吗
and you, like, accept?

514
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,109
这简直是废话
What a load of crap!

515
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,970
杰西  我知道你很痛苦
Hey, Jesse, I know you're in pain.

516
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,950
不  你知道吗
No, y-you know what?

517
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,890
我当初为什么来这儿
Why I'm here in the first place?

518
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,560
是为了向你们贩买冰毒
Is to sell you meth.

519
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,410
你们对我而言  只是顾客
You're nothing to me but customers!

520
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,820
你们中了我的圈套
I made you my bitch.

521
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,220
这你也接受吗
You okay with that?

522
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,560
你接受吗
You accept?

523
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,990
不
No.

524
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,750
我该走了
About time.

525
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,390
杰西  杰西
Jesse. Jesse.

526
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,620
把手电拿过来  好吗
Bring that light over here, will you?

527
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,360
你看见那儿有残渣吗
You see any residue there?

528
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,690
哪儿
Where?

529
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,150
在这儿  底下  就在那儿
Here. On the bottom, right-- right there.

530
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,450
已经一周了
It's been a week.

531
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,010
进展如何
What's going on?

532
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,620
我还没见到他
I haven't seen him.

533
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,959
我想不是
I didn't think so,

534
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,190
不过我会再清洁一遍
but I'll just give it another shot anyway.

535
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,990
伙计
Hey-hey-hey, buddy!

536
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,720
瞧瞧  当上门卫了
Look at that. Graduated to doorman.

537
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,090
终于收到你的来电
Finally found your calling.

538
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,950
瞧那小胡子  玛丽
Ha ha! Ooh! Little whiskers, Marie.

539
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:03,300
怎么了  你给理发师看了狗屁股照
What did you do, show your barber a picture of a dog's ass

540
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,200
然后说"就照这个剪"
and said "I'll take that"?

541
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,670
你还是那么逗  欢迎回来
Charming as usual. Welcome back.

542
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,750
气色不错  玛丽
Looking good, Marie.

543
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,490
谢了  史蒂芬  很高兴见到你
Oh, thanks, Steve. Good to see you.

544
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,890
-你好吗  -他很好
- How you doing? - He's doing fine.

545
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,280
你可以回去了
We, uh, we can take it from here.

546
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,890
-是吧  戈麦斯  -是
- Right, Gomie? - Yeah.

547
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,420
你能挽着他吗
If you want to hold his elbow.

548
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,370
不不不  把你的手拿开
No, no, no, no. You keep your mitts off me.

549
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,170
我没事  我没事
I'm good, I'm good.

550
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,850
祝你好运
Good luck.

551
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,250
走吧  迟到了  快
Let's go. Running late. Come on.

552
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,930
汉克  看着你走进这里
Hank, seeing you walk in here.

553
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,750
我真是无法表达这对我们所有人的意义
I can't tell you what that means to all of us.

554
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,050
你的进步真是惊人
Your progress, it's incredible.

555
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:53,100
是啊  多谢安静的生活和那些维生素片
Yeah, well, chalk it up to clean living and vitamin pills.

556
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,220
史蒂芬告诉你他的好消息了吗
Steve tell you his news?

557
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,690
什么事  终于来月经了吗
What? Finally got your period?

558
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,520
我晋升到14级了
I made GS 14.

不错啊  兄弟
Wow. That's all right, man.

00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,520
史蒂芬说你有线索提供给我们
Steve said you might have something for us.

568
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,300
算是吧
Yeah, maybe.

569
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,220
这得你们说了算
You guys are going to have to tell me.

570
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,920
还记得提姆・罗伯茨吗
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

571
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,620
阿尔布开克警局的探员吗
APD detective?

572
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,850
对  他在调查一宗凶案
Yeah, well, he's working on a murder case,

573
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,260
死者是一个34岁的男性白人
and the victim's a 34-year-old male Caucasian

574
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,620
名叫盖尔・伯蒂彻
by the name of Gale Boetticher.

575
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,150
上个月的一个晚上  伯蒂彻打开门
One night last month, Boetticher opens the door--

576
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,850
脸上就吃了颗子弹
bam, take a bullet to the face

577
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,790
凶手是一个人  也可能好几个
from a person or persons unknown.

578
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,920
盖尔・伯蒂彻绝对是个化学奇才
Now, this Gale Boetticher is a bona fide chemistry genius.

579
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,890
他的学位多的是  是吧
I mean, he's got degrees up the wazoo, right?

580
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,560
而且  你们可能会想  他是个正宗的书呆子
And, uh, as you might expect, he's a nerd's nerd.

581
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,520
素食主义者  不拘小节的那种人
Vegan, sandals and socks kind of guy.

582
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,540
结果是  他还是个头号制毒师
As it turns out, he's also an A-number 1 meth cook.

583
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,550
而引起我注意的
And what caught my eye

584
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:05,320
是  他的特色产品是蓝色冰毒
is, uh, his specialty product's blue.

585
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,490
你怎么看
So what are you thinking?

586
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,120
他就是海森堡
This is your Heisenberg?

587
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,790
不  我觉得他是
No. What I think we got here is, uh, ahem,

588
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,020
海森堡的前任毒师
Heisenberg's former cook

589
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:19,140
也可能是海森堡自己的一个环节
and maybe a line on Heisenberg himself.

590
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,750
不管怎样  你们瞧
Anyway, uh, lo and behold,

591
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,920
在那么多有的没的当中
amidst all the hippie-dippie nonsense, ahem,

592
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,520
我发现了这个
I find this.

593
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,950
这里  我在网上进行了搜索
Now, this here I do a little Google-fu,

594
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,080
然后我发现这是个零件编码
and I-- I realize it's a parts number

595
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,040
是这宝贝特有的
specifically for this baby.

596
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,360
这是个大容量的
Now, that there is a high-volume

597
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,050
高效空气过滤器  工业用空气过滤系统
HEPA industrial air filtration system.

598
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,350
那是个价值三十万的小配件
That's a $300,000 gadget.

599
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,720
非常适合用于制药厂
Be perfect for a pharmaceutical plant

600
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,530
或微芯制造厂
or microchip factory

601
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,350
也可以是边境北部最大的病毒实验室
or maybe the biggest meth lab north of the border.

602
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,460
好吧
Okay.

603
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,140
所以这个小玩意儿
So this little dingus here is manufactured

604
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,120
是一个大型国际公司制造的
by a big international concern--

605
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,390
叫牧歌电气
Madrigal Electromotive.

606
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,730
我致电了他们休斯顿办公室  然后接通了
I call their Houston office, and eventually I get through

607
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,400
他们最热心的20岁的临时工
to the nicest little 20-year-old temp.

608
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,490
我说了点好话
I use some of the Schrader sweet talk on her.

609
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,490
很快  她就给我查资料了
Before you know it, she's pulling files for me.

610
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,850
结果查到六个月前
Turns out six months ago,

611
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,630
这些系统中有一个被运送到
one of these systems was shipped to a depot

612
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,140
阿尔布开克州一个仓库
right here in ABQ.

613
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,250
谁签收的
Who signed for it?

614
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,820
盖尔・伯蒂彻
Gale Boetticher.

615
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,950
于是我就问这位新女朋友  是谁付的钱
So I asked my new girlfriend who paid for it,

616
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,220
她回答"没人"
and she says "Nobody."

617
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,020
他们没有付款人记录
They have no record that anybody actually paid for this thing.

618
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,550
所以我又回去让她多提供点线索  很快
So I go back and push more, and before you know it,

619
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,009
这个临时工走了  也查不到转递地址
uh, the temp's gone, there's no forwarding address,

620
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,230
然后我就和一个蛮横的公司律师说话了
and I'm talking to some snot-nose corporate lawyer

621
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,420
他还要了我的徽章号
who's asking me for my badge number.

622
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,710
此路不通
Brick wall.

623
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,950
所以我查了查牧歌电气
So I take a peek into Madrigal Electromotive.

624
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,950
现在牧歌总部在德国汉诺威
Now, Madrigal is based in Hanover, Germany,

625
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,910
可他们自称是非常多样化的
but they're what they call highly diversified--

626
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,549
涉足工业设备  全球运输
industrial equipment, global shipping,

627
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,680
重大建筑项目
major construction,

628
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,120
还在美国快餐业占有一席之地
and a tiny little foothold in American fast food,

629
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,750
尤其是当地的连锁店
specifically a local chain--

630
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,850
洛博罗炸鸡馆
Pollos Hermanos.

631
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,730
好  那又怎样  对吧  伯蒂彻死了
Okay. So what, right? Boetticher's dead.

632
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,400
我没有他资助人的线索
I got no line on who's been bankrolling him

633
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,020
也不知道他的实验室地址
or where his lab was.

634
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,280
整件事都没个头绪  对吧
The whole thing's a snipe hunt, right?

635
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,580
但现在我有个大胆的想法
But now I get this crazy idea,

636
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,150
而我挥之不去
and I can't shake it.

637
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,930
我整晚盯着天花板
I mean, I-- I stay up nights staring at the ceiling

638
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,180
想理清头绪
and trying to make sense of it.

639
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,420
是那张餐巾纸
It's that napkin.

640
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,080
记得我说过伯蒂彻是素食主义者吧
Remember I told you Boetticher's vegan, right?

641
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,559
我们还讨论过这家伙自己做扁豆面包
I mean, we're talking this guy makes his own fermented lentil bread

642
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,080
管它是什么
or whatever the hell that is.

643
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,850
一个素食主义者去炸鸡店干什么
What's a vegan doing in a fried chicken joint?

644
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,880
或许是去见人
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

645
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,850
谁呢
Like who?

646
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,380
比如...
Well, like maybe...

647
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,050
这个人
this guy.

648
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,750
我们对古斯塔沃・福林了解多少
I mean, what do we know about Gustavo Fring?

649
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,050
这个"执法部门的朋友"
Huh? This whole "Friend of law enforcement" Thing, eh,

650
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,210
可以让你和朋友亲近
could be a case of keep your friends close

651
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,334
可也能拉近与敌人的关系
but your enemies closer.

652
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,610
他花钱负担这次行动
He's got the money to finance this operation.

653
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,020
也许他也脱不了干系
Maybe he's got the connections, too.

654
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,650
也许  只是也许
Maybe, just maybe...

655
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,320
他就是我们要找的人
he's our guy.

656
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,810
汉克  恕我冒犯
Hank, no offense,

657
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,630
可我觉得你有些过头了
but I think you're really reaching.

658
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,950
如果这个人约了人在肯德基
If your guy had his meeting at KFC,

659
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,780
你不会立马想到
you wouldn't immediately assume

660
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,850
他的资助人是肯德基爷爷吧
that he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.

661
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,820
我...
You know, I-- ahem--

662
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,920
我非常同意你们的观点
I couldn't agree more, guys.

663
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:52,680
古斯塔沃・福林  蓝色冰毒
Gustavo Fring, blue meth, you know...

664
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,650
这整件事都太离谱了
The whole thing is off-the-map nuts.

665
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,250
我真该戴上锡纸帽
I ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat, you know?

666
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,680
除非
Except...

667
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,020
我无法用这个小东西包上脑袋
I can't seem to wrap my mind around this one little thing,

668
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,880
这图上是
and that is...

669
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,820
为什么古斯塔沃・福林的指纹
what are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints...

670
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,980
出现在盖尔・伯蒂彻的公寓里
doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment?
