这个计划很大胆啊  怀特先生
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

8
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,045
你确定要这么做吗
You sure this is the way to go?

9
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:19,099
谢了
Gracias.

第三集

16
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,079
他还记得什么
What does he remember?

17
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:07,050
没多少  他来的时候就虚脱且神志不清了
Not a whole lot. He came in dehydrated and disoriented.

18
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,002
给他输液后  他恢复得挺快
But once we gave him fluids he stabilized pretty quickly.

19
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:12,098
但是  我是说  他知道自己在哪儿吗
But, I mean... he knows where he is?

20
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:15,002
是的  当然了
Yes, absolutely.

21
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,040
就是前几天的事想不起来了
It's only the last day or so that seem to be missing.

22
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,043
进去吧  他应该醒了
Go on in, he's probably awake.

23
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:29,002
天啊
My God.

24
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,065
真是对不起
I'm so sorry.

25
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,074
过来这儿
Come here.

26
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,073
你知道我是谁  对吗
You know who I am, right?

27
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:50,085
是的儿子  我认得你  来  抱抱你老爹
Yes, son. I know who you are. Come here, give your old man a hug.

28
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:57,085
见到你们太高兴了
It's so good to see you.

29
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,052
你感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

30
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,041
好些了
Better.

31
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:11,044
我觉得神志清醒了
I feel like myself.

32
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,016
真的  我是指
Really, I mean, in...

33
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,031
前几天的都记不起来了  但是
The last couple days are missing, but...

34
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:21,028
除此之外  感觉还挺好
Other than that, I feel fine.

35
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:23,031
天啊  沃尔特
My God, Walt.

36
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,034
你这都怎么过的呀
What a day this has been?

37
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:31,049
汉克叔叔  他跟人发生了枪战
So, Uncle Hank, he was in a shoot-out.

38
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:33,021
枪战
A shoot-out?

39
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:36,035
他杀了个什么人  大毒枭之类的
He killed some guy. Some big drug dealer.

40
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:39,042
-汉克叔叔把他干掉了  -天  他没事吧
- Uncle Hank wasted him. - My God. Is he all right?

41
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:42,003
-当然没事了  -在哪发生的
- Absolutely fine. - But where did this happen?

42
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:44,079
-他怎么会...  -沃尔特  一切都好
- How could he be... - Walt, everything's okay.

43
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:47,056
我们都没事
We're all okay.

44
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:53,021
还不清楚是什么引发的吗
And no idea what caused it?

45
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:57,075
不过他们打算做一整套检查  所以
But they're gonna run a whole series of tests, so...

46
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,082
但到底会怎样呢
But what could it be?

47
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:01,024
他们有没有说最坏的情况会怎样
Did they give you a worst-case scenario?

48
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:08,059
我真的觉得  没必要提前想这么多
I really...there's no point in getting ahead of ourselves, so...

49
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,064
在哪个超市
Which supermarket?

50
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:13,087
是那种大型超市  还是连锁店
Is it, like, a big one?  Like, a chain?

51
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:14,080
玛丽
Marie.

52
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,089
别误会
Don't get me wrong.

53
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,050
我觉得这是好事
I think it's just great that

54
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,020
他总算回来了  病情也有所好转
he's back and he's feeling better.

55
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,012
我只是  我是说
I just, I mean...

56
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:27,087
他  一丝不挂
He... naked?

57
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,024
他真的
He was...

58
00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:31,002
一丝不挂
naked...

59
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:32,023
一丝不挂啊
naked.

60
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,065
还是在超市里
In a supermarket.

61
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,028
不会是全食超市吧[高档杂货零售商]
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

62
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,017
不管怎么样  我都要尽快赶去你那边
In any case, I'm gonna get over there as soon as I can.

63
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:42,033
玛丽  现在先别担心这个
Don't worry about it right now, Marie.

64
00:06:43,024 --> 00:06:44,059
汉克怎么样
How's Hank?

65
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:46,054
我赶过来才见到他不过三十秒
I ran over here and I get to see him all

66
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:50,057
他就被带走了
Of 30 seconds before they yanked him away.

67
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:53,026
就只希望...就今天一天
You'd think... today of all days,

68
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,065
他们会让他准时下班回家
They'd let him go home on time.

69
00:06:58,065 --> 00:06:59,056
但是他怎么样
But how is he?

70
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,060
到底怎么样
Really?

71
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,015
他可是坚不可摧的  你知道的
He's indestructible, you know that.

72
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:12,064
我亮明身份  然后告诉嫌犯
I identified myself and told the suspect

73
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,085
举起手来  转身面对我
to show his hands, turn and face me.

74
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:18,034
这时我认出嫌犯是塞拉曼加先生
At this point, I identified the suspect as Mr. Salamanca

75
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:21,063
并且发现他腹部有一处枪伤
and observed what appeared to be a gunshot wound in his midsection.

76
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,079
他在你到达之前就中枪了吗
He was shot previous to your arrival?

77
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,095
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

78
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:28,055
我再一次要求他举起手来
Again I instructed him to show his hands.

79
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,089
塞拉曼加先生朝车子冲了过去
Mr. Salamanca lunged toward the vehicle

80
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:35,033
接着就向我开火  我确认武器是M16突击步枪
And fired on me with what I ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

81
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:40,023
我还击并寻找掩护  塞拉曼加先生不断向我扫射
I returned fire and sought cover as Mr. Salamanca proceed to engage me.

82
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:44,022
当他停下装填弹药时
When he paused to reload...

83
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,046
我趁机将他一击毙命
I was able to take an effective shot.

84
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,019
施拉德探员
Agent Schrader.

85
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,004
你为何会在没有增援的情况下
What were you doing in a shooting fight

86
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:54,080
一个人参与枪战呢
On your own, with no backup?

87
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,081
塞拉曼加先生的出现很出乎我的意料
Mr.Salamanca's presence was not something I'd anticipated.

88
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,040
-我此行原是处理别的事  -什么别的事
- I was tending to another matter. - What other matter?

89
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,042
是桩不相干的家务事
An unrelated family matter.

90
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:09,086
据我所知  是为了找你姐夫
Searching for your brother-in-law as I understand.

91
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,074
-你姐夫  -是的  长官
- Your brother-in-law?  - Yes, sir.

92
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,012
他后来已被找到了  他没事
He's since been found. He's fine.

93
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,097
整件事完全是一场误会
The whole thing was a misunderstanding.

94
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:18,094
但当时他失踪好几个小时了
But at the time, he'd been missing for several hours and,

95
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:22,007
因为他病得很重  全家都很焦急
since he's in poor health, the whole family was concerned.

96
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,052
我去找了他的朋友和熟人谈话
I was talking to his friends and acquaintances

97
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:26,033
想查清楚他的下落
Trying to get a fix on his whereabouts.

98
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,084
现场的蒙特卡洛车是他之前一个学生的
The Monte Carlo at the scene belonged to a former student of his, a...

99
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,011
他叫杰西·平克曼
Jesse Pinkman.

100
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,094
我在追踪平克曼先生的车
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car

101
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:38,082
正好遇上了塞拉曼加先生
When I came across Mr. Salamanca.

102
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,054
这个平克曼又是怎么回事
And what about this Pinkman?

103
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:43,058
他的车为什么在犯罪现场  查过他的底了吗
What was his car doing at the crime scene?Have you run him down yet?

104
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:45,036
还没  但我们正在着手调查
Not yet, but we're working on it.

105
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:01,078
伙计  他们就像耶和华见证人[一种宗教信仰]  不会放弃的
Man, they're like Jehovah's witnesses.They don't give up.

106
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:05,034
我搞不懂  他们为什么不直接把门踹开
I don't get it. Why don't they just kick your door down?

107
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:08,029
-他们需要正当理由  -"正当理由"
- They need probable cause.  - "Probable cause?"

108
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:10,091
喂  你做什么了  抢银行了吗
Yo, what'd you do?  Rob a bank?

109
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,096
我告诉过你  这事很他妈严重
I told you, this is serious shit.

110
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,069
-我就像个逃犯一样  -好吧
- I'm like an outlaw. - Ok

111
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,078
开工吧
Let's do this.

112
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,009
我的老天
Holy christ!

113
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,049
你简直是威利·旺卡[《查理与巧克力工厂》中主角]
You're Willy Wonka!

114
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,021
你就是威利·旺卡  而我拿到了金券
You are Willy Wonka, and I got the golden ticket!

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,072
快让我登上你的魔法船  伙计
Put me on your magical boat, man!

116
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,085
让我在冰毒的河流里畅游吧
Sail me down your chocolatey river of meth!

117
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:55,014
[此段对话模仿电影《查理与巧克力工厂》]

118
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,067
你把伪麻黄素放哪儿了
So, where you keep the pseudo?

119
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:59,001
我们用苯丙酮法制毒  看见那个桶了吗
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?

120
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:02,052
那是甲胺水溶液  有那个就不用伪麻黄素了
Aqueous Methylamine. With that, you don't need pseudo.

121
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:04,021
拜托  来帮下我  伙计
Come on, help me out, man!

122
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,001
不用伪麻黄素
No pseudo?

123
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,014
过来我这  小可爱
Come to me, beautiful baby.

124
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:09,090
我会好生待你的
I'm gonna be so good to you.

125
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,072
拿着这个  给你
Just take this, here.

126
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:17,092
我不能就这么让你毁了这地方
But I can't just let you break this down.

127
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,092
那可是亵渎
That'd be sacrilege!

128
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,047
我告诉过你  这就是为什么我们来这
I told you, that's why we're here.

129
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,067
-你看见那些条子了吧  -当然
- You saw the cops! All right?  - Sure.

130
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:26,079
我们不能赶制一批货么
But couldn't we just cook one quick batch?

131
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,083
-路上用的  -不行  别想了行不
- For the road?  - No, forget it, all right?

132
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,078
得处理掉这些东西  就是现在
This stuff has to go, like, now.

133
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,045
这是你欠我的
You owe me!

134
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:35,069
我们目前交情是还行
We're cool and all, but

135
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,078
但我不会忘记你曾那么对我的
I ain't forgetting you just left me stranded.

136
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,027
天  猴子
God, Badger!

137
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:43,054
别给我添乱
Don't mess with me!

138
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,034
懂了没
Got it?

139
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,045
懂了
Yeah, I got it.

140
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,055
我的天
My God.

141
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,058
行了  就这些
Okay, that's all of it.

142
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:20,003
这是个糟糕的选择
This is a bad choice.

143
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:27,008
你确定这家伙没问题吗
You sure about this guy?

144
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,078
他可是相当  相当棒
He's totally, totally cool.

145
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:31,026
他是我表兄
He's my cousin.

146
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:39,055
-喂  我们说好了吧  500块  -那可不行  得1000块
- Yo, what'd we say, 500?  - We didn't say, and it's 1,000.

147
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:40,095
1000块
$1,000?

148
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:43,004
拜托  你往哪拖啊  西雅图吗
C'mon, where you towing it, man, Seattle?

149
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,006
跟距离没关系  是货的问题
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

150
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:50,087
伙计  我身上总共只有
Dude, all I got on me is...

151
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:56,088
560块
$560.

152
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,093
这样的话
You know what?

153
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,048
克洛维斯  他晚点会付清余额的
Clovis! He'll pay you the rest later.

154
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:05,028
他不会食言的  杰西是个正直的人
He's totally good for it! Jesse's a stand-up dude.

155
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,032
是吗  你是"正直的人"吗
That right? You a "stand-up dude"?

156
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,050
是啊  我是
Yeah, I am.

157
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,046
我会付你另外500块的
I will get you the other $500.

158
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,017
还要给500块
$500 more.

159
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:16,087
说话算话吧
Your word's bond, right?

160
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,026
对
Right.

161
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:29,027
我可救了场啊  我可替你担保了
I saved your skinny ass, yo. I totally vouched for you.

162
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:32,064
你现在到底在做什么
What are you doing now, exactly?

163
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:35,035
我会给你争取大概两个小时
I'm giving you, like, two hours

164
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:39,003
然后我会用公用电话告发你  而不是手机
and then I'm calling on a pay phone, not a cell phone.

165
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,067
你可不能用自己的真名
You're not using your own name.

166
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:45,002
当然  我会按你说的做  但是
I mean,obviously.Look,dude,I'll do,like, what you said,but

167
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,082
为什么  你这么做到底想干什么
Why? Why do you gotta go and do this?

168
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,042
他们需要正当理由
They need probable cause.

169
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,025
我就给他们一个
I'm giving it to them.

170
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:06,097
你记得的最后一件事是什么
What's the last thing you remember?

171
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:14,002
我正开车回家  我想是的
I was driving home...I think.

172
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,037
你还记得怎么进的家门吗
Do you remember coming home?

173
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:22,068
你进门来  我问你为什么上气不接下气
You came in, and I asked why you were out of breath?

174
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:28,070
你不记得我在泡澡时  你跟我说过话吗
You don't remember talking to me when I was in the bathtub?

175
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:32,038
抱歉  我不记得了
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

176
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:34,092
没别的了吗  没有一闪而过的画面吗
Nothing else? No fleeting images?

177
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,075
不知道
I don't know.

178
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:46,037
我当时正沿着马路或高速路走
I was walking down some road or highway...

179
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,088
很多车灯照过来
With a lot of headlights,

180
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:53,099
我记得我很害怕
And I remember feeling fear.

181
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,030
谢谢
Thank you.

182
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,029
当然  这里有些有好消息
There's definitely some good news here.

183
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:04,085
核磁共振扫描没发现转移瘤
The MRI shows no metastases.

184
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:07,057
就是说癌细胞没有扩散到大脑吗
Meaning the cancer hasn't spread to the brain?

185
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:09,059
是的  情况还不错
Yeah, we're looking really good.

186
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:11,064
感谢上帝
Thank God.

187
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:15,095
那到底是怎么回事呢
So, what was it, then?

188
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:18,014
没有中风或者癫痫发作的迹象
Well, there's no sign of stroke or seizure.

189
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:20,083
考虑到你的状况  血液检查也没什么问题
And considering your condition, the blood panel looks good.

190
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,076
那这到底是什么情况
Then what are we talking about?

191
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,055
怎么回事
What happened?

192
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:29,037
就目前来看  我们实在...下不了定论
As of right now, we really...can't say.

193
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,030
抱歉  虽然我不太了解这方面
Forgive me. Granted, this is not my field,

194
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,053
但是这会不会跟我服用的
But isn't it possible that this had something to do

195
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:38,034
那些治疗的药物有关呢
with all the prescriptions I've been taking?

196
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:40,075
有止吐药
There's the antiemetic,

197
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,044
有止咳药
the antitussive,

198
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:43,079
又是这又是那
the this, the that,

199
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,005
更别说化疗本身了
not to mention the Chemo itself.

200
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:51,000
过去几天中断治疗  没吃这些药
And being off all of them for the past few days,

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,077
我必须承认  我感觉
I have to say, I'm feeling...

202
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:55,002
好多了
much better.

203
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:57,050
还有  我们去拿药的时候
And when we pick up these medications,

204
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,018
说明书就像胳膊一样长
the information sheets are as long as your arm.

205
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:04,077
我是说  一页页都写的副作用和警告什么的
I mean, it's page after page of side effects and... and warnings.

206
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:07,044
对  的确  会不会就是这么简单
Right, exactly. Could it be that simple?

207
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:10,074
当然  我们会多加注意的
We'll take another look at that, sure.

208
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,090
沃尔特  我理解你最近一直比较压抑
Walt, I understand that you've been kind of stressed out lately.

209
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,027
-压抑吗  我不觉得我  -沃尔特  拜托
- Stressed out?  No, I don't think I'm...  - Walt, please.

210
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:23,009
说"压抑"已经算客气的了
"Stressed out" is putting it...mildly.

211
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:29,096
我最近可能是有点多虑了
I guess I've had a lot on my mind lately,

212
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,094
但我说了  我感觉好多了
but as I've said, I'm feeling much better.

213
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:35,073
我们是不是该讨论下我何时能出院
Shouldn't we be talking about when I can get out of here?

214
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:38,044
现在还为时尚早
That may still be a ways down the road.

215
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,092
"为时尚早"
"A ways down the road?"

216
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:46,010
我觉得下一步应该安排一个精神评估
Actually, I think our next move is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

217
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:51,052
真有这个必要吗
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

218
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:53,085
没人喜欢老呆在医院里  我理解
Nobody likes being in the hospital. I get that.

219
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:56,043
但是我们必须搞清楚这次意外的起因
But until we know what caused this incident

220
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:58,031
我们不确定它还会不会复发
we can't be certain it won't recur.

221
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,080
[汽车旅馆  欢迎光临  内设全频道有线电视
24小时营业  宾至如归  服务友好]

222
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,003
最后一口吗
That your last hit?

223
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:47,048
动作快点
Finish it quick.

224
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:24,051
趴下
Get on your stomach now!

225
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:26,046
翻身  动作快点
Get over, roll. Do it now!

226
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:35,046
我在走  我在走
I'm going, I'm going.

227
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:38,061
怎么了  我做了什么
What's going on? What'd I do?

228
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,034
我猜你就是杰西·平克曼
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

229
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:07,093
-怎么  老兄  -再说一遍
- What, man?  - Tell me again.

230
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,017
再一遍吗
Again?

231
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:13,042
有什么说的  我跟她就是开派对  仅此而已
What's there to tell, okay?Her and I were partying,that's it.

232
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:16,061
从周六晚上开始是吧  连开三天啊
Since Saturday night? Partying for three days straight.

233
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:20,011
就只玩女人  吸从你兄弟屠库那里搞到的冰毒
Just bumping uglies and smoking that crystal you got from your pal Tuco?

234
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,075
塔库  我不认识什么塔库
Taco?  I don't know any Taco.

235
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:24,039
我他妈肯定我没吸过什么冰毒
And I damn sure didn't say anything about no crystal.

236
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,093
-三天  你肯定会饿的吧  -对啊
- Three days, you must have got hungry.  - Yeah, I guess.

237
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:29,013
你们叫过外卖吗
You order take-out?

238
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:31,069
-叫过  -从哪叫的
- Yeah. - Where from?

239
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:35,037
你们是从角落墙缝里
You get yourself a little of that Moo goo gai pan

240
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:37,005
叫了一点那什么蘑菇鸡片对吧
from that chink place around the corner?

241
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:41,044
不  没有  我们从自动售货机里买东西
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff from the vending machine.

242
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:45,004

244

你没注意到你的车丢了吗

245
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:52,030
没  直到你们撞开门进屋
No, not until you guys went and busted down the door.

246
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,013
谁来赔那门的钱啊
Now who's gonna pay for that?

247
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:56,072
管理员肯定要不会放过我的
Management's gonna be on my ass for sure.

248
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:59,094
-为什么你不接手机  -手机在我车里
- Why didn't you answer your cell phone?  - It was in my car.

249
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:02,073
-真的吗  -是的
- That right?  - Yeah.

250

256

00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:09,067
还好屠库已经死翘翘了
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

272
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:12,036
要是我丢了这么一笔钱  我会去自杀
I lost this kind of money, I'd wanna kill myself.

273
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,049
你头头是谁  小杂种
So, who's your chief, li'l injun?

274
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,018
什么
What?

275
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:20,061
-什么意思  -你讲的全是屁话
- What does that even mean? - I think your story's bullshit.

276
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:23,019
我认为你认识屠库·塞拉曼加
I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was.

277
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,096
我认为你的车停在那说明你也在那儿
I think your car was there 'cause you were there.

278
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,077
我赶到的时候屠库中了弹
Tuco had a bullet in him when I got there,

279
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:29,022
我认为这跟你脱不了干系
And I think you know something about that, too.

280
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:32,033
你这话什么意思
So, what are you saying?

281
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,059
说我杀人了吗
I shot someone?

282
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:36,092
用什么  枪吗
With, like, a gun?

283
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,049
你
You?

284
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:43,069
你只有本事往面巾纸里打手枪吧[隐晦意]
Now, Only shooting you do is into a kleenex.

285
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:47,049
但我想你知道是谁干的
But I think you know the badass who did.

286
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:52,049
听着  我一直在跟温蒂开派对
Look, I was partying with Wendy.

287
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:56,011
芳韵和嘿咻
Funyuns and boom-boom.

288
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:58,050
不
No.

289
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:00,059
我可不这么想
I don't think so.

290
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:04,056
跟你这么说吧  我们打算
Tell you what, we're gonna,

291
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:08,064
跟你那位瘦小火辣的女友谈谈
go talk to that skinny, yeast factory of a girlfriend you got.

292
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,071
你知道吗
And you know what?

293
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:15,086
我有种感觉  她会把你卖了
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know, roll on you.

294
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:21,013
你给我老实呆着
Don't go nowhere.

295
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,084
我的根汁汽水呢  快点儿啊
Where's my root beer? Come on!

296
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:40,000
我要撒尿  我血糖低
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

297
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,086
-我生病了  -生病
- I got medical issues. - Medical issues?

298
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:47,008
什么病  是你男人满足不了你
Like what kind of medical issues? You got penis withdrawal?

299
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:49,017
还是办事的时候被人打断了
You got "Schlongus interruptus"?

300
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,021
听着  温蒂  你老实交代
Wendy, listen, talk to me,

301
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:55,019
我就给你根汁汽水  让你去厕所
And you get a root beer and a tinkle.

302
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,062
-说说这三天的事  -我说过了
- Now tell me the last three days. - I told you,

303
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:59,060
我们从周六就一直混在一起
We were shacked up since Saturday.

304
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:03,062
你俩都没离开过房间  一分钟也没有
Neither of you left the room? Not even for a little, little minute?

305
00:22:04,014 --> 00:22:06,018
一秒钟也没有吗
Not even for a second?

306
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:11,047
一秒钟  我不确定  可能吧
For a second? I dunno, maybe.

307
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,049
可能
Maybe?

308
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:14,063
杰西有没有离开过房间
Did Jesse leave the room?

309
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:17,088
他有  是不是
He did, didn't he?

310
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:22,012
温蒂  说吧  说吧  温蒂
Wendy, you can do it. You can do it, Wendy.

311
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,092
我知道你想回去透透风  温蒂
You know you wanna go back to giving windys, Wendy.

312
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,026
是你  我认识你
It's you. I know you.

313
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,090
你就是黑色卡车里那个人
You're the one in the black truck.

314
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,075
你让我跟那孩子上床
You wanted me to do that kid.

315
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,097
-什么  -那个拄拐杖的孩子
- What? - The kid with the crutches.

316
00:22:38,097 --> 00:22:41,025
-穿球衣的孩子  -别岔开话题
- The football player. - How about we stay on topic?

317
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:45,076
听好了  杰西星期六晚上11点过来的
Look, Jesse came over to the palace at eleven o'clock Saturday night.

318
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:48,063
我们一直在一起  他一直没离开房间
We were together the whole time, and he never left the room.

319
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:51,011
我要说的就这些
And that's all I'm saying about that.

320
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:53,092
行了  我的根汁汽水呢
Now, come on. Where's my root beer?

321
00:22:58,006 --> 00:23:00,071
你让她跟那个穿球衣的孩子上床  你个变态
You wanted her to bang a football player, you big ball pervert?

322
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:02,010
这事说来话长  格米
It's a long story, Gomie.

323
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,084
那是当然的  我要你讲给我听
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,

324
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:05,070
但我们得先放了平克曼
But first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

325
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,018
还不行  我要最后审一下那小混蛋
Not yet. I got one more shot at that little skid mark.

326
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,038
你睡眠怎么样
And how are you sleeping?

327
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:23,077
很好  大部分晚上都是
Fine. Most nights.

328
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,078
不错
Good.

329
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:28,027
你脑子里是否有经常重现的想法或图像
Have you noticed any recurring thoughts or images,

330
00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:30,007
让你挥之不去的念头呢
Things you can't get out of your head?

331
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:38,059
有没有内疚或者受迫的感觉
How about feelings of guilt or persecution?

332
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,026
没有  医生  听我说
No, look, Doctor.

333
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,023
我不想冒犯
I don't mean to be rude,

334
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:45,014
可我们这是在干嘛
But where is this going, exactly?

335
00:23:45,071 --> 00:23:48,082
我们在开始治疗  沃特  正在进行治疗
We're starting a process, Walt, an ongoing process.

336
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:50,082
你喜欢我叫你沃特还是沃尔特
Do you prefer Walt or Walter?

337
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:52,053
需要进行多久
Ongoing for how long?

338
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,074
我们才刚刚见面  这很难说
I just met you, it's hard to say.

339
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:57,033
有可能是几天  几周  或几个月
We could be talking about days, weeks, months.

340
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:02,091
听我说  医生  我真的没事了
Look, Doctor, I feel fine, really.

341
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:06,092
而且  如果真的有必要治疗
Now, if this is truly necessary,

342
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:09,076
我不能出院接受治疗吗
Can't I continue as an outpatient?

343
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:15,090
神游状态是非常严重的事件
A fugue state is a very serious event.

344
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:18,090
如果你驾车的时候发病怎么办
What if you were to disassociate while driving?

345
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,037
如果你使自己陷入险境被警察枪击怎么办
What if you were to get into a situation where you could be shot by the police?

346
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:25,031
你明白  我们不能让你出院
You understand, we can't allow you to leave until we're certain

347
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,070
除非确定你的症状非复发性的
What happenedwas a non-recurring event.

348
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,089
单凭你说自己没事是不解决问题的
Saying you feel fine doesn't solve this.

349
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:39,060
能跟我讲讲医患保密协议吗
Would you tell me about patient confidentiality?

350
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,007
你很直接
It's very straightforward.

351
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,005
未经你同意
Without your permission,

352
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:44,040
我不得向任何人透露你我谈话内容
I can't disclose anything you tell me to anyone.

353
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,093
我的亲属呢
What about my family?

354
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:48,041
亲属  警方  任何人都不可以
Not your family, not to the police. Not to anyone.

355
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,040
除非你威胁要杀死某人
The only exception would be if you threatened to kill someone.

356
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,048
那样我可以告诉被威胁者  也仅限被威胁者
Then I'd be able to tell that person, but only that person.

357
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,090
而你作为一名执业医生
And you, as a medical practioner,

358
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,003
完全受此条款约束
You abide by these strictures absolutely.

359
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,020
好吧
All right.

360
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:15,091
我根本没失忆
There was no fugue state.

361
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:19,053
我什么都记得
I remember everything.

362
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,023
真相是
The truth is,

363
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:29,096
我无法忍受在那间房子里多待一秒
I couldn't stand to spend another second in that house.

364
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,060
我只是想离开
I just had to get out.

365
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:36,020
所以我就离开了
And so I left.

366
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,044
我想都没想  只是做了
I didn't think about it. I just did it.

367
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:41,047
我走了很长时间
I walked for a long time,

368
00:25:41,047 --> 00:25:44,012
走到走不动的时候  就搭便车
And when I couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

369
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,044
我去了盖洛普市
I got as far as Gallup, and...

370
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:55,046
然后觉得该回家了
Then it was just time to come home.

371
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:56,057
这么说
So,

372
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:00,018
全裸着在超市里被人发现
Being found naked in a supermarket,

373
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,047
只是你让谎言顺利通过的办法
That was your way of giving credibility to a lie?

374
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:06,076
这样他们就不会问你为何失踪了
Of avoiding questions about your disappearance?

375
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:16,014
为什么离家出走
Why run away?

376
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,031
你想要逃离什么
What did you feel you had to run from?

377
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:28,017
医生  我妻子怀孕7个月了
Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant

378
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:30,029
而我们原本没打算再要孩子的
With a baby we didn't intend.

379
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:34,029
我15岁的儿子患有脑瘫
My 15-year-old son has cerebral palsy.

380
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,054
我只是个资历很高的高中化学教员
I am an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher.

381
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:44,052
能上班的时候  年薪也就4万3千7百块
When I can work, I make $43,700 per year.

382
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:47,049
我眼睁睁地看着自己的同事和朋友
I have watched all of my colleagues and friends

383
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:51,025
一个个都混得比我好  而再过18个月
Surpass me in every way imaginable, and within 18 months,

384
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:52,072
我就要死了
I will be dead.

385
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,023
你还问我为什么出走
And you ask why I ran?

386
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:33,069
格米  劳驾来问问他
Gomie, you wanna do the honors?

387
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:45,001
-什么意思  -意思是"是"
- What's that mean? - That means "yes."

388
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:46,062
按铃是"是"  不按铃是"否"
"Yes" is a bell, "no" is no bell.

389
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:49,005
得了吧  这真是扯淡
Come on, this is bullshit!

390
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,033
你看看他
Look at this dude.

391
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:52,065
他连自己在哪个星球上都不知道
He doesn't even know what planet he's living on.

392
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,017
迪奥
Tio,

393
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:57,020
我们是在火星上吗
Are we on the planet Mars?

394
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:02,077
我们是在土星上吗
Are we on the planet Saturn?

395
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:06,068
我们是在地球上吗
Are we on the planet Earth?

396
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,084
迪奥  今天是星期五吗
Tio, is today Friday?

397
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:14,032
今天是星期一吗
Is today Monday?

398
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,096
今天是星期二吗
Is today Tuesday?

399
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,051
看来他清楚得很呢  开始吧
Seems like he's all there. Let's go for it.

400
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:27,044
这个人昨天去过你家吗
Was this man at your house yesterday?

401
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,055
这个人昨天去过你家吗
Was this man at your house yesterday?

402
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,016
这边这个人  他去过你家  是不是
This guy right here, he was at your house, right?

403
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:53,035
他是不是跟你外甥屠库有交易
Was he doing business with your nephew Tuco?

404
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,072
你害怕这个人吗
Are you scared of this man?

405
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:02,077
不  他不害怕
Nah, he's not scared.

406
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,085
说呀  老爷子
Come on, granddad.

407
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:11,024
你不想帮忙吗
Don't you want to help us out?

408
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,068
老天
Oh, man.

409
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,027
看来他是不想
I guess that's a no.

410
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,065
我早跟你说了  他是个老黑帮
I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.

411
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:47,067
在圣昆丁关了17年都没开过口
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years in San Quentin.

412
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:48,072
不管得没得中风
Stroke or no stroke,

413
00:29:48,072 --> 00:29:50,090
老派墨西哥黑帮就不跟警察合作
Old school gangbang Mexicans don't help the Feds.

414
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,003
已经完事了  至少值得一试
All right already. It was worth a try at least.

415
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:54,045
我们得放了平克曼
We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

416
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,035
没事的  他也不是什么大人物
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

417
00:29:57,035 --> 00:29:59,055
你是说你相信他编的那个残疾故事
What, you telling me you buy that lame-ass story of his?

418
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:03,015
我宁愿相信那个残疾故事
I buy that lame-ass story more than I buy he had anything to do

419
00:30:03,015 --> 00:30:04,058
也不信他能跟枪杀屠库扯上关系
With shooting Tuco, man.

420
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,035
爸  你好 老爸
Dad? Hey, Dad.

421
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:10,097
能听见吗
Can you hear me?

422
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,014
我很好  我
I'm fine. I'm, uh...

423
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:19,010
什么  她打电话了
What's... She did?

424
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,068
我没收到留言
No, I didn't get any messages.

425
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:24,023
是这么回事  我电话丢了
You know, actually I lost my phone,

426
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,096
太忙了没时间买新的
And I've been too busy to get a new one.

427
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:29,025
我忙得跟什么似的  都是正事
I've been busy as sh... Totally productive.

428
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:32,043
知道吗  我马上就有工作了
Hey, you know what? I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

429
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,000
数据输入  我们谈起过的
Data entry, like we talked about.

430
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:39,038
我非常高兴
I'm totally amped.

431
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:42,006
你能来接我一下吗
Could you give me a ride?

432
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,091
我现在在城里  我的车...
I'm actually, I'm downtown and my car's in the...

433
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,037
没事  没关系的
No, that's cool.

434
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:54,089
等你有时间我再打电话
I will call you later when you have some...

435
00:30:57,096 --> 00:31:00,040
我懂  我懂
I get it. I get it.

436
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:14,022
谢谢
Thanks.

437
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:16,097
你现在去哪儿
So, what are you doing now?

438
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:19,012
华夫松饼店

439
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,031
华夫松饼店不错
Waffle House is good.

440
00:31:58,007 --> 00:31:59,012
是公用电话
Pay phone?

441
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:01,086
是公用电话  地方隐蔽没人跟踪
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere, nobody followed.

442
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,040
你怎么样
How'd it go?

443
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,064
很好  你呢
Okay. You?

444
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:08,078
他们把我整得够呛

谁抓的你
So, who came for you?

448
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:17,097
禁毒署吗  他们问你什么了
The DEA? What did they ask you?

449
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:21,055
问题就在这  知道吗  你那个浑球连襟
That's the thing, you know. Your scumbag brother-in-law

450
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:23,015
拿走了我的应急基金
Took my rainy day fund.

451

你的什么  什么意思
Your what? What is that?

452

My rainy day fund, $68,000, okay?

453
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,078
狗娘养的混蛋  还当我面笑那么开心
Cueball son of a bitch laughed in my face.

Now I got like $80 to my name.

455
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:36,029

Wait, wait. What does he know? Does he know it's your money?

456
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:38,092
他  他知道个屁
No, man, he doesn't know shit, okay?

457
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:40,009
计划成功了
The plan worked.

458
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:42,005
他们信了
They bought it.

459
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:44,072
可我还有账单要付呢  伙计  我完蛋了
I've got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

461
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,035
没有  多谢关心

猴子的表兄把它拖到自家车库了  不用担心
Badger's cousin took it to his garage. It's safe.

465
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:02,029
他能把车修好吗
Can he get it running again?

466
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,014
修它干嘛
Why?

467
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:06,071
我们继续制毒
So we can cook.

468
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:09,055
你还想继续制毒
So you still wanna cook?

469
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:11,028
说真的
Seriously?

470
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:14,080
有什么不同  杰西
What's changed, Jesse?

没有  我没睡
No, I was awake.

477
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,000
要玉米片吗
Want some cornflakes?

478
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,092
要
Sure.

479
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:26,096
你还好吧
You okay?

480
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,050
西南面那家苯胺厂  又在看
Southwest Aniline? Again?

481
00:38:33,014 --> 00:38:34,009
这是什么
What's this?

482
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:36,053
这是我们在你老乡那儿发现的蓝色冰毒
It's the blue meth we found up by your late homie.

483
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:40,019
屠库要是我老乡  查尔斯·曼森[变态杀人狂]就是你的
Tuco wasn't my homie, anymore than Charlie Manson was yours.

484
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:43,040
实验室说这是用苯丙酮法制的
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

485
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,085
苯丙酮法
P2P, huh?

486
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,020
你怎么想
So what are you thinking?

487
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,032
是这两个傻贼制的吗
The two stooges over here cooked it?

488
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,059
实验室说这是他们见过的最纯的冰毒
Lab said that blue meth's the purest they've seen.

489
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:54,097
至少是  自这个之后
At least since this.

490
00:38:55,061 --> 00:39:01,049
-疯狂小八  -疯狂小八  屠库
- Krazy-8  - Krazy-8...Tuco

491
00:39:02,077 --> 00:39:05,049
这些事件都有某种联系
Somehow, some way, it's all connected.

492
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:09,032
或许有个很简单的解释
A simple explanation...

493
00:39:09,032 --> 00:39:12,017
只是我想不出来  想得我头疼了
Only I'm not seeing it. And it's making my head hurt.

494
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,070
那是因为你研究这破冰毒太上心了
That's 'cause you're working that ugly melon too hard.

495
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,001
闷死了  我们喝啤酒去
It's dead around here. Let's go get a couple of beers.

498
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:23,027
你请客  见鬼了  难道是过五月节
You're buying? Holy crap. What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?

499
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,052

谢谢  伙计  谢谢你
Thanks, man. Thank you.

This is from all of us.

509
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:58,059
你们不该破费的
You shouldn't have.

510
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:03,059
你们这帮恶心鬼
You sick, sick puppies.

511
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,094
我爱死它了
I love it!

512
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,018

不喝了  谢谢  你拿走吧
No thanks, buddy. You take it.

514
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,090
你应该喝了它
You're supposed to drink it.

515
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:22,014
护士说你得多喝水
The nurse said you have to stay hydrated.

516
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:24,074
我不渴
But I'm not thirsty.

517
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:27,071
爸  喝了它
Dad. Drink it.

518
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,078
迟到总比不到好  是吧
Better late than never, huh?

519
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:48,018
怎么样了  老兄  你还好吗
How you doing, buddy? You all right?

520
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:50,030
我看到某人来过的标志了哈
I see the Mark of the Beast there, huh?

521
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,094
玛丽早上来过  它们给这地方添了许多生气
Marie stopped by this morning. They really cheer the place up.

522

I ran into Sky downstairs.

523

They're rounding up a wheelchair for you, you free-loading bastard!

524
00:41:04,022 --> 00:41:06,039
给我们讲讲枪战的事
So tell us about the shoot-out.

525
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,055
其实  我只是尽职而已
You know... Just doing my job.

526
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:13,038
前后也就大概5秒钟吧
Whole thing was over in about five seconds.

527
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:15,054
我说  沃尔特
Say, Walt, you know,

528
00:41:15,054 --> 00:41:17,065
你怎么样
How are you?

真的  我感觉很好
Really, I'm feeling fine.

531
00:41:25,071 --> 00:41:28,006
医生把这叫做
The doctor is calling it a...

532
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:32,081
"孤立发作的暂时性记忆丧失"
An "isolated episode of transient global amnesia."

533
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:33,095
什么鬼东西
Damn.

534
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,055
就是说非复发性的
Which means non-recurring.

535
00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:38,095
"非复发性"  听起来不错
"Non-recurring." That sounds good.

536
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,018
确实不错
Sounds real good.

537

我跟你说  你回来真好

You really gave us a scare.

539
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:46,060

540
00:41:48,037 --> 00:41:52,006
我不知道怎么说好  你出去找我
I don't know what to say. You going out there looking for me

541
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:54,081
遇到了危险  我很...
Put you in danger, and I'm so...

542
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:59,078
抱歉  不止是抱歉  完全不止
Sorry, sorry doesn't even cut it. Not nearly.

543
00:42:00,088 --> 00:42:04,009
你担心的就是这个  别傻了
Is that what you're worried about? Forget it. At the office,

544
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,093
同事都拿我当艾略特·奈斯崇拜呢
They're treating me like I'm Elliot Ness, okay?

545
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:06,064
[艾略特·奈斯  因打击酒类走私著称
可参见著名影片《不可触犯》]

546
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:08,018
他们给我开派对
They threw me a party,

547
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:10,007
丫头们给我烤巧克力蛋糕
The gals baked me a chocolate-chip cake

548
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:11,075
跟你说你都不信
Like you wouldn't believe, okay?

549
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,075
你以后得多失踪几次
You oughtta disappear more often.

550
00:42:15,037 --> 00:42:17,000
开个玩笑  你可千万别
Just kidding. Don't do that.

551
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:21,074
你看  看他们送给我什么
Hey, look. Look what they gave me.

552
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,097
这是什么
What is it?

553
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:29,001
这个  是我打死那个人的牙贴
That, gentlemen, is the grill of the guy I shot.

554
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,077
他的牙贴
His grill?

555
00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:34,014
对  他门牙上镶着这个
Yeah, it kind of goes over the front teeth like that, you know?

556
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:36,034
大概是时髦装饰吧
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

557
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:39,030
有人就是喜欢亮闪闪的东西
Certain folks are attracted to shiny things.

558
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:41,002
酷啊
Wow, cool.

559
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:11,019
回家真是无法形容地好
I can't tell you how good it feels to be home.

560
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:20,004
我把这些拿去洗了
I'll get these in the wash.

561
00:43:58,063 --> 00:43:59,067
亲爱的
Say, honey,

562
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,099
我想去趟7-11便利店
I was just thinking about going out to 7-11.

563
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,025
你要什么吗
Do you need anything?

564
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:13,023
自由斟[一款饮料  也叫重量杯]
Big Gulp?

565
00:44:14,005 --> 00:44:15,031
牛肉条[一种零食]
Slim Jim?

566
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:29,033
斯凯勒  听我说
Skyler, listen to me.

567
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:36,065
这种事不会再发生了  我不会的
This will not happen again, okay? I won't let it.

568
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:39,086
我还在  很清醒
I'm still here. I'm me.

569
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:43,050
我们会没事的
And we're gonna be okay.

570
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:56,057
你是不是有别的手机
Do you have a second cell phone?

571
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:01,046
别的手机
A second cell phone?

572
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,068
你失踪那天晚上
The night you disappeared,

573
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:05,020
我泡澡的时候你走进来
You came in when I was taking a bath, and...

574
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:08,022
看上去很沮丧
You were very upset.

575
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,008
就像是发生了什么可怕的事情
It was like something terrible had happened.

576
00:45:12,006 --> 00:45:15,005
后来你手机响了
And then your cell phone rang.

577
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:18,010
我见你看了看号码  接了电话  然后
I saw you check the number, and then you got up and...

578
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,091
就那么消失了
Just... disappeared.

579
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:26,089
可是汉克查你通话记录的时候
And when Hank checked your phone records,

580
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:29,020
那个时间根本没有通话
There was no call.

581
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:33,027
我知道的那部手机没有通话记录
No call on the phone I know about.

582
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,098
那可真
That is...

583
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:41,094
奇怪
Odd.

584
00:45:43,004 --> 00:45:45,014
我完全不记得了
I don't remember any of that.

585
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:47,059
但我确定一件事
But one thing I am sure of is

586
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:50,047
我没有别的手机
That I don't have a second cell phone.
