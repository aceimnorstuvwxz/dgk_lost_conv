120
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:31,072
我当时正在等红灯
I was sitting at a stoplight,

想我自己的事  那个...

我才不管  那钱是我的  你欠我
Whatever, man. You owe me that money.

125
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:41,088
-让我跟他讲  -我不欠你

我什么都不欠你的
I owe you nothing,

127
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,043
这件事情我会查清楚  你要信任我

我告诉你不要用我的配方
I told you not to cook my formula,

134
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:57,009
可你自顾自的就用了
and you went ahead and did it anyway.

135
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:59,005
我又没跟你保证我不用
Cause I never said I wouldn't cook it

136
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:03,010
配方又不是你的  是我们共有  懂吗  贱人
Cause it ain't yours. It's ours. Plural, bitch.

137
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:05,007
你未经我的允许

144
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:19,068
全天24小时闷在房车里...
I will rock that RV 24...

145
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,045
封得太严
It's buttoned up tight.

146
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,072
毛都瞧不见
Can't see a damn thing.

147
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:30,042
我觉得不像
I ain't feeling it.

148
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,079
没烟  没味道  没废弃物
No smoke, no smell, no waste.

149
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:34,042
不可能是制毒的
There's no cook.

150
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,046
可能是他们做的局
Could be they're setting up.

151
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,056
我听见里面有动静
I heard movement inside.

152
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,010
我看今晚就这样吧
I say we call it a night,

153
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,083
有了搜查证再来
come back with a search warrant.

154
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:45,003
不能让这浑球溜出我的视线
I'm not letting this sucker out of my sight.

155
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:47,090
一定有办法的
There's got to be a way.

156
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:50,051
一定有办法  一定有办法
There's got to be a way. There's got to be a way.

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,007
不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

158
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,096
你他妈的在那里干什么
What the hell you doing up there?

159
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:56,003
-你这个变态  -操
- You some kind of a pervert? - Shit.

160
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:19,078
回到车上去  一切都很顺利
Go back to your trailers. Everything's okay.

161
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:26,012
那人是退伍军人  他很酷
Guy's VFW. He's cool.

162
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,068
好吧  听好了
All right, I'll tell you what.

163
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:28,058
我们得再进一步调查那对情侣
We're gonna check out a couple more.

164
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:30,036
差不多就一上午的时间  你觉得怎么样
Then we're gonna call it a morning. Okay? What do you say?

165
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:32,003
不行  我要回家
Can't. Gotta get home.

166
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:34,036
怎么  得了气管炎还是怎么了
Why, you leave your balls in your wife's purse or what?

167
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:37,013
我要回去整理东西
Gotta pack.

168
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,064
你要去哪里
Where you headed?

169
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:43,047
德克萨斯州
Texas.

170
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,053
是谁啊
Hey, there.

171
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:09,050
汉克
Hank?

172
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,050
汉克是你吗
Hank?

173
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:27,065
我可以进来吗
Can I come in?

174
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:30,005
宝贝
Hey, babe.

175
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,016
嗨
Hey.

176
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,002
昨晚怎么样
How did it go last night?

177
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:35,016
不错
Good.

178
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,057
抓到犯人了吗
Catch the bad guys?

179
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:40,033
没有
Uh, nope.

180
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,083
要我给你做早餐吗
Want me to make you some breakfast?

181
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:44,097
不用了  我...
Nah. I'm--

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,024
我洗完澡就得回去
I'm heading back out after this.

183
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,004
马上么
Now?

184
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:50,071
你整晚都在工作
You worked all night.

185
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:52,021
你得睡一会  汉克
Get some sleep, Hank.

186
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:53,071
那些休闲车跑不了多远的
Those RVs aren't going anywhere.

187
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:55,088
那是旅行房车  玛丽
They're recreational vehicles, Marie.

188
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:57,055
它们就是用来旅游的
That's what they do.

189
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:59,045
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

190
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:03,062
我和布朗卡谈过了
I spoke with Blanca.

191
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:07,032
她说史蒂芬会去埃尔帕索那里  是这样么
She said that Steven's going to El Paso?

192
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,070
没错
Yeah.

193
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:16,063
我想知道对此你有什么看法
I was just wondering how you feel about that.

194
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,093
我拒绝了
I turned it down.

195
00:14:18,097 --> 00:14:20,020
事情结束了
End of story.

196
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,067
好的  好的
Good, good.

197
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,077
我终于可以松一口气了
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

198
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,054
是的  我得留在这里
Yeah, well, I needed some time here

199
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:27,028
进行深入调查
because I'm deep into this investigation

200
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:29,068
但不能两头兼顾
and couldn't do both,

201
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,035
所以我擅自做了决定
so I made a judgment call.

202
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:41,086
你知道你可以向我倾诉  对吧
You know that you can talk to me about things, right?

203
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,039
你不必独自承担这一切
You don't have to go through this alone.

204
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,041
你都要把人逼死了
Do you ask me which lead bib to put on someone

205
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,040
还管这点屁事么
before you nuke them?

206
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:52,090
上帝  玛丽
Jesus, Marie.

207
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,004
我决定好了
I made a decision.

208
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,054
我不想讨论这些事了
I'm not going through anything.

209
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:59,094
我只想做好我的工作
I'm doing my job.

210
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,034
我想...
I would like--

211
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:04,041
我知道  你想在乔治敦有套公寓嘛
I know, I know, a condo in Georgetown. I know.

212
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,082
如果你让我说完
If you would let me finish,

213
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:10,062
我原本打算说我愿意听你发牢骚
I was going to say I'd like to be included.

214
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,059
仅此而已
That's all.

215
00:15:12,062 --> 00:15:15,016
你不用为我的事业担心
Don't you worry about my career.

216
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,066
没出啥问题
My career is just fine.

217
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,080
你不想去吗
Did you not want to go?

218
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:24,067
我没有责备的意思  我只是...
I don't blame you. I just--

219
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,097
你上班或者去哪儿要晚了吧
Aren't you late for work or something?

220
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,070
我是说  上次发生的事情
I mean, what happened last time,

221
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:29,094
那样的经历
it would make perfect sense

222
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:31,037
会让你再也不想回到那里
for you to not want to go back.

223
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,098
眼下我于此有要务在身
I'm on to some important stuff right here, right now,

224
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,011
跟墨西哥州没有丝毫关系
and Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to do with it.

225
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:38,021
总是有人怀疑
Anyone who doubts that--

226
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:40,079
我一直都表现出色
I'm doing some actual good out here,

227
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,085
但我得到的只有无耻诽谤
and all I get are these bullshit accusations!

228
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:46,099
为什么每个人都觉得我在游手好闲
What, everyone thinks I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.

229
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,099
我勤勤恳恳的工作  我知道我做的很好
But I'm onto something. I know it.

230
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:51,066
你能理解我么
You understand me?

231
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,056
你在听我说话吗
You hear me?

232
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,058
这是什么意思
What exactly is this?

233
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:11,005
我来告诉你我认为这是什么
I'll tell you what I think it is.

234
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:18,029
小花招  让我再次制毒的小花招
A ploy. A ploy to get me cooking again...

235
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,016
很明显就是这样
And an obvious one at that.

236
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:21,000
你什么意思
How do you mean?

237
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:26,082
就像我很确定你会雇佣瘾君子
As if I would seriously believe you would hire an addict.

238
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:29,022
杰西·平克曼吗
Jesse Pinkman?

239
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,037
你可以选择解释与否
Recovering or not--

240
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,040
之前你为他做担保
You vouched for him previously.

241
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,044
我相信了你的承诺
I took you at your word.

242
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,047
不  不  让我澄清一下
No, no, no, no, let me be clear.

243
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,031
一五一十的解释给你听
Let me be perfectly clear.

244
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:42,041
在我的监督下  杰西可以胜任工作
Jesse was capable of working under my supervision.

245
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:47,022
而凭此相信他可以单独制度
Trusting him with a solo venture,

246
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:51,099
则是另一回事
that's quite another matter.

247
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:54,016
没有我  他只能制造出
How he could possibly produce

248
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:57,063
二流的产品
anything other than a mediocre product at best.

249
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:01,016
据我所知  他的产品的确有点
I am told his product was more or less consistent

250
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,083
未达到我预期的质量
with the quality I had come to expect.

251
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:06,067
有点儿
More or less?

252
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,087
有点儿  你是说真的吗
More or less? Really?

253
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:11,001
真没想到
Wow.

254
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:14,064
伙计  那真是...
Boy, that is the--

255
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:16,014
我们能否抛开成见
Talk about setting the bar low.

256
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,008
除非你不想这样
Except you don't do that--

257
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:24,055
不计前嫌
set the bar low.

258
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,031
那么  我应该得出什么结论
Therefore, what conclusion am I left to draw? Hm?

259
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:31,093
你坚信
That you believe

260
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:35,046
在我的配方专利问题上
I have some proprietary kind of selfishness

261
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,050
我很自私
about my own formula.

262
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:38,083
是这样吗
Hm?

263
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:43,017
我猜你是觉得
Some sort of overweening pride, I suppose,

264
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,051
我的高傲自大
that you think

265
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:48,024
拖累了我
simply overwhelms me,

266
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:51,015
蒙蔽了我的双眼
clouds my judgment.

267
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:52,048
但事实并非如此
But it doesn't.

268
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:55,015
当然不是
Absolutely not.

269
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:57,082
我只不过是在向化学致敬
I simply respect the chemistry.

270
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:02,066
这门科学必须受到尊重
The chemistry must be respected.

271
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:08,006
我为我之前的态度向你道歉
I apologize for being so transparent.

272
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,020
你愿意跟我跑一趟吗
Would you take a drive with me?

273
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:16,020
我想给你看些东西
I'd like to show you something.

274
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:02,012
一切顺利吗
Hi. Is everything okay?

275
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,092
她刚喝完一整瓶
She's already finished an entire bottle,

276
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:07,009
但看起来还很饿  后来她睡着了
but she still seemed hungry. Than she fell asleep.

277
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,049
我想等她醒来后再给她喝一瓶
I was thinking I'd give her another when she wakes up.

278
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:11,099
好的好的  当然可以
Yeah-- yeah, yeah, absolutely.

279
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,013
没问题  把宝宝养的白白胖胖的
Absolutely. Fatten that baby up.

280
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:15,096
我会的
Will do.

281
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:22,077
恩  就这些吗
Um...was that it?

282
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,021
你在哪里  在工作吗
So where are you. Are you at work?

283
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,017
是的  我正在工作
Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.

284
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:29,034
我不能讲太久
I-- I shouldn't be much longer.

285
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,082
有什么事吗
Is that okay?

286
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:32,089
你知道我很爱这个小小粉嫩宝贝
You know I love my little Pookums.

287
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:35,013
我想  今后的18年
You can leave her with me for the next 18 years

288
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:36,033
都可以由我来照顾她
as far as I'm concerned.

289
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:38,097
太好了
Great.

290
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,027
谢谢你  玛丽
Thanks, Marie.

291
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,017
你...确定没有问题了吗
Are you-- Are you sure you're okay?

292
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:50,081
亲爱的  怎么了
Sweetie, what is it?

293
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,018
告诉我吧
Come on.

294
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:54,088
是汉克
It's Hank.

295
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,035
他怎么了
What about him?

296
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:01,079
我不知道  该如何与他交流
I don't know how to talk to him.

297
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,062
我不知道还能和他说什么
I don't know what to say to him anymore.

298
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:05,059
我不知道...
I don't know how to--

299
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:06,086
自从埃尔帕索...
Ever since El Paso--

300
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:10,083
可能更早...
Ever since maybe before...

301
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:12,083
是的
Yeah.

302
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,077
天知道他在那里到底遭受了什么
God knows he went through a lot down there.

303
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,077
同事就在他眼前被炸死
People blown up right in front of him,

304
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,059
血溅得到处都是
blood everywhere,

305
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:23,017
上个星期
and last week

306
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,041
埃尔帕索说想要他归队
El Paso said they want him back.

307
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:25,098
然后呢
Yeah?

308
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:29,048
他没有答应  史蒂芬·戈麦斯会顶替他
He's not going. Steve Gomez is going in his place, and...

309
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:33,018
我也不清楚自己的想法
I don't know how I feel about that.

310
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,056
留在这里他肯定更安全  不是么
Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here, isn't he?

311
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,053
当然  但我希望他一切平安
Of course, and I want him safe.

312
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:43,089
我不知道他想要什么
I can't tell what he wants.

313
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:46,020
他从来不向我提起
He won't talk to me.

314
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,073
他几乎不回家
He hardly even comes home.

315
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,027
没日没夜的工作
He works all day, all night.

316
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,007
几乎不吃东西  也不怎么和我说话
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

317
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,007
就好像有什么东西把他掏空了一样
It's like something's eating him away from inside.

318
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:57,007
他变了
He's just not the same.

319
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,048
变了很多
He's not.

320
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,051
直面死亡  人会改变很多
Facing death, it changes a person.

321
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:05,008
肯定是这样  你觉得呢
It has to, don't you think?

322
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:09,002
我猜你也注意到沃尔特的变化了
I guess you've notice a change in Walt.

323
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,052
请进
Please.

324
00:22:58,056 --> 00:22:59,076
这是什么地方
What is this?

325
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,040
你的新实验室
Your new lab.

326
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,057
天啊
My God.

327
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:58,012
钍氧化物
Thorium oxide...

328
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:01,036
用作催化剂床层
for a catalyst bed.

329
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:06,020
看看这反应器尺寸
Look at the size of this reaction vessel.

330
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:09,097
怎么会有1200升这么大的容积
Why, that's got -- that's got to be 1,200 liters.

331
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,090
你  你
Where-- Where--

332
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:19,021
你怎么知道如何把这些组合在一起的
How did you know how to put this all together?

333
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:23,015
有像你一样的高人相助
I had excellent help, as will you.

334
00:24:26,018 --> 00:24:27,092
为这可筹划了好一阵子
Quite a lot of planning went into this.

335
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:32,032
我看也是
I would say so.

336
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:33,066
楼上的洗衣房
The laundry upstairs--

337
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:35,026
我经营多年了
I've owned it for years.

338
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:36,052
每周都会收到
It receives large

339
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,093
大量洗涤剂之类的东西
chemical deliveries on a weekly basis, detergent and such.

340
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:43,008
完全不惹人怀疑
There is nothing suspicious about it,

341
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,008
当然  我的手下
and my employees, to be sure,

342
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:47,067
都训练有素  值得信赖
are well-trained, trustworthy.

343
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:52,013
空气过滤系统是最新进的
The filtration system is state-of-the-art.

344
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:54,087
它只会排放出干净无味的蒸汽
It will vent nothing but clean, odorless steam,

345
00:24:55,005 --> 00:24:56,089
就和普通洗衣房的蒸汽一样
just as the laundry does,

346
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:59,039
排烟管道也是一样的
and through the very same stacks.

347
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:04,066
我每周需要200磅[约92千克]
I need 200 pounds per week

348
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,086
这样才能维持这里的开销
to make this economically viable.

349
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,091
当然  只要你完成每周的任务
You would choose your own hours, of course,

350
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:13,058
你可以自己安排时间
come and go as you please

351
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,075
想来就来  想走便走
so long as the quota is met.

352
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,057
抱歉
Sorry.

353
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,024
我还是不同意
The answer is still no.

354
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:51,096
我已经做了一系列错误的决定
I have made a series of very bad decisions,

355
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:54,029
不能再继续错下去了
and I cannot make another one.

356
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,052
你为什么做了那些决定
Why did you make these decisions?

357
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:59,012
为了我的家庭
For the good of my family.

358
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,093
那么那些决定就没有错
Then they weren't bad decisions.

359
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,083
沃尔特  男人应该做什么
What does a man do, Walter?

360
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:14,018
男人要挣钱养家
A man provides for his family.

361
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:17,018
但这勾当让我失去了家庭
This cost me my family.

362
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:20,029
只要你的孩子在  家就在
When you have children, you always have family.

363
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,049
他们就是你最关心的  是你的责任
They will always be your priority, your responsibility,

364
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:27,059
作为男人  就要养家糊口
and a man-- a man provides.

365
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:31,090
就算他不被理解
And he does it

366
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:34,073
不受尊敬
even when he's not appreciated

367
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:37,017
甚至不再被爱着
or respected

368
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,044
他依然要这么做
or even loved.

369
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:43,024
他就这么担起一切  毫无怨言
He simply bears up, and he does it...

370
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:47,048
只因  他是男人
because he's a man.

371
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,054
要不要随便吃点
Any chance we could grab a quick bite?

372
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:13,061
街角的泰国菜馆很不错
Thai place around the corner's pretty good.

373
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,091
我真的得回家了
Um, I really gotta head home.

374
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,091
好吧  那改天吧
All right, rain check, then.

375
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,083
她说那是豆腐
She said it was the tofu.

376
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,061
不管怎么说  她真可爱
Whatever. She's still cute anyways.

377
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:57,053
晚饭很棒  妈妈
Uh, great-- great dinner, Mom.

378
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,045
是啊
Yeah.

379
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:05,056
我能离开一下吗
Um, can I be-- can I be excused?

380
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:08,066
做作业还是玩游戏
To do homework or to play videogames?

381
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,063
我能一心二用
I can multitask.

382
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:15,037
去吧
Go ahead.

383
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:03,079
你想抱抱她吗
You want to take her?

384
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:15,024
是啊
Yeah.

385
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:18,077
说点什么  安迪  快点
Give me something, Andy. Come on.

386
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:30,008
房车被焊进了一栋房子的后面  真经典
Welded onto the back of a house. Wow, that's classy.

387
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:31,075
天啊
Christ.

388
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:35,005
好的好的  谢谢
Okay. Okay, thanks.

389
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,070
喂  詹妮斯  詹妮斯
Hey, Janice. Janice.

390
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:54,027
最后一辆吗
That the last one?

391
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,047
抱歉  汉克  车管所注册的就这么多
Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had--

392
00:30:57,051 --> 00:31:00,064
一共29辆注册在新墨西哥州的80年代房车
29 early '80s Bounders registered in New Mexico.

393
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:02,075
你能再核对一遍吗
Could you check again?

394
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:05,068
现在么
Now?

395
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,048
派对完了我再弄行吗
Can I do it after the party?

396
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:09,075
詹妮斯  我...
Janice, I'm--

397
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,025
我彻底歇菜了
I'm dead in the water here.

398
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:13,096
好吧  我会再核对的
Okay, I'll check.

399
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,079
谢谢
Thanks.

400
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:36,068
格米  小鸟要出巢了
Gomie, time for the little bird to fly the nest, huh?

401
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:40,002
他们真是选对了人
They got the right guy for the job,

402
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:42,039
尤其是要和那些墨西哥人打交道
specially since the bean-speak comes natural and all.

403
00:31:42,078 --> 00:31:44,099
想知道西班牙语里"去死吧"怎么说吗
Wanna know how to say "Get bent" In Spanish?

404
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:47,092
别怪我老土  行吗
Just don't go native on me, all right?

405
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,020
哦  对了
Oh, uh--

406
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:56,003
伙计
Hey, uh--

407
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:57,077
给你
Here.

408
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,035
知己知彼  百战不殆
Know your enemy and all.

409
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,056
好好打一仗  兄弟
Fight the good fight, brother.

410
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,087
我会的
I will.

411
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
有喝的吗
What have we got to drink around here?

412
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:29,029
你的直觉是对的
Your hunch was right.

413
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,099
还有一辆房车
One more RV.

414
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:34,049
车管所说注册没有续期
DMV said the registration wasn't renewed,

415
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:36,033
之后他们意识到  这辆车要么注册成非运营车辆
but then they realized it was never filed

416
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:38,073
要么就是被销毁了
as non-operational or destroyed.

417
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:40,023
也没有警方的报告
No police report, either.

418
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:08,005
我现在真的不知道
I just don't know

419
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:10,099
自己到底在干什么  明白么
what the hell I'm doing anymore, you know?

420
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:13,089
我好像被困住了
It's like I'm paralyzed,

421
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,065
不论我采取怎样的行动
like if I take a step in any direction,

422
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:20,080
都会犯下一个严重的错误
I'm going to make a spectacular mistake.

423
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:25,024
天啊  我真想借酒浇愁
God, I could go for a glass of wine about now.

424
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:29,001
你想去...
You want to go to--

425
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,044
算了  别在意
Sorry, never mind.

426
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:37,058
不管怎么说  有个事
Anyway, breaking news is

427
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:40,022
我现在和我的老板上床
I am sleeping with my boss,

428
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:42,086
但我不知道为什么
and I don't know why.

429
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:44,079
-哇  -是啊
- Wow. - Yep.

430
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,076
我撒谎了
That's a lie.

431
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,047
我知道为什么
I do know why.

432
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:58,020
他是个有魅力的男人
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

433
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:01,077
他是个很好的人
He's-- He's a really good person,

434
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:04,048
但是我们并不会....
but, I mean, it's not like we're ever gonna--

435
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:11,008
不知怎么的  我自己也不能相信
Somehow, and I can't actually believe it,

436
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:14,015
但我全家
but my entire family

437
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,016
都说我是...
sees me as some sort of--

438
00:35:18,056 --> 00:35:19,093
我亲妹妹
my own sister,

439
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:21,036
我妹夫
my brother-in-law.

440
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,070
我那十多岁的儿子都说我是个婊子
My teenage son tells me I'm a bitch.

441
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:31,020
你让我告诉他真相
And you say tell him the truth.

442
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:36,011
告诉他  他爸爸是究竟是怎样的人
Tell him about his father,

443
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:39,065
我做不到
but I can't...ever.

444
00:35:41,018 --> 00:35:42,068
我怎么能
How could I?

445
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:44,025
现在和我上床的这个人
And this man that I'm seeing,

446
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:47,059
尽管我知道这不对
you know, as wrong as I know it is,

447
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,049
但我仍然要这么做
as much as I know I'm probably doing it

448
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:50,082
我想让沃尔特离开我
just to make Walt leave me,

449
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:55,026
一天中  这是唯一不令我
it is the only thing in my day

450
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,033
感到自己正在...
where I don't feel...

451
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:03,020
正在...
like I'm...

452
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:05,074
沉沦的事情
drowning.

453
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:12,081
他知道你外面有男人的咯
So he knows about this other man?

454
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:14,041
知道
Yeah.

455
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:18,048
他会签离婚文件吗
So then he'll sign?

456
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:23,012
沃尔特说他哪也不会去
Um, Walt says he's not going anywhere,

457
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,026
所以
so that's a--

458
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,059
这招对付我太管用了
that's a really brilliant gambit on my part.

459
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:28,026
是啊
Yep.

460
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,006
聪明
Genius.

461
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,041
他把钱藏在家里
He keeps money in the house.

462
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:46,038
你丈夫  那个毒贩
Your husband, the drug dealer?

463
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,011
有多少钱
How much money?

464
00:36:49,015 --> 00:36:50,098
我没数
I didn't count it.

465
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:53,002
钱很重
It's-- It's heavy.

466
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:57,006
都放在一个包里
The bag where he keeps it.

467
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:03,030
你是在求我让你花那笔钱吗
Are you asking my permission to spend this money?

468
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:05,013
不  天啊  不是
No. God, no.

469
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:08,013
不  我只是
I-- No, I'm just, you know--

470
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,070
我不过是想谈谈而已
I'm just trying to just talk it through. That's--

471
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:14,027
我得说明一点  在律师这做心理辅导
Let me just say that I'm half as qualified

472
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,021
可是双倍的价钱  一半的疗效
and twice the price of a therapist.

473
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:18,038
这没什么好讨论的  斯凯勒
There is nothing to discuss here, Skyler.

474
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,071
我只是陈述
I'm just saying, you know?

475
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:23,012
我们曾是夫妻
We have a history.

476
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:25,032
他还是孩子的父亲
He's the father of my children,

477
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:28,035
可能他的所作所为
and maybe what he did, he--

478
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,052
是为了这个家  对吧
He did it for the family. Right?

479
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:32,076
好吧  动动脑子
Well, guess what.

480
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,056
这完全是胡扯
That is one enormous load of horse shit.

481
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,016
好吧
Okay.

482
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,010
我得简单为你说明一下
I'm going to spell this out as simply as I can for you.

483
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:41,083
你要是在那屋子
You are a fool

484
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:43,027
再多呆一分钟
to stay in that house

485
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,047
你就是一个大笨蛋
one minute longer.

486
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:47,087
他不走就你走
If your husband won't leave, then you go.

487
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:50,051
你现在可犯了知情罪了
You are now an accessory after the fact.

488
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:51,071
会被判刑
You are culpable.

489
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:52,098
你  还有孩子
You, your children,

490
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:55,011
你们会一无所有
you could lose everything you own.

491
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:57,035
懂吗
Do you understand?

492
00:37:57,038 --> 00:37:59,076
你不离婚
All courtesy of this criminal

493
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,089
就是在包容罪犯
you refuse to divorce.

494
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:04,076
我并没有嫁给一个罪犯
I didn't marry a criminal.

495
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,026
但现在是了
Well, you're married to one now.

496
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:29,038
我们再练习一遍
Hows about we run through this thing one more time,

497
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:31,032
特别是该由我说话的地方
especially the part where I do all the talking

498
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,052
你别插嘴
and you don't say jack?

499
00:39:32,055 --> 00:39:34,022
我就要插嘴
Oh, I'm going to say jack.

500
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:35,042
还要大说特说
I'm going to say plenty.

501
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:37,089
我们这是在互相较劲吗
What did we say about escalating, huh?

502
00:39:37,093 --> 00:39:39,036
过去是谁为你擦屁股的
Who's got your back here, hm?

503
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,066
是我  好了  这事我来搞定
Me. All right? I'm going to take care of things.

504
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,019
可你打算怎么让自己
Hey, what are the parameters

505
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:45,017
能够一直保持清醒呢
of this sobriety thing you got going?

506
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,050
什么意思
What do you mean?

507
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:47,077
你能吃安宁神吗
Can you take a Xanax?

508
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,000
我这儿有一抽屉
'Cause I got a drawer full of them.

509
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:53,001
"脊椎神经医师"给我配的
I get them from my "Chiropractor."

510
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:55,034
越南人  1米52
Vietnamese, 5 foot tall,

511
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:58,005
她能让你安眠到天亮
she adjusts you to completion.

512
00:39:59,002 --> 00:40:00,095
她叫金玉霜
Her name's Kim Nu Suong,

513
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:04,065
人如其名
as delicious as it sounds.

514
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,099
我该把她的名片给你
I should give you her card.

515
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:10,022
让这些玩意见鬼去吧
To hell with this.

516
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:15,063
让他进来
Send him in.

517
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,034
你好  沃尔特
Hello, Walt.

518
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:22,047
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

519
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:27,007
请坐这边
Please, have a seat... here.

520
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:28,098
平克曼先生  你也请坐
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

521
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:32,035
你来晚了
You're late.

522
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:36,045
先生们  如果我们都已达成共识
Gentlemen, if we could come to some accommodation here now.

523
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:38,025
那么一切都将迎刃而解
There's always a way to oil everyone's lock.

524
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:40,029
这位年轻小伙
This young man

525
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:41,079
很善心地打算为你
is prepared to offer you

526
00:40:41,082 --> 00:40:45,053
提供分红
a sweetheart of a deal doing precisely nothing.

527
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,073
是吗
Really?

528
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,076
他以后独自制毒所得
10 percent of all future profits

529
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,050
收益的10%归你
from his solo venture

530
00:40:51,053 --> 00:40:54,060
你只需直接去信箱拿这笔钱就好
is money you get paid for walking down to the mailbox.

531
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:57,097
只管把它当成
Consider it a gesture of respect

532
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:59,071
对于你目前所做的贡献
for your valuable contributions

533
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:00,098
而表示的一份心意吧
to the business thus far.

534
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,054
我肯定你会欣然接受
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

535
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:06,075
就是笔施舍费
That's charity, is what that is.

536
00:41:06,078 --> 00:41:08,048
所有事都由我搞定
I do all the work.

537
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:11,052
他则无所事事  说长道短
He sits around on his fat a-- judging people.

538
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:13,089
喂  喂  别火上浇油
Hey, hey, hey. Escalating.

539
00:41:13,092 --> 00:41:15,029
够了
Stop.

540
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:16,088
大致就是这样
So here's that,

541
00:41:16,088 --> 00:41:19,009
但出了点小问题
but then there's one small detail.

542
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:21,046
显然我们的联络人
Clearly a mistake was made

543
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,080
出了点状况
on the part of our mutual associate

544
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,030
他把杰西挣的另一半钱给了你
when he paid you half of Jesse's earnings.

545
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,007
他显然还不知道
He must not have realized that you two

546
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,097
你们俩已经分道扬镳了
had come to a parting of the ways.

547
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,097
拿去  归你了
Take it. It belongs to you.

548
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,048
你他妈太对了  本来就是我的
You're damn right it belongs to me.

549
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:37,014
我就知道你们俩客气着呢
I knew I could count on you boys to play nice.

550
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:39,071
快把我感动地泪流满面了
That's-- That almost brings a tear to my eye.

551
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:43,012
尽情享用吧  趁着年轻
Enjoy it. Spend it in good health.

552
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:47,079
这是你在这行的最后一桶金了
That is the last money you'll ever earn in this business.

553
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:49,089
你他妈什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

554
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:54,016
好吧  我本不想讲清楚  杰西
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse,

555
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,067
但我们的联络人
but our mutual associate

556
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:01,097
只是利用你  找到我而已
was only using you to get to me.

557
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,020
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

558
00:42:03,024 --> 00:42:08,008
正如你所见  他更需要有此专长的人
You see, he needs someone with expertise,

559
00:42:08,044 --> 00:42:10,061
一个清楚他意图的人
someone who knows what he's doing.

560
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:14,072
换句话说  他需要的是我
In other words, he needs me.

561
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:17,096
你是想说  你又开始制毒了吗
You're telling me you're cooking again?

562
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:20,029
正是
Yeah, uh--

563
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:21,069
该怎么向你解释呢
How should I put this?

564
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:27,087
我入伙了  你出局了
I'm in. You're out.

565
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:33,087
沃尔特  等一下
Whoa, whoa, Walt, hold on there.

566
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:35,031
冒昧地问一句
Uh, what was the offer,

567
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:38,008
报酬是多少
if I may ask?

568
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:42,095
三个月  三百万
It's, uh, 3 million for three months of my time.

569
00:42:42,098 --> 00:42:45,028
你需要把这些钱洗白吧
What You're gonna need that money laundered, right?

570
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:46,059
理所当然
I mean, of course.

571
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:47,092
我们之前怎么说的
What was our deal before?

572
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:49,086
17%  有点虚高
17 percent. That's a shade high.

573
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:52,006
那就15%吧
Let's settle on an even 15.

574
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:53,046
这个数不错
That's a nice round number.

575
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:54,069
5%
5 percent.

576
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:56,016
-14%也很公平  -5%
- 14's fair. - 5.

577
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,063
-13%  -5%
- 13. - 5.

578
00:42:57,066 --> 00:42:59,033
12%  看在以往情面上  12%
12. For old time's sake, 12.

579
00:42:59,062 --> 00:43:00,062
5%
5.

580
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:03,039
我是个通情达理的人  而且是短期合作
I'm a reasonable guy. It's a short-term deal.

581
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:04,045
那就10%吧
10 even,

582
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:07,003
不能再低了  给我点面子
but I can't go any lower and still respect myself.

583
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:09,057
-就5%吧  -这是怎么一回事
- 5. - What in the hell just happened?

584
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,030
你是我的律师  不是他的
You're my lawyer, not his!

585
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:13,080
这就是现实  孩子
That's the way of the world, kid.

586
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:15,097
弱肉强食
You go with the winner.

587
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,001
你以为这样就能让我罢手吗
You think this'll stop me from cooking?

588
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:20,001
悉听尊便
Cook whatever you like...

589
00:43:20,004 --> 00:43:24,008
继续加你的辣椒面或是其他垃圾
As long as it's that ridiculous "Chili P" Or some other drek,

590
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:27,062
但别妄想用我的配方
but don't even think about using my formula.

591
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:30,082
尽管放马过来吧  贱人
Just try and stop me, bitch.

592
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:22,064
有事吗
Yes?

593
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:23,097
是奥尔特加夫人吗
Hi, there, uh, Mrs. Ortega?

594
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:25,001
是我
Yes.

595
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:26,034
你好  我是汉克·施拉德
Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

596
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,024
毒品缉私局警员
I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

597
00:44:28,028 --> 00:44:30,061
我们正在调查一辆休闲车
We're interested in an RV

598
00:44:30,065 --> 00:44:32,068
是用你的名字和地址注册
that's registered to your name and address.

599
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:35,048
你买过休闲车吗
Uh, do you have an RV?

600
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:36,075
我买过
I did.

601
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,069
但几个月前被偷了
It was stolen months ago.

602
00:44:39,037 --> 00:44:40,076
被偷了
Stolen, huh?

603
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:43,085
对此我很好奇
Well, then I'm curious as to

604
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:45,062
为何失窃没有上报呢
why the theft was never reported.

605
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:48,065
在警局或是车管所并没有相关记录
I'm not seeing any records of it with the police or the DMV.

606
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:51,075
我没有时间
I just... didn't get around to it.

607
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:53,025
我能问问原因吗
May I ask why?

608
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:58,013
有了车  就能和家人
I mean it's a-- it's a great way to get the family together

609
00:44:58,016 --> 00:44:59,063
一起平价出游
for an affordable vacation.

610
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:01,063
所以车子丢了  你一定很心痛
It must've been quite a blow when it went missing.

611
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:04,090
确实如此
It was.

612
00:45:04,093 --> 00:45:06,060
你觉得
Do you have any ideas at all

613
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:08,004
会是谁偷了车子呢
who might've taken it?

614
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,097
我不想看他被捕
I didn't want him arrested.

615
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,038
他虽终日与坏人厮混
He ran with a bad crowd,

616
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:17,048
但本质不坏
but he was never a bad person.

617
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:20,015
我相信他会重新做人
I thought he could turn his life around.

618
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:22,005
你说的是谁  奥尔特加夫人
Who are we talking about, Mrs. Ortega?

619
00:45:22,008 --> 00:45:25,002
我儿子
My son.

620
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:28,042
我真的很想和他谈谈
I'd really like to speak with him.

621
00:45:28,046 --> 00:45:29,086
他去世了
He's passed away.

622
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:31,099
两个月前被人枪杀
He was shot two months ago.

623
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,066
你儿子叫什么名字
What was your son's name?

624
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,073
克里斯蒂安
Christian.

625
00:45:36,077 --> 00:45:40,077
克里斯蒂安·奥尔特加
Christian Ortega.

626
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,051
他的绰号是康宝吗
Was his nickname "Combo"?

627
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:54,049
谢谢你的配合  感激之至
Thanks for this. I really appreciate it.
