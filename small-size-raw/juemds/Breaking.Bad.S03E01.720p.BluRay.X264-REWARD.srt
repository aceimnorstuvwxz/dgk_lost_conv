We interrupt our scheduled programming

插播一则重大新闻

17
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,034
下午好
Good afternoon.

18
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:19,097
刚刚的几分钟里
In the last several minutes,

19
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:22,034
KOB电视台收到了数十个
KOB has received dozens of reports

20
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:25,003
关于阿尔布开克东部一起
of what appears to be a crashed aircraft--

21
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:28,040
疑似两架航班相撞事故的电话
possibly two aircraft on Albuquerque's east side.

22
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:29,098
目前事故的细节尚不清楚
As of yet, details are scarce,

23
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:33,007
但据报告者描述  他们目睹了上空的爆炸
But callers describe witnessing an explosion overhead,

24
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,004
及其坠落的残骸  空中仍可见尘埃弥漫
followed by falling debris. Visible now toward...

25
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:37,010
国家运输安全委员会
...crash investigators

26
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,077
的事故调查人员
with the National Transportation Safety Board

27
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:41,091
将于今晚到达事故现场
are expected on-site as early as this evening.

28
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:43,014
但官员们也提醒
But officials warn that,

29
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:45,017
事故残骸覆盖面积如此之广
with a debris field of this magnitude,

30
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,018
调查和残骸清理工作可能会持续较长时间
the investigation and the clean-up may well stretch--

31
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:49,003
联邦航空管理局发言人称
...are now saying that the Boeing 737

32
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:52,086
该架波音737当时正在指挥塔调度下
was being re-routed or vectored through the airspace,

33
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,009
更改航线
which is standard procedure,

34
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:55,079
其间一切操作均符合规程
according to a spokesman for the FAA.

35
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,036
8座的空中之王350
The eight-seat King Air 350

36
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:01,093
是从犹他州的圣乔治城起飞
was a charter flight operating out of Saint George, Utah,

37
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:03,073
飞往德克萨斯州的阿马里洛
bound for Amarillo, Texas.

38
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:05,067
听上去像下冰雹
It sounded like hail.

39
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,047
石头一样的大冰雹
Like heavy hailstones.

40
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,020
简直就是...
It was just, um...

41
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:12,010
梆梆梆地砸落到整个街区
bump-bump-bump all over the neighborhood.

42
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:16,066
调查显示最终的遇难人数是167人
...indicating that the final death toll now stands at 167.

43
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,027
167人遇难
..67 muertos--

44
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,030
167人
...167...

45
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,048
此次空中相撞事件让人们不禁质疑
This mid-air collision has left many wondering

46
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,071
在如此严谨的安防措施下
how such an accident could take place

47
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,031
为何还会发生这样恶劣的事故
in a system with so many safeguards.

48
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:28,054
甚至有人指控造成5号航班
Allegations continue that the collision

49
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:30,041
撞机的原因
which brought down Flight 5

50
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:33,065
是错误的空中指挥
was caused by improper air traffic control.

51
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:37,002
这一惊人消息已被俄克拉荷马城的
The bombshell confirmation out of Oklahoma City today,

52
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,055
联邦航空管理局证明属实
as the FAA confirmed, it was, indeed,

53
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:42,022
事故归因为一名空中交通管制员的失误
a lone air traffic controller's fateful mistake...

54
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,066
这名男子的姓名是唐纳德·马戈利斯
...que el nombre del hombre es Donald Margolis.

55
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,053
是唐纳德·马戈利斯
...is Donald Margolis,

56
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,083
联邦航空管理局19年的老员工
a 19-year veteran of the FAA's

57
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:52,016
服务于阿尔布开克空中航线交通控制中心
Air Route Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque.

58
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,037
马戈利斯休假五周后
...Margolis recently returned to work

59
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,047
第一天开始工作
after a five-week absence,

60
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,050
休假原因  据称是亲人离世
which was due to, quote, a personal loss.

61
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,077
现已查明
While it's now known

62
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:02,008
马戈利斯的女儿一个月前
that Margolis had recently lost a daughter...

63
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:04,051
因吸毒过量死亡
...to a drug overdose a month before.

64
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:07,063
他的女儿名叫珍妮·马戈利斯  26岁
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis, aged 26,

65
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:10,055
有长期吸毒史
apparently had a long history of substance abuse.

66
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:13,046
马戈利斯家的朋友们认为  独生女儿的死
And friends of the family say the death of his only child

67
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:16,055
对他打击巨大
hit Margolis particularly hard.

68
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:19,012
由于两起事件相隔仅一个月
Coming as it did little more than a month before,

69
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:22,075
有人质疑他返岗工作的时间是否恰当
many are questioning the timing of his return to work,

70
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,099
并指问让这位悲恸的父亲
and are wondering how much blame truly lies

71
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:27,065
返岗工作的人该负何种责任
with those who let this grieving father--

72
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:51,006
不  不
No. No, no.

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,058
我通常会先说  你来到这里我很遗憾
I usually open with "So sorry you're here."

74
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:24,098
你想从哪里谈起
Where would you like to begin?

75
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:28,018
我只想快一点结束
I really just need this quick and easy, you know?

76
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:33,015
越快越好
As quick as something like this can be.

77
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,035
好的
Okay.

78
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:36,018
是双方的决定吗
Is that mutual?

79
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:37,085
你丈夫同意了吗
Does your husband go along with that?

80
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,039
他知情吗
Does he know?

81
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,066
我是说
Well, I mean,

82
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:45,016
他当然知道我们已经分开了  所以
he certainly knows we're separated, so--

83
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,079
他搬出去了吗
Has he moved out?

84
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,009
这事我们正在办
We're in the process of moving him out.

85
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:50,013
嗯  希望是  今天
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

86
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:52,030
现在  我的
And in the meantime, my--

87
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,030
儿子和女儿
my son and my daughter

88
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,037
跟我一起住在我妹妹家
and I are staying with my sister.

89
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,000
这么说是你搬出去了
So you've moved out?

90
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:00,050
是的  只是暂时的
Well, yes, just temporarily,

91
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:02,034
为了方便他收拾东西
only so he could get his things.

92
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:04,081
本该是上周搬的
That was supposed to happen last week,

93
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:07,001
但是发生了撞机  然后
but then came the crash, and--

94
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,014
哦  天哪
Oh, God.

95
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:09,055
你家不会是
You weren't one of the-- Right--

96
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:12,022
是的  就在航线正下方
Yeah. Right beneath the flight path.

97
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,055
然后
And, um...

98
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:17,019
我家的院子
uh, we had debris land in our yard

99
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,060
-和整个街区满是残骸  -太可怕了
- and all of our neighborhood, so-  - Mmm. Terrible.

100
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,073
是啊  甚至
Yeah. Apparently, even, um...

101
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:24,064
还有  尸体碎片
you know, parts of bodies,

102
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:29,034
所以我当然不能...
and so I certainly couldn't bring myself to--

103
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:31,084
-太可怕了  -是啊
- So awful. - I know.

104
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:35,001
我当时不能搬回去  但现在可以了
Anyway, I was certainly not ready to move back, but it's time.

105
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:40,008
我想我妹妹和妹夫一定被我们烦死了
I'm sure we're driving my sister and her husband up a wall.

106
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:44,025
你一定要回到自己家中居住
Well, you definitely want to maintain residency in your actual home.

107
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,082
在争取抚养权方面  才能占据主动
It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody.

108
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,052
你说你们有两个孩子
Two children, you said?

109
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:51,029
对  这是小女儿霍莉
Yes. Holly here,

110
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,039
还有个儿子在上高中
and then I have a son in high school--

111
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:56,003
名叫小沃尔特
Walter Junior.

112
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,083
他们得跟着我过
They need to stay with me.

113
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:02,003
了解
Okay.

114
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:03,034
结婚多久了
How long have you been married?

115
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,006
16年
Sixteen years.

116
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,015
住的不是公寓楼  是幢房子是吧
And it's not an apartment. It's a house that you live in?

117
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,033
贷款付清了吗
Do you own outright?

118
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:12,016
-仍在按揭吗  -对
- Do you have a mortgage? - Yes.

119
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,050
当然是按揭的  还有...
There's definitely a mortgage. We have, um...

120
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:16,093
大概15年贷款未付
maybe 15 years on it.

121
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:19,083
其他债务或资产呢
What about other debts or assets?

122
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,084
你对你们夫妻双方的财务状况
Do you feel you have a good understanding

123
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,097
是否有充分的了解
of you and your husband's financial situation?

124
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:29,076
你丈夫有工作吗
Is your husband employed?

125
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:30,085
我先跟你说清楚
You know what? Here's the thing.

126
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:32,025
我真的没想要
I-- I'm really not looking

127
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:35,088
找什么漏洞或是想...
for any, sort of, uh, loopholes or--

128
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,051
钻什么空子之类的
I don't know-- just-- No.

129
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:39,032
不是钻空子
No loopholes.

130
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:42,032
我只想让我的每位客户
I just intend that every one of my clients

131
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:44,029
对自己婚内的资产及负债状况
get a full and honest accounting

132
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:48,036
都能够有全面如实的了解
of what it is they owe and what it is they own.

133
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,063
为此  希望能够知无不言
To that end, I say let's leave no stone unturned.

134
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:56,012
你无法想象
You'd be amazed

135
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:58,044
有多少夫妻双方隐瞒财产的案例
what I've seen partners hide from one another.

136
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,035
沃尔特
Walt?

137
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,019
沃尔特  在家吗
Hey, Walt?

138
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:49,015
兄弟  你在这啊
Hey. Hey, buddy, there you are.

139
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:51,063
是这样的
Listen, I, uh-- You know, well--

140
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:55,068
差不多该出发了
It's, uh...time.

141
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:05,045
911以来最糟的一周  绝无仅有
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay? Bar none.

142
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,029
真的  不容置疑  绝对是的
Yeah, this is it. Hands down, we're living it.

143
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,060
我跟主管当局有些人谈过
I mean, I speak with some authority

144
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,096
在过去的数月里
because we definitely had some shitty weeks

145
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,026
有好几周都很糟很乱
in the past few months, you know?

146
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,023
但这周发生的事情  实在是...
But this here, I mean, call, you know--

147
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:15,070
简直能上吉尼斯世界记录
call freakin' the Guinness Book of World Records--

148
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:17,023
我是不是话太多了
Call freakin'-- Am I talking too much?

149
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,044
是吗  肯定是的吧  我就知道
Am I? I am, right? I am. I know. Look, look.

150
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:22,032
但你们俩现在这情况...
But this situation between you and, uh-- uh--

151
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,094
我不是打听八卦啊
I'm not asking, by the way.

152
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:25,068
这本就不关我的事
Okay? It's none of my business.

153
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:27,085
我也不想介入你们俩这事
I do not want to get in the middle of you two.

154
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:30,008
我的意思是...听一下总成吧
I'm just saying-- Listen, listen-- Okay?

155
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:32,082
你就当这是战略性转移吧 懂我意思
You beat a little tactical retreat. Yeah?

156
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,099
然后再回家来
And regroup.

157
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,072
然后...就没事了
And then-- bong.

158
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:38,062
小别一下  回来就好了...
You know, absence makes the--

159
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,073
我来帮你搬  我来帮你搬
I'm pulling for you, you know? I'm pulling for you--

160
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,080
别提重物
No heavy lifting.

161
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:57,036
-让我来  -没事  我来吧
- I got it. - No, it's okay.

162
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:59,025
让我来
I got it.

163
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:01,018
天哪
Jesus--.

164
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,018
你里面放的什么呀  煤渣砖吗
What do you got in there, cinder blocks?

165
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:08,080
五十万美元现钞
Half a million in cash.

166
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,079
要的就是这种精神
That's the spirit.

167
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:21,046
我来吧  我来吧
I got it. I got it.

168
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,045
谁是来这自我完善的
Who's here for self-improvement?

169
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:49,011
来  举个手
Come on, give me a show of hands.

170
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,046
你们哪位希望
Who among you is here hoping

171
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:56,027
自己从此能改过自新
they can actively improve who they are?

172
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,024
好了
All right.

173
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,084
这就是你们犯的第一个错误
See, that's your first mistake.

174
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:09,021
你们来这该学的  是自我接纳
You should be here to learn self-acceptance.

175
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,072
亲爱的
Hey, honey, you, uh--

176
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:19,032
再来块华夫饼干吗
you want another waffle?

177
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,002
我还没开始收拾
I still got the iron out.

178
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:25,059
还能帮你切点香蕉
I could cut up some bananas.

179
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:29,079
你好  这里是沃尔特  斯凯勒  弗林和霍莉家
Hi, you're reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn, and Holly.

180
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,006
有事请留言
Please leave us a message.

181
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,053
大家好
Uh, hey. Hello, everybody.

182
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:37,033
早  我只是来打个招呼
Good morning. I was just checking in

183
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:40,084
再知会下我最新的联系方式
and thought I'd pass along the current contact information.

184
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,041
当然  有事尽管打我手机
I mean, certainly, you can always reach me on my cell.

185
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:45,047
我肯定随身带着的
I've always got that on me.

186
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,020
但万一要寄信的话
But in terms of a mailing address,

187
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,084
我现在住在长船礁[酒店名]
I'm here at The Beachcomber.

188
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,018
这里真不错
And you know what? It's actually very nice.

189
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,065
非常舒适
It's very pleasant.

190
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:55,012
虽然没有奥克伍德[酒店式公寓名]那么高端
Not as high end as the Oakwood,

191
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:56,058
但作为一家酒店...
but, you know, not as corporate--

192
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,085
你能帮我...
Oh, hey, would you please just--

193
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,009
爸  是我
Hey, Dad. It's me.

194
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:03,036
不  我不好
No, I'm not okay.

195
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,093
我不知道到底怎么回事
I don't know what the hell is going on.

196
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,086
没人他妈的跟我说怎么回事
Nobody's telling me Jack shit around here.

197
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:09,023
-弗林  别说粗话  -随便吧
- Hey, Flynn.  - What-- Whatever.

198
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:11,056
我什么都无所谓了
I-- I don't even care anymore.

199
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,006
你能来载我去上学吗
Can-- Can you just give me a ride to school?

200
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,020
我可以送你去学校
I'll take you to school.

201
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:18,010
是的  不用
Yeah. No.

202
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:19,040
我现在就准备好出发了
I-- I'm ready now.

203
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,004
弗林  我来送你上学
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

204
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,041
好的  我来了
All right. I'm here.

205
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:27,001
待会见
See you soon.

206
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:50,083
请注意听我讲话
May I have your attention, please?

207
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:52,024
众所周知
As all of you know,

208
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:55,014
上周这座城市发生了一场可怕的悲剧
Last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy,

209
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:57,028
我们没有人会忘记
one that none of us will ever forget,

210
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:00,030
所以今天我们特意抽出时间
which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule

211
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,065
聚集到这里谈话
to gather in the gym and talk.

212
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,082
我只是觉得
I just find it,

213
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:08,079
真的
You know, really

214
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:11,076
无法集中精力
really hard to concentrate

215
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,062
因为这些我们经历的
Because of all the horrors,

216
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,063
可怕的事
You know, we perceived.

217
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:20,097
让你挥之不去
It just really gets inside your brain, and

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,064
就好像在大学里
in college they have this thing where,

219
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:25,059
如果...你室友自杀了
if your roommate kills himself

220
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,093
如果你回到寝室
like, if you come home

221
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:30,040
发现他在壁橱或者其他什么地方吊着
and find him hanging in the closet or whatever

222
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:34,037
悲恸感顿上心头
It's basically, like, an automatic "A" for you.

223
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,094
我觉得这种怜悯之心
And I just think that that kind of compassion is

224
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,015
-是一种...  -可以了
- is something to...  - Okay.

225
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,024
巴里  谢谢你
Thank you, Barry.

226
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,057
还有谁想发言
Who wants to go next?

227
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:48,021
没有对错 只要说出你们的感受
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.

228
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:50,081
心里怎么想的
You can say anything and everything

229
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,031
就怎么说
That's on your mind.

230
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:53,051
有人吗
Anyone?

231
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,001
亲爱的  说吧
There you go, honey.

232
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:03,078
我一直在扪心自问
I just keep asking myself

233
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,095
亲爱的  站起来说好吗
Honey, could you please stand up?

234
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,059
我一直自问  为什么会发生这种事
Just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?"

235
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,056
如果上帝真的存在
I mean, if there's a God and all,

236
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,086
他怎么能让这么多无辜的人
Why does he allow all those innocent people

237
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,056
无故死去
to die for no reason?

238
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,063
我们还是把眼光放在世俗好吗
Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?

239
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:27,086
不管怎样  我睡眠非常不充足
Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.

240
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,003
有人也像我一样吗
Does anyone else have that?

241
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:35,084
那个声音一直在耳边萦绕
I just keep hearing that...that sound.

242
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:39,084
爆炸声
That boom.

243
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:43,031
它一刻不休地在我脑海中回响
It just plays over and over in my head

244
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,088
好像永远不会停止
like it won't ever stop.

245
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:50,098
谢谢你  亲爱的
Thank you, sweetheart.

246
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:53,015
还有人想说吗
Is there anyone else?

247
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,049
我的邻居听到坠毁声
My neighbor, he heard the crash,

248
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,053
他跑到前院
and he ran out to his front yard,

249
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:09,023
他发现一个座椅
and he found, like, this seat

250
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,040
航空座椅
You know, like, an airline seat.

251
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:12,066
就是飞机里的那种
Like one you have on an airliner?

252
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:16,001
这个座椅稳稳当当地
Well, anyway, the seat was standing

253
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:18,018
立在他的院子里
perfectly upright in his front yard,

254
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:19,074
就在他的摩托艇旁边
right next to his Sea-Doos

255
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:21,045
是的  一艘海上摩托艇
Because, like, he has Sea-Doos

256
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,021
但是...
But...

257
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,058
就在椅子上  还有两条腿
there was still a pair of legs

258
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:28,032
卡在里面
buckled into them.

259
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,015
人的腿
Human legs.

260
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:37,069
你还好吧
You okay?

261
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:39,053
是的  抱歉
Yeah. Sorry.

262
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:42,003
我只是有点感触
I was just moved.

263
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:45,093
让我们也来听听家长的想法
Maybe we should hear from the faculty.

264
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:50,050
他们也同样经历了这场悲剧
Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.

265
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:54,044
怀特老师  你想说几句吗
Mr. White, would you like to say something?

266
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:59,014
首先欢迎你回来
And by the way, welcome back. Hmm?

267
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,045
你能回来实在是太好了
It's so good to have you back.

268
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:29,003
我想  我会
I guess what I would

269
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:30,057
抱歉  抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.

270
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:38,078
我想说的是...
I guess what I would want to say is...

271
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:41,085
要往好的方面看
to look on the bright side.

272
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:48,065
首先  地面上没有出现伤亡
First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.

273
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:52,012
我是说  这样的事故是发生在
And that  I mean, an incident like this

274
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:55,009
人口众多的市中心上空
over a populated urban center

275
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:58,002
却没有伤及市民
That right there, that's  that's just gotta be

276
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,069
可以说是个小小的奇迹了
some minor miracle, so

277
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:04,012
而且  两架飞机都没有坐满
Plus, neither plane was full.

278
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:06,079
那架波音737仅仅
You know, the  the 737 was

279
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,099
大概只有
Was what? Uh,

280
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:09,076
只有三分之二的乘客
Maybe two-thirds full, I believe.

281
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,076
对吗
Right? Yes?

282
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,033
或者是四分之三
Or maybe even three-quarters full.

283
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:15,080
不管怎么说
Well, at any rate,

284
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:19,070
就遇难人数来说
What you're left with casualty-wise is

285
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:22,031
这只不过是第50大空难
Just the 50th worst air disaster.

286
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:25,045
事实上  最多排在第50了
Actually, tied for 50th.

287
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:29,022
事实上
There are, in truth,

288
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:34,023
在历史上有53次这样的空难
53 crashes throughout history

289
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:37,027
有些比这次更糟
That are just as bad or worse

290
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,037
特内里费
Tenerife?

291
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,070
你们有人
Has anybody

292
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:41,007
听说过特内里费空难吗
Anybody hear of Tenerife?

293
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:43,007
没有吗
No?

294
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:48,011
1977年  两架满乘的波音747客机
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s

295
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,008
在特内里费上空相撞
crashed into each other on Tenerife.

296
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,028
你们知道一架波音747客机有多大吗
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?

297
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:57,070
那可比波音737大多了
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737.

298
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,022
更别说是两架撞一起
And we're talking about two of them.

299
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:04,003
600余人丧命特内里费
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

300
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:07,027
但你们对此还有印象吗
But if any of you even remember it at all?

301
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,073
还有人记得吗  我想没有
Any of you? I doubt it.

302
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,073
都知道为什么吗
You know why?

303
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:13,004
是因为
It's because...

304
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:15,057
人们都得往前看
people move on.

305
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:19,034
人们都往前看  我们也会
They just move on. And we will, too.

306
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,091
我们会往前看  我们会遗忘掉
We will move on, and we will get past this

307
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:23,075
这是人类的共性
because that is what human beings do.

308
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,022
我们能挺过去
We survive.

309
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:29,056
而且...
And, uh...

310
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:33,049
我们挺过去  并且 我们可以承受着一切
We survive, and-- and we-- we overcome.

311
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:37,069
对的 我们挺过去了 我们挺过去就
Yeah. We survive. We survive, and--

312
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:40,037
-非常感谢 -好的
Thank you. Okay.

313
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:43,070
谢谢你
Thank you.

314
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,073
很好
Good.

315
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,052
你小姨玛丽最近怎么样
Hey, how's your aunt Marie doing?

316
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:31,097
我想还好吧
Fine, I guess.

317
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,023
进去记得替我打个招呼
You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?

318
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:38,082
你自己干嘛不进去说 这也是你家啊
Why don't you just come inside? It's your house.

319
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,026
算了  我
No, I--

320
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:18,020
他走了
He's gone.

321
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:24,055
弗林回来啦
Hey, Flynn!

322
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:26,005
-你不舒服吗  -我很好  怎么了
- How's your Tricks  - I'm good. Why?

323
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,002
你看上去不舒服啊
Tricks. It's an expression.

324
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,055
还好吧
How are you?

325
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:32,049
你们为什么这么对他
Why do you gotta treat him like this?

326
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,099
你为什么要这样
Why you gotta be like this?

327
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:36,079
为什么你们就不能坐下来好好谈谈呢
Why can't you just talk, even?

328
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,076
冷静点 没事  没事的
Cool down. Okay. Okay.

329
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:53,084
终归还是个孩子啊
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

330
00:26:59,062 --> 00:27:01,039
尽量不要让这件事影响到他
You know, try not to hold it against him.

331
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:02,052
我是说
You know, I mean,

332
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:05,022
这个可怜的孩子
the poor kid, he's probably just

333
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:07,059
一定是很困惑
dying of curiosity.

334
00:27:07,063 --> 00:27:09,079
我觉得困惑与执著
You know, and I guess it would be

335
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:13,000
正是他这个年龄孩子的共性
natural for him to wonder.

336
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:14,033
我想他可能只是想知道
I mean, he's probably just wondering, you know,

337
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:17,036
-到底发生了些什么  -玛丽
- what is it that could have gone so wrong.  - Marie.

338
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,033
-致使父母离异  -玛丽
- that my mother would leave  - Marie.

339
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,070
斯凯勒  如果你不跟我讲清楚
I can't help you get through this, Skyler,

340
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,094
沃尔特到底做了些什么
you know, if you won't tell me

341
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:25,087
-我无法帮到你的  - 你知道吗
- what it is that Walt did. - Well, you know what?

342
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:28,061
我不记得曾向你寻求过帮助吧
I don't-- I don't remember asking you, all right?

343
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,035
-我觉得这正是  -如果你真的想帮我
- Well, I think that's... - So if you want to be supportive,

344
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:31,020
你现在发愁的原因
the reason you're stuck.

345
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,048
求求你就别这么八卦了
You could be supportive without prying,

346
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:34,032
-那样会更好些  - 八卦  好吧
- that would be really great  - Prying, okay.

347
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:37,005
八卦这个词很贴切  我确实
Well, prying's a strong word, but I don't--

348
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:38,026
是在帮倒忙
...helpful.

349
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:47,000
你们脑海中
It's that...

350
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:48,066
回荡的声响
voice inside your head.

351
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:54,040
反反复复  一刻不停  让人抓狂
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.

352
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:57,094
你们知道我说的是什么吧
You guys know what I'm talking about.

353
00:27:57,097 --> 00:28:01,024
那个嘲讽你无能的声响
That voice that tells you you're not good enough.

354
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:04,098
到底什么无能
Not good enough for what? Not good enough to...

355
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:06,095
是不够格当美国总统吗
be what, President of the United States?

356
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:10,086
好吧  也许扯得太远了
Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.

357
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:14,026
但现在你们是否有
But now are you good enough

358
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:17,076
与人分享喜怒哀乐的资格呢
to deserve your share of basic human happiness?

359
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,040
你们是否对自己的状况
Are you good enough to be okay

360
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:22,087
感到满意呢
with who and what you are?

361
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,073
我想答案是肯定的
I say yes.

362
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:31,064
但是不要管我说了什么
But it doesn't matter what I say.

363
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:33,031
那是你们脑海中的声音
It's your voice,

364
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:35,028
只有你自己能听得到
which means you're the only one that hears it,

365
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:37,091
只有你自己才能与之斗争
which means that you're the only one that can fight it.

366
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:38,074
对吧
Right?

367
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,079
杰西
Jesse...

368
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:43,015
从来没听你讲过话
We never hear from you.

369
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:45,069
到底怎么了
What's going on?

370
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:47,056
如果你认为我讲的全是废话
You can tell me I'm full of shit.

371
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,053
没事  我不介意
It's okay. I don't mind.

372
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:51,056
但是...说吧
Just... Come on.

373
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,080
给我们讲一讲
Let us in on it.

374
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,097
要说什么  你当然什么都懂
So, like, what makes you the expert?

375
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:07,008
我好像从来没这么说过
I don't think I ever said I was that.

376
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,068
是啊  但是坐在那里讲话的人是你吧
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?

377
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:12,055
对我们说这讲那
Telling us thus and so,

378
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:16,069
要学会快乐生活  要宽恕自己云云
be happy, forgive yourself, blah, blah, blah.

379
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:19,066
但是你伤害过人吗
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

380
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:24,059
我不是指让你母亲失望之类的事
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever,

381
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:28,003
但是...
but did you...

382
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:30,020
你是否真的
ever really...

383
00:29:30,023 --> 00:29:31,070
伤害过别人
hurt someone?

384
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:36,014
我害死了自己的女儿
I killed my daughter.

385
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:45,075
那天是7月18日
It was July 18th...

386
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:48,012
那是我的生日
Which is my birthday.

387
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:52,002
1992年的7月18日
July 18, 1992.

388
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:54,086
我吸食了大量的可卡因
I was high on cocaine,

389
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:55,099
还喝了很多酒
and I was drunk.

390
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,076
可卡因不是诱因
Cocaine wasn't an issue

391
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,026
因为之前那晚
because I had bought myself 2 grams

392
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,036
我买了2克的可卡因当做自己的生日礼物
the night before as a birthday present.

393
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,056
那晚我还剩好多
I had plenty left.

394
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,033
但我喝了太多的伏特加
But I was out of vodka.

395
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,037
这一切都发生在弗吉尼亚的朴茨茅斯
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia,

396
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,048
那地方的超市里不卖酒
Where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets,

397
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:12,045
但ABC百货里有卖
they have these ABC stores

398
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:14,049
可是他们五点就会打烊
Which close at 5 p.m.

399
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:18,019
那时大概四点四十二分
And right then it was, like, 4:42.

400
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:23,007
我在跟我妻子争吵
So I'm arguing with my wife--

401
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,043
"求你了 帮我去一趟ABC吧"
"Come on, go to the ABC for me."

402
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:27,007
"今天是我的生日啊 "
"It's my birthday."

403
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,014
"快点"
"Come on."

404
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:31,014
"他们不会卖酒给我的"
"They're not gonna sell it to me."

405
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,032
她说"不去 不去"
She's saying, "No, no."

406
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:38,099
我就很生气  时间不多了
So I'm pissed, and the clock is ticking,

407
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:40,089
我就跳上车
so I jump in my truck.

408
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:43,053
她
She's--

409
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:45,016
我6岁的女儿
my 6-year-old daughter...

410
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:49,036
她在车道末端玩耍
She's playing at the end of the driveway.

411
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:52,067
于是
So...

412
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,058
你怎么不恨你自己呢
How do you not hate yourself?

413
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:06,061
我确实很恨我自己  恨了很长时间
I did hate myself... for a long time.

414
00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:09,067
但这并没有阻止我
But it didn't stop me from...

415
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,029
继续酗酒  继续吸毒
drinking and getting high.

416
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:14,019
这只让事情变得更糟
It just made it that much worse.

417
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:19,029
自我憎恶  罪恶感
Self-hatred, guilt,

418
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,066
这些成就不了任何事情
It accomplishes nothing.

419
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,087
它们只能阻碍你
It just stands in the way.

420
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,003
阻碍你什么呢
Stands in the way of what?

421
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:29,057
真正的改变
True change.

422
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:02,094
斯凯勒
Skyler, hi.

423
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:04,060
现在方便谈谈么
Is this a good time to talk?

424
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,064
当然  请进
Yeah. Come in, please.

425
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,058
斯凯勒
Skyler.

426
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,084
你想开始说吗
Do you want to start?

427
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:49,031
好的
Okay.

428
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:13,097
为什么你会想出这种方式
Why are you even thinking this way?

429
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,038
是为了惩罚我吗
Is it to punish me?

430
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,037
沃尔特  我不是惩罚你
I am not punishing you, Walt.

431
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:22,035
这就是在惩罚我
This is punitive is what this is.

432
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:23,075
我们的婚姻很美满
We are happily married.

433
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:25,095
我婚后很幸福
I am happily married.

434
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:27,035
我很开心
I am happy.

435
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,059
我们只是
We're just--

436
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:39,000
斯凯勒  我爱你
I love you, Skyler,

437
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:41,097
我愿意为你做任何事
And I would do anything for you.

438
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:47,000
你可不可以考虑
Would you even consider--

439
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:49,084
我的意思是 天呐
I mean, Jesus!

440
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:51,004
你来我这儿
You come in here,

441
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:53,051
你把这些纸甩到我面前
And you wave these papers in my face,

442
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:58,002
这件事有着完整的两面
When there's a whole other entire side to this thing.

443
00:33:58,055 --> 00:34:00,057
一面是你  一面是我
There's your side, and there's my side.

444
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:02,095
而你还没有听过我的解释
And you haven't heard my side yet.

445
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:04,052
你甚至还什么都不知道
You haven't heard any of it at all.

446
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:05,092
你是个毒品贩子
You're a drug dealer.

447
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:12,036
不是  什么  你怎么
No. What-- How--

448
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,053
什么
What?

449
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:25,024
是的
Yeah.

450
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:30,085
不然的话怎么解释你会赚那么多钱
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?

451
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:36,079
大麻
Marijuana.

452
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:39,092
那个叫平克曼的孩子
That Pinkman kid.

453
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,040
不是吗
No?

454
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:54,021
哦  我的天呐  沃尔特
Walt Oh, my God, Walt.

455
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:58,094
可卡因
Cocaine?

456
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:04,078
是甲基苯丙胺
It's methamphetamine.

457
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:04,078
甲基苯丙胺:  一种中枢兴奋药

458
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,025
但我  我是
But I-- I'm--

459
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,062
我制造
I manufacture.

460
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,012
但我不贩卖
I am not a dealer.

461
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,053
哦
Oh.

462
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:16,043
这东西本身
Per se.

463
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:18,093
它并不意味...
It doesn't mean--

464
00:35:18,097 --> 00:35:20,037
斯凯勒  别这样
No, Skyler.

465
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,083
-斯凯勒 听我说  -不
- Listen to me, Skyler. - No.

466
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:23,057
-听着 -不
- Listen. - No.

467
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,037
这事有很多层面
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?

468
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,055
这很复杂  你明白吗  所以请你
It's complicated, all right? So please, let's--

469
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:30,010
求你了 我们坐回去
Please, let's just sit back down,

470
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,084
我们好好谈谈
and we'll talk it through.

471
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:35,011
沃尔特  我要跟你做笔交易
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

472
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:36,095
我不会告诉汉克
I won't tell Hank,

473
00:35:36,098 --> 00:35:40,018
我也不会告诉孩子们或任何人
And I won't tell your children or anybody else.

474
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:42,021
我不会走漏一丝风声
Nobody will hear it from me,

475
00:35:42,025 --> 00:35:44,052
但你要答应我离婚
But only if you grant me this divorce

476
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:45,090
并且离我们的生活远远的
and stay out of our lives.

477
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,069
-斯凯勒别这样  -我是认真的
- No, Skyler. - I mean it.

478
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,099
我要赶紧离开这鬼地方  我快吐了
Now let me the hell out of here before I throw up.

479
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,039
你的挡风玻璃碎了
Your windshield's broken.

480
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:34,080
没错
Yep.

481
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:45,021
我的婚姻正经历一些小挫折
A little friction in the marriage right now.

482
00:36:45,024 --> 00:36:46,077
非常短暂的
Strictly temporary.

483
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,038
我们只是
We're just--

484
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,091
只是需要一些空间
Just taking a little break.

485
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:54,052
你睡那儿吧
Uh, that's you over there.

486
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:59,046
听好了  关于钱的事
Listen, um, money.

487
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:02,039
索尔正替你看着呢
Saul has got it for you,

488
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:04,016
只要你感觉好点儿了
And so as so as you're feeling better--

489
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,033
我很好
I'm better.

490
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:08,063
你很好
You're better.

491
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,044
真的吗
Really?

492
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:13,044
什么  那个康复中心  有用吗
What? The rehab? It helped?

493
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:15,084
恩  我戒掉了
Yeah. I'm done using.

494
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:20,078
真是太棒了  真是
That's excellent. That's--

495
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,062
很好  杰西
That's very good, Jesse.

496
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:25,092
孩子  很好
Boy-- very good.

497
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:29,072
你知道...
You know, um...

498
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:34,036
不管遇到多么糟糕的情况
in spite of how bad things got,

499
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,097
可以把它当做
it really could be looked at

500
00:37:36,097 --> 00:37:38,084
对我们的当头棒喝
like a wake-up call for both of us.

501
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:42,064
我是说  让我们...
I mean, you know, just to get our--

502
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:44,021
让我们的生活回到原轨
our lives back together again

503
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:47,003
循规蹈矩  安分守己
and on the straight and narrow.

504
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:53,085
你一直在调查飞机失事的事
You been following this airplane crash?

505
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,039
是啊
Yeah.

506
00:37:57,042 --> 00:38:00,029
你知道是珍妮的父亲
You know it was Jane's dad

507
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:02,006
是他不经意间让飞机相撞的
who accidentally crashed them together?

508
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,029
是因为他身心俱惫么
Because he was so torn up?

509
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,039
好的  听着  我要打断一下  好吗
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?

510
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,063
你跟这事没关系
You are not responsible for this--

511
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:13,073
一点关系都没有  好吗
not in any way, shape, or form, all right?

512
00:38:13,077 --> 00:38:16,037
我...我一直在追踪这件事
Now, I-- I am very up-to-date on this thing,

513
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,070
也许比你知道的更多
probably far more than you are,

514
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:22,040
在这件事中有很多不确定因素
and there are-- there are many factors at play there.

515
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:23,016
是吗
Yeah?

516
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:25,000
比如
For instance,

517
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:28,084
也许飞机的防撞雷达
there's some sort of collision radar

518
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:31,070
失灵了
on the jet that may not have been working properly.

519
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:33,064
这都在公务档案上  你可以查阅一下
Now, that's public record. You can look that up.

520
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:37,018
整个系统 用的是上世纪60年代的技术
And the whole system is run on-- on 1960s technology.

521
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:39,044
不
No.

522
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:41,084
不  说真的...
No, really...

523
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,017
我怪罪于政府
I blame the government.

524
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:48,001
要不逃避
You either run from things,

525
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:50,078
要不就面对  怀特老师
or you face them, Mr. White.

526
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:53,064
什么意思
And what exactly does that mean?

527
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:54,088
我在康复中心学到的
I learned it in rehab.

528
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:59,002
接受最真实的自我
It's all about accepting who you really are.

529
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,075
我接受我是谁
I accept who I am.

530
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,022
那么你是谁呢
And who are you?

531
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,049
我是坏蛋
I'm the bad guy.

532
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,054
您吃得还满意吗
Is the food to your satisfaction?

533
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:37,061
很棒
Very much.

534
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:39,055
很高兴再次见到您
It's good to see you again.

535
00:39:43,072 --> 00:39:44,072
我可以坐吗
May I?

536
00:39:51,046 --> 00:39:54,069
有个提议我想你会感兴趣的
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.

537
00:39:57,006 --> 00:40:00,080
实际上我到这儿来不是
I actually am not here to--

538
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,098
我来是因为
I'm here because

539
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:09,087
出于礼貌和对您的尊重
I owe you the courtesy and respect

540
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:11,084
我必须来当面讲明
to tell you this personally.

541
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,048
我要收手了
I'm done.

542
00:40:18,055 --> 00:40:20,088
这个决定和您个人没有任何关系
It has nothing to do with you personally.

543
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:25,019
我觉得您相当的专业
I find you extraordinarily professional,

544
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,039
而且我很欣赏您做生意的方式
and I appreciate the way you do business.

545
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:30,056
我只是想
I'm just...

546
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,046
让我的生活有所改变
making a change in my life

547
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:35,063
并且  我...
is what it is, and I'm--

548
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:39,023
我在十字路口彷徨  举足无措
I'm at some-- something of a crossroads.

549
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:43,063
渐渐的我意识到
It has brought me to a realization.

550
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,090
我不是罪犯
I am not a criminal.

551
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,051
亦无意冒犯那些罪犯们
No offense to any people who are.

552
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:56,094
但是
But...

553
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,005
我不是那种人
This is not me.

554
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,068
尽管如此  我想让你听听我的提议
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.

555
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:10,092
我不会改变主意的  对不起
It won't change my mind. I'm sorry.

556
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:13,029
三百万美元
$3 million.

557
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:15,036
给你三个月的时间
For three months of your time.

558
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:20,073
三个月  然后退出
Three months, then out.

559
00:41:27,037 --> 00:41:28,050
三百万么
3 million?

560
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,077
我可以把它当做一个肯定的回答吗
May I take this as a yes?

561
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:45,011
我有钱
I have money.

562
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:47,052
我钱多的都不知道怎么花
