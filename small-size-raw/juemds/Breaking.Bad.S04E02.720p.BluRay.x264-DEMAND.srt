1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,150
怎么样  看起来如何
So? How does it look?

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,860
你想问 我能不能看到它
You mean, in do I see it?

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,460
是的
Yes.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,470
你看到了吗
Do you see it?

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,680
基本上  是个有脑子的警察
Basically, any lawman worth his salt's

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,510
都能看出来你带了家伙
going to spot that, yeah.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,840
看来这玩意容易坏事
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,810
对  容易坏事
Yes. It's a deal breaker.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,500
如果你希望低调一些
Well, if stealth is what you're aspiring to,

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,160
最好带一个小一点的
you best go with something more compact--

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,030
点38特别版
.38 Special,

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,370
短鼻子
snub nose.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,430
隐形撞针
Got a concealed hammer

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,970
拔枪时不会挂住你的腰带
so it doesn't catch on your belt when you draw.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,300
屡试不爽  口碑极佳
Tried and true, no nonsense about it.

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,110
-5发子弹  -对
- Five shots? - Yep.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,040
自动手枪有多少发
Automatic has how many?

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,710
弹匣里10发  枪膛里一发
Ten in the mag, one in the chamber.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,580
如果你5发之内解决不了
If you can't get it done with five,

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,160
那就证明你根本不会瞄准
then you're into spraying prey,

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,520
那种情形  多给你6发子弹也没什么用
in which case I wouldn't count on another six closing the deal.

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,500
这枪装的是10克重的空尖弹
You load that with 158 grain hollow points

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,040
而不是普通的冲孔弹
instead of your standard wad cutters.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,250
杀伤力足够大
It's got plenty of stopping power.

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,000
左轮手枪是最应手的家伙
Can't get more dependable than a wheel gun.

26
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,900
这个
Here. Um...

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
把它装里边试试
Try it on with this.

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,960
如果你想把它别在腰上
That snub, you'll conceal real nice

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,650
用这个枪套很适合
if you carry it I-W-B.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,750
拔枪会困难一些
Little harder to draw from,

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,620
但如果你不想被
but there's really no substitute

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,590
警惕的人察觉  真没有别的办法
if you're intent of fooling a vigilant eye.

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,420
还有塑料的
Comes in polymer, too.

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,030
我更喜欢皮革的感觉
I prefer the feel of leather.

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,900
有点传统的感觉
Old school, I guess.

36
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,370
是啊
Yeah, um...

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,000
放在这边真的没错吗
You sure it's on the correct side?

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,940
如果你不是左撇子  就没错
If you're right-handed, it is.

39
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,780
不知道  你确定吗
I don't know, ma-- Are you sure

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,510
因为我感觉放在左边感觉好一些
because maybe it'll feel better on the left side.

41
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,180
一般规律  不能从身体另一侧拔枪
General rule-- You don't want to cross draw,

42
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,550
除非你坐在椅子上
not unless you're going to be sitting,

43
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,350
比如商店职员  赌博的人什么的
you know, store clerks, card gamers and such.

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,820
无论怎么样  你都要不停的练习拔枪
Either way you're going to want to practice your draw...

45
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,630
多加练习
a lot...

46
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,900
因为如果你笨手笨脚
because if you're all fingers,

47
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,830
笑到最后的人
well, it might could be him

48
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,690
可能是他  而不是你
keeping a piece instead of you.

49
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,940
明白我的意思吗
Catch my drift?

50
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,640
这是什么
What's this?

51
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,340
这就是你要花比枪支商店
That there is why you're going to pay me five times

52
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,520
高五倍的价钱买它的原因
what you'd pay your neighborhood gun store.

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,920
枪号被擦掉了
Serial number has been filed off.

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,560
所以说
So...

55
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,090
明摆着的事
to state the obvious,

56
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,900
我不想因为这把枪被抓住
I don't want to be caught with this on me.

57
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,500
是啊  先生  明摆着的事
No, sir, to state the obvious, you don't.

58
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,850
先生  我从事这样的生意
You know, Mister, I've been providing my services

59
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,600
已经30多年了
for the past 30-odd years.

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,870
这段时间里
You'd think in that time

61
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,840
我明白  最好不要过问别人的生意
I'd learn better than to ask a man his business,

62
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,240
尤其是那律师介绍的人
especially about one referred by the lawyer,

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,050
但我真的很想问问你
but I do feel the urge to ask you,

64
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,280
你买枪真是为了防身吗
we strictly talking defense here?

65
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:21,286
对  绝对是防身用
Yes, absolutely defense.

66
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,090
怎么了
Why?

67
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,220
如果你只是为了保护自己
Because if it's just personal protection,

68
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,160
不如去通过合法途径买枪
aside from a bucket of money,

69
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,130
这样不仅可以省下好多钱
you'd save yourself a potential felony two-spot

70
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,330
也不会因为携带无序列号的枪支
for carrying a weapon with a defaced serial number

71
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,170
而被判重罪
if you'd just buy it legally.

72
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,370
是啊  但是
Yeah, but...

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,870
如果你真要用它的话
if you did have to use it,

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,970
用一把查不到来历的枪难道不是更好吗
wouldn't it still be better to use one that couldn't be traced?

75
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,900
老大  这里是西部
This is the west, boss.

76
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,380
新墨西哥州不是个文明的地方
New Mexico's not a retreat jurisdiction.

77
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,850
如果有人过来要伤害你的身体
Man steps to you bent on doing bodily harm,

78
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,280
你有一切权利进行反击
you've got every right to plant your feet

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,020
开枪杀死他
and shoot to kill.

80
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,620
有人称之为道德权利
Some call it a moral right,

81
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,820
我就很同意这种说法
and I do include myself within that class.

82
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,830
我要说的是
All this to say

83
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,630
我很高兴带着你的钱走人
I'm happy to take your money,

84
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,030
但如果你不是身犯重罪的人
but if you're not a convicted felon,

85
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,170
我建议你最好
you might best be advised

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
还是不要触犯法律为妙
to bear your arms within the confines of the law.

87
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,080
这是防身用的
It's for defense.

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,550
防身
Defense.

89
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,361
我要了
I'll take it.

90
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,460
第四季 第二集
S04E02: Thirty-Eight Snub

91
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,120
多谢  邦妮
Thanks, Bonnie.

92
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,410
杰西
Jesse.

93
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,700
你好啊  哥们
What's up, brother?

94
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,600
老兄  里面像是地震了
Dude, it sounds like an earthquake out there.

95
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,600
对  买了新的音响设备
Yeah. New sound system.

96
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,830
来瞧瞧
Whoa! Check it out.

97
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,170
好震撼的低音炮  你可以啊
Bodacious subwoofers, yo!

98
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,070
这可是真家伙
Serious cannons.

99
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,480
有六个口径十八英寸的炮
18-inchers, six of them.

100
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,530
铝制炮管
Aluminum columns

101
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,150
所以声音非常适中
so they're really, really like, uh, sonically neutral.

102
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,580
扬声器也很无敌
Tweeters are killers, too.

103
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,980
我喜欢那些线条蹦来蹦去
Dig all them lines jumping around.

104
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,180
太迷幻了
Psychedelic.

105
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,820
我现在只想盯着它们看
Kind of like just want to stare at them.

106
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,260
没错  伙计
Hmm. Yeah, man.

107
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,690
完全让我想把旧音响砸了
Totally makes me want to crank old Savage

108
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,380
搞台炫的
and blaze one.

109
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,270
这机器有参数均衡功能
It's got, like, parametric equalization.

110
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,970
能自动随着气压等外部条件
Automatically adjusts the levels

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,340
的变化调节音阶
to changes in, like, air pressure and whatnot.

112
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,820
这完全是数字真空管扩音器
It's a totally digital vacuum tube amp

113
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,670
是迄今为止最好的保真扩音器
which is by far the best anti-distortion-wise.

114
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,240
轻而易举就能达到120分贝
It's 120 decibels without breaking a sweat.

115
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,580
站稳了  伙计们
Hold on to your hats, bitches.

116
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,170
对了  伙计  我昨天聚会看到安德里亚了
Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting yesterday.

117
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,900
她还问起你了
She asked about you.

118
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,790
谢了  不过..
Thanks, man, but, uh...

119
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,560
我们在戒毒
12 steps and all that.

120
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,030
不是吧
Seriously?

121
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,950
只吸一小口吧
Maybe just a little bump.

122
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,120
《求生之路》  赞
Left 4 Dead, yo,

123
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,590
僵尸吃了那么多人
the way them bitches get all cranial

124
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,470
当你把它一枪爆头的时候
when you cap them in the head.

125
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,790
爽死了
It's like booyah!

126
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,830
不不不  兄弟
No, no, no, man.

127
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,150
《生化危机4》绝对胜出
Resident Evil 4 takes it by a long shot.

128
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,700
拜托  兄弟  你是在打广告吗
Aw, please, brother, you're fronting.

129
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,800
不  伙计  说真的
No, man, seriously.

130
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,870
那妞  就是你得去解救的那个
That chick, the one you got to rescue,

131
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,440
惹火极了  兄弟
she's smokin', bro,

132
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,040
然后你就像是世上仅有的男人
and then you're, like, the last undead dude on earth,

133
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,880
你怎么能没兴趣呢
so how can you not be dipping into that?

134
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,750
这才是激励男人打僵尸的动力啊
Talk about inspiring a brother to kick some zombie ass!

135
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,080
僵尸要吃你脑子
They're trying to eat your brain, bro.

136
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,320
你还需要啥动力
A dude don't need no more motivation.

137
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,020
我觉得很中肯
That's a fair point, I guess.

138
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,120
好  好  好
Okay. Okay. Okay.

139
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,060
《使命的召唤之战火世界》    僵尸模式
Call of Duty, World at War-- Zombie mode.

140
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,090
那才刺激
Now, that's the bomb, man.

141
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,260
好好想想
Think on it, bro.

142
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,860
他们不仅仅是僵尸
They're not just zombies.

143
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,600
他们是纳粹僵尸
They're Nazi zombies.

144
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,100
纳粹僵尸
Nazi zombies.

145
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,570
对  也是纳粹党卫队的骑兵
Yeah, man. S.S. Waffen troopers, too,

146
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,560
是整个纳粹家族最坏的纳粹分子
which are, like, the baddest ass Nazis of the whole Nazi family!

147
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,010
僵尸都死了  伙计
Zombies are dead, man.

148
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,320
他们活着的时候是干什么的
What difference does it make

149
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,840
又有什么重要
what their job was when they was living?

150
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,980
老兄  你真是出土文物
Dude, you are so historically retarded.

151
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,550
纳粹僵尸不想吃你
Nazi zombies don't want to eat you

152
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,650
只是因为他们渴望补充蛋白质
just because they're craving the protein.

153
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,220
他们这样是因为
They do it because--

154
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,490
因为他们恨美国人
They do it because they hate Americans, man.

155
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,630
塔利班  他们是僵尸世界的
Talibans-- They're the Talibans

156
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,290
塔利班分子
of the zombie world.

157
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,500
我打过这个游戏
I played the game, bro.

158
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,760
他们并不是健步如飞
They ain't exactly fleet of foot.

159
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,360
我是说  有什么难打的
Ohh! I'm saying where's the challenge?

160
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
至少《求生之路》里的僵尸
At least the zombies in Left 4 Dead

161
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,670
跑得飞快
clock a respectable 40.

162
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,960
你得引诱包抄
You got to lead them and shit.

163
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,540
老兄  那是因为他们根本不是僵尸
Dude, that's because they're not even zombies!

164
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,840
他们只是被传染了
They're just infected.

165
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,210
他们染上了这种流行病
They got, like, this rage virus.

166
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,780
能量大增  像是打了鸡血似的
Amps them up like they've been smoking the schwag!

167
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,510
风马牛不相干
Apples and oranges, bro.

168
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,680
完全不能相提并论
Totally unfair to compare the two.

169
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,520
杰西
Yo, Jesse,

170
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,910
你的结论是什么
where do you come out on all this?

171
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,530
完全同意
Agree, totally.

172
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,210
刚才是我的幻觉吗
Did that just happen?

173
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,750
该死
Damn, man.

174
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,510
太安静了
It's quiet.

175
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,520
你们知道这里该来点什么吗
You know what this-- This place needs?

176
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,570
你没事吧
You okay?

177
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,470
没事
Fine.

178
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,340
你睡不着吗
Can't you sleep?

179
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,580
实际上不是  玛丽  我在睡觉
Actually, yes, Marie. This is me sleeping.

180
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,480
怎么回事
What's it look like?

181
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,350
你像是在看一块石头
Looks like you're looking at a rock

182
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,270
半夜12点了
24 in the morning.

183
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,050
这不是块石头  是块矿石
This is not a rock. This is a mineral,

184
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,920
我都说了不下十遍了
for, like, the tenth time.

185
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,790
好  知道了
Okay. Got it.

186
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,530
确切点说  是蓝色金刚砂
Blue corundum, to be precise.

187
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,870
蓝色金刚砂  很好看
Blue corundum. Well, it's very pretty.

188
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,500
镶以岩火烧成的母片岩中的
It's encrusted with igneous biotite

189
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,870
黑云母
in a mica schist.

190
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,560
你想了解更多吗  我可什么都知道
Would you like some more detail? Because I can give it to you.

191
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,610
你就这么一直假装对我的事感兴趣
You keep acting like you give the first shit,

192
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,850
-而我...  -汉克
- and I'll-- - Hank.

193
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,020
这是在伊里安查亚的中科迪勒拉山}发现的
Found in the Central Cordillera of Irian Jaya.

194
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,320
蓝色刚玉
Blue corundum.

195
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,330
我只是想说
I'm just saying...

196
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,330
现在是凌晨两点
it's 2 in the morning.

197
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,100
我只是想问  要是你能
I'm just...asking if maybe--

198
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,530
玛丽  就我所知
You know, when last I counted, Marie,

199
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,170
这房子里有4间卧室
there were four bedrooms in this house.

200
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,110
你懂我的意思  要是我打扰到你的话
You know, I mean, if I'm keeping you awake and all that.

201
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,490
我是沃尔特・怀特
You have reached Walter White.

202
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,560
请听到嘀声后  留下你的姓名和电话
At the tone, please state your name, number,

203
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,290
和你打来的原因
and the reason for your call.

204
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,300
谢谢配合
Thank you.

205
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,600
沃尔特
Walt?

206
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,400
在吗  沃尔特
Hello? Walt?

207
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,800
好吧  沃尔特  你能...
Um, okay, Walt, could you, uh,

208
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,520
你能回我个电话吗  求你了
could you call me back, please?

209
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,110
汉克的医药费账单都堆积成山了
Hank's bills are really starting to pile up here,

210
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,910
还有就是
and, uh, in the meantime,

211
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,840
你很久都没给过我支票了
I haven't received a check from you in quite a while,

212
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,910
就是这事
so there's that.

213
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,180
还有一件事就是
Uh, second order of business

214
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,350
洗车房的事
is, uh, is the car wash.

215
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,448
-日 -我们得为下一步考虑
- God! - Take the next step here.

216
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,420
我们需要买下这间洗车房
We need to look into buying this car wash

217
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,420
用以处理...
while we still have--

218
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,320
斯凯勒  你在做什么
Skyler. What are you doing?

219
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,460
你什么意思
What do you mean?

220
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,530
等等  你是不是一直以来都无视我的来电
Wait. Are you screening all my calls?

221
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,500
没  没有  我只是
No. No. No. I just--

222
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,100
你是怎么想的
What are you thinking,

223
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,070
居然在我电话录音上留下这样一条信息
leaving a message like that on my machine?

224
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,840
我说了什么
What are you-- What did I say?

225
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,676
就在刚才  你留下了一个关于
You just left recorded proof

226
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:48,950
购买一间洗车房的录音证据
of our intention to buy a car wash.

227
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,110
你觉得这样做明智吗
Now you think that was wise?

228
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,740
关于我们什么的证据
Proof of our what?

229
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,280
你在说些什么东西
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,420
斯凯勒  我们不该在这段时间里
Skyler, we should not even be mentioning the words

231
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,120
在电话里提及任何有关洗车房的词
"Car wash" on the phone at all, period.

232
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,290
沃尔特  这只是个洗车房  不是妓院
Walt, it is a car wash, not a brothel.

233
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,130
我是说  要是我们都不能说它
I mean, if we can't even say what it is,

234
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,600
那有何必去买它
why are we buying it at all?

235
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,360
天哪  听着  斯凯勒  求你了
God, look, Skyler, please, just--

236
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,470
-早安  妈妈  -早安  亲爱的
- Hey, Mom. - Hey, hon.

237
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,900
桌子上有麦片粥
Look, there's some cereal on the breakfast table.

238
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,810
听我说
I'm telling you,

239
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,210
要是你不想这么做的话
if you're not willing to pull the trigger on this,

240
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,510
那我就自己去找古德曼
I am more than happy to call Goodman myself.

241
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,850
别  别  别  我会处理好的
No, no, no, no, no. I will handle it, okay?

242
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,920
我脑袋都要炸了
I could so use a brain transplant right now.

243
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,290
听着  我要去上班了
Hey, uh, I'm going to work.

244
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,860
起床了  蠢货
Wake up, bitch.

245
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,230
他妈的
Damn!

246
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,000
老兄  你的菊花也太敏感了点吧
You're way too sensitive about your zone, bro.

247
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,640
该醒了  老兄  打扫时间到
Ohh. Come on, man. Clean-up time.

248
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,300
立马起身  至少这我们还能做
Right on. Least we can do.

249
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,540
别管什么打扫了
Hey. The hell with, uh, with cleaning up.

250
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,650
给大伙带点早饭回来
Just go out and get everybody some breakfast.

251
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,510
顺便再去买点酒来
Stock up on liquor while you're at it.

252
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,520
派对永不结束
Keep this party going.

253
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,763
说真的我
I mean it, yo.

254
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,659
我希望我回来的时候
I want this place kicking harder

255
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,590
派对能更加疯狂
than a Sensei when I get back.

256
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,620
没问题
All right.

257
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,260
包在我们身上  兄弟
You got it, bro.

258
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,500
都他妈的给我动起来
Come on, damn it.

259
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,060
醒来继续派对
Wake up and party!

260
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,920
你好
Hello.

261
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,470
你是新派来的
Yo, you the new guy?

262
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,770
没错
Yeah.

263
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,570
都做好了吗
You got something for me?

264
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,280
201.6磅[约180斤]
201.6.

265
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,780
多少重来着
What's the count?

266
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,020
201.6磅
201.6.

267
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,260
麻烦你再称一下
Give it a second weigh if you would, please.

268
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,060
新政策
New policy.

269
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,300
怎么了  沃尔特
What, Walter?

270
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
古斯在哪
Where's Gus?

271
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,430
问他干吗
Why?

272
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,290
因为我想和他说几句
Because I would like to speak with him.

273
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,050
因为  话还没有说清楚
Because, the way we left things,

274
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,250
我想解释下其中的误会
I-- I would like the chance to clear the air.

275
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,450
怎么
What?

276
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,160
沃尔特  你再也不能见到他了
Walter, you're never going to see him again.

277
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,590
看看谁被饿醒了
Oh, look who woke up hungry.

278
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,960
你饿吗
Are you hungry?

279
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,030
好样的  喝多点
Yeah, that's good. Drink that up.

280
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,420
再喝一点  我的宝贝
Just a little longer, okay, my sweetie?

281
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,590
好吗
Okay?

282
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,720
就这样
There you go.

283
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,350
好了
Okay, now...

284
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,790
这辆道奇车弄了个彻底清洗
the Dodge gets a detail,

285
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,320
还有
and...

286
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,830
那辆花冠来了个手工上蜡
the Corolla gets a hand wax?

287
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,670
没错  手工上蜡
Right? Hand wax.

288
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,000
没错
Okay.

289
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,420
别急哦  小宝贝
Oh. Hello. Hello.

290
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,000
再过几分钟  我们就回家
Just a few more minutes, and we're on our way home.

291
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,840
好吗  我的宝贝女儿
Okay, my sweet girl?

292
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,577
妈妈有正事要做
Mama's just doing her work here.

293
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,997
妈妈在工作
Mama's doing her work.

294
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,980
瞧瞧
Let's see.

295
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,180
做得好  汉克
Way to go, Hank.

296
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,090
加把劲
Whoa, way to soldier up.

297
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,360
你做到了
You're doing it!

298
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,890
加油
Come on!

299
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,360
还有几码而已
Another few yards.

300
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,230
该死
Damn!

301
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,070
上帝啊
Ahh, Jesus!

302
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,840
瞧瞧你自己  太棒了  宝贝
Look at you! Way to go, honey!

303
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,300
加油
Come on.

304
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,010
加油  汉克
Come on, Hank!

305
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,840
坚持下
Keep it going!

306
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,950
就差十步了
Just ten more steps.

307
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,320
九步
9!

308
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,500
八步
8.

309
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,740
七步
7!

310
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,170
六步
6!

311
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,780
就快到了  汉克
You're almost there, Hank.

312
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,895
天啊
God!

313
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,910
太好了  伙计
Oh, yeah. All right, buddy.

314
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,040
这才是我说的牛逼
That's what I call kicking some ass.

315
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,010
太棒了  宝贝
Oh, it was awesome, babe!

316
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,317
太棒了
Hell, yeah.

317
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:09,168
太漂亮了
Very nice.

318
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:10,610
好样的
Yeah!

319
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,007
来
Hey!

320
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,298
你是个好人  查克  谢谢
You're a good man, Chuck. Thanks.

321
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,374
这是我的荣幸  朋友
It's an honor, my friend.

322
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,560
明天这时候
Same time tomorrow?

323
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,430
没错  只要我还活着
Damn straight, if I'm still alive.

324
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,070
这节恢复很成功  表现很积极
Great session. Lots of positive energy.

325
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,440
相当积极
Lots.

326
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,370
看到他这样  真是太高兴了
It's just it's so great to see that.

327
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,040
只是...  没错
It's just-- Yeah.

328
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,880
一天一天慢慢来
One day at a time.

329
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,610
我们只能这样了
All we can do.

330
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,880
我知道  只是
I know. It's just

331
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,890
你跟他很合得来
you've got a real way with him.

332
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,290
真是
It's--

333
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,920
你想做全职吗
You want to go full-time?

334
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,560
我们家有空闲的卧房
We've got a spare bedroom.

335
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,390
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

336
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,940
你今天真的很坚强
You were so strong today.

337
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,780
你是不是有胃口了  我肯定你饿了
Did you work up an appetite? I'm sure that you did.

338
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,410
我正在想着今晚要做什么
Listen, I was thinking about cooking tonight.

339
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,950
-所以  -玛丽
- So-  - Marie.

340
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,080
出去吧
Get out.

341
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,010
来得正好
Oh, yo, about time.

342
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,380
我的天
Oh, my God.

343
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,020
披萨怎么回事  都没切
Yo, what's up with the pie, man? It ain't cut.

344
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,150
没错  这可是个小创举
Yeah. Right. That's the gimmick.

345
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,980
-什么创举  -这家披萨店
- What gimmick? - This place.

346
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,090
披萨从不切开
They don't cut their pizza,

347
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,820
为你省下切的钱
and they pass the savings on to you.

348
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,370
省什么钱  切个披萨能花几个钱
What savings? How much can it be to cut a damn pizza?

349
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,800
这就像是  搞民主  兄弟
Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro, you know?

350
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,080
自己砍圣诞树  自己切披萨
Cut your own Christmas tree. Cut your own pizza.

351
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,150
对啊  很民主
Yeah. It's democratic.

352
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,210
这我要怎么吃啊
What am I supposed to do with this?

353
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,480
别对它撒气
Don't sweat it, yo.

354
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,950
你有剪刀吗
You got some, like, scissors?

355
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,920
我来把它全分开
I will cut this bitch up good.

356
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,490
请进
Yo, come in!

357
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,450
去开下门吧
Hey, would you mind?

358
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,730
我假设一年能做一千万张披萨
I figure you make, like, 10 million pizzas a year.

359
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,500
每张披萨  切开花去十秒钟
Each pizza takes, like, 10 seconds to cut.

360
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,000
换算成劳动工时  就是
In man hours, that's--

361
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,340
我算不清
I don't know.

362
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,030
很久吧
A lot?

363
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,480
杰西
Hey, Jesse.

364
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,810
找你的
You got, um, yeah.

365
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,040
你还好吗
So, uh, how you doing?

366
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,010
还在适应
I'm dealing.

367
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,114
布洛克怎么样了
How's Brock?

368
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:17,940
很好  他就在...
Good. He's...

369
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,946
布洛克  宝贝  在车里等好吗
Brock, honey, wait in the car, okay?

370
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:24,560
让大人聊一会儿
Let the grownups speak.

371
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,920
去吧  小家伙  我们一会儿聊
Go on, little man. We'll catch up later.

372
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,800
我想你知道我一直在打给你
Guess you know I've been calling.

373
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,500
是啊  我工作真的很忙
Yeah, um, I'm really busy at work and--

374
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,210
杰西  我来这儿不是来听你找借口的
Jesse, I'm not here to make you come up with excuses.

375
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,410
你有自己的事情
You got other things going on.

376
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,380
我明白
I get it.

377
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,120
只是有件事我们必须聊聊
There's just one thing you and me got to talk about.

378
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,460
就是这个
And that's this.

379
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,250
汤玛斯被杀之后  那个街区
After Tomás was murdered, two dudes from the block,

380
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,780
过去常跟他一起鬼混的两个人  被车撞了
a couple bangers he used to hang with, get run over,

381
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,710
其中一个头部中枪
one of them shot in the head.

382
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,530
就在当晚  我在邮箱里发现了这个
Same night, I get this in my mailbox.

383
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,240
这是你放的吗
This was you?

384
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,890
你知道吗
You know what?

385
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,014
无论你和杀我弟弟的凶手有什么关系
Whatever it is you had to do with my brother's killers,

386
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:31,830
我都不想知道
I don't want to know.

387
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,270
但你必须告诉我一件事
But you got to tell me one thing.

388
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,870
会有人来要这笔钱吗
Is someone gonna come looking for this?

389
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,140
不会
No.

390
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,450
那我拿这些钱来做什么
What exactly am I supposed to do with this?

391
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,430
这些钱能让你和布洛克
Use it to get you and Brock

392
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,590
搬离那个恶臭的贫民窟
out of that shit hole of a neighborhood.

393
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,377
或者拿着这些钱继续吸
Or you can go out and spend it on glass,

394
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:01,590
这我就管不了你了
and I'd have no way of stopping you.

395
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,560
但我相信你绝对不会这么做
But I got to believe you won't do that.

396
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,670
沃尔特  回家去吧
Go home, Walter.

397
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,000
您好
How you doing?

398
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,130
砖块
Ton of bricks?

399
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,960
石头
Rocks.

400
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,900
我可以帮你把它们推进去
You, uh, want me to wheel them inside for you?

401
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,130
谢谢你
Thank you.

402
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,980
玛丽  是我的矿石到了吗
Marie, is that my minerals?

403
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,580
是的  汉克
Yes, Hank.

404
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,750
有多少盒
How many boxes?

405
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,050
我不确定
I don't know--

406
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,980
三个  四个  上百个
Three, four, a hundred,

407
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,050
百万个
a million.

408
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,320
我不知道
I don't know.

409
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,950
你检查过破损吗
Did you check them for damage?

410
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,530
汉克  这些是石头
They're rocks, Hank.

411
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,630
不是  它们是矿石
No, they're minerals.

412
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,320
玛丽  这里有一些特别精美易碎的
Jesus, Marie, I got some geodes coming

413
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,770
晶洞玉石
that are very delicate, all right?

414
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,230
如果包装有破损  我就要退货
And I will not accept any boxes that have damage.

415
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,930
我跟你讲  那些送货的混蛋
Those delivery jackoffs, I'm telling you--

416
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,240
我可不能就这么受他们欺负
I'm not getting ass raped by those bastards, all right?

417
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,470
亲爱的
Just--

418
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,240
求你  能检查一下吗
Honey, would you check?

419
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,180
求你检查一下
Just check, please?

420
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,380
别那么浪费
Stop wasting it.

421
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,130
听着  告诉你哥哥
Look, tell your brother

422
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,860
如果他明天还不来上班
that if he doesn't show up tomorrow,

423
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,160
以后就别来了
I'm going to have to fire him.

424
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,940
回去干活  别那么多借口
So now go back. And no more excuses.

425
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,390
沃利兹先生  我叫斯凯勒・怀特
Mr. Wolynetz, my name is Skyler White.

426
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,200
您好
How do you do?

427
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,380
你想买我的洗车场
You want to buy my car wash.

428
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,270
是的  而且如果您愿意的话
I do. And I am prepared to talk numbers right now,

429
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,860
我今天是来跟你谈价钱的
if you'd like.

430
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,720
你以为这是份清闲的活儿吗
Do you think this is an easy job?

431
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,650
你愿意哈下腰
You are willing to get down on your hands and knees

432
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,420
蹭这擦那像个女佣一样
and scrub like a house maid

433
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,330
更何况那些化学品会灼伤你的肌肤
with all the chemicals eating into your nice skin

434
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,080
会刺痛你的双眼
and stinging in your eyes?

435
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,540
我对洗车行业有些许了解
Well, I know a thing or two about scrubbing.

436
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,140
还有其他建议吗
Any other advice for me?

437
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,010
因为我是很认真地在考虑这件事情
Because I am serious about this.

438
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,370
很好
Good.

439
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,840
我也很认真
I am serious, too.

440
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,870
我在这行辛辛苦苦白手起家
I have worked 30 years of building this business from nothing,

441
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,410
30年才建造了这家洗车场
with my own hands and my own sweat and blood.

442
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,698
我真心敬佩您
I can appreciate that, truly.

443
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,020
考虑到这点
So, with that in mind,

444
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,590
您能给我一个具体的数字吗
is there a figure you can quote me?

445
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,470
一个能让您满意的数字
One which you think would adequately--

446
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,360
一千万
$10 million.

447
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,840
不如谈一下879,000这个数字吧
Well, let's try 879,000.

448
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,510
你怎么得出这个数字呢
Where do you come up with this number?

449
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,240
瞎编出来的数字
You pull it from your behind?

450
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,310
洗车场平日里
On a typical day,

451
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,950
每小时能洗19辆车
you manage 19 cars per hour.

452
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,320
经推断  加上手工打蜡及装饰品等
Extrapolating, I added the extra revenues

453
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,090
预算外收入
for hand waxes and detailing,

454
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,810
再减去日常开支  薪金  维修费
subtracted your overhead and salary and maintenance,

455
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,020
运转费  折旧
operating fees, depreciation,

456
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,070
我从阿尔伯开克地区相同等级品牌
which I obtained from comparable businesses

457
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,300
得到的数据
in the Albuquerque area,

458
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,160
使我大概得出你这里每年的资金流动
giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here,

459
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,110
我运用了产业标准乘数
to which I applied the industry standard multiplier

460
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,600
并加上你不动产的市价
and added the market value of your real estate,

461
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,340
得出总值大约为829000这个数字
giving me a total estimated value of $829,000,

462
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,380
于此同时我又很大方的多加了五万
on top of which I generously added an extra $50,000...

463
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,860
作为敬意
so as not to be insulting.

464
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,930
两千万
$20 million.

465
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,600
沃利兹先生
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz, this--

466
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,200
这是给沃尔特・怀特的价钱
This is the price for Walter White.

467
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,340
你以为我不知道你是谁
You don't think I know who you are?

468
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,840
我记得可清楚了
I remember.

469
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,810
我从未想过要冒名顶替
Well, I have not pretended to be any--

470
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,610
你的丈夫  他擅离职守
Your husband, he quit without giving me notice.

471
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,550
他弄坏了我的空气清新器
He broke my air fresheners.

472
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,080
他诅咒我  还抓自己来挑衅我
He cursed at me and grabbed himself.

473
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,490
现在他想买我的洗车场
And now he wants to buy my car wash.

474
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,060
又完全不像个男人来直面我说出这个要求
But he's not man enough to come in here and face me himself.

475
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,690
-而是派自己的女人来  -什么
- Instead, he sends his woman. - Excuse me?

476
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,090
沃尔特・怀特想买我的洗车场
Walter White wants to buy my car wash.

477
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,330
我给他开的价钱就是两千万
The price he pays is $20 million.

478
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:33,002
你可以走了
Now please leave.

479
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:51,650
你近期是否因空难失去最心爱的人
Have you recently lost a loved one on an aviation disaster?

480
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,910
你近期是否因飞机残骸
Have you suffered injury,

481
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,610
甚至跌落下来的身体残骸
shock to the senses,

482
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,730
受过感官方面的惊吓
or property damage as a result of airplane debris

483
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,190
或财产损失
or, God forbid, falling body parts?

484
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,790
告诉我  由我索尔・古德曼帮您解决
Then call me, Saul Goodman.

485
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,190
无需多言
It goes without saying

486
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,540
我能为您赢得
that the six-, seven-,

487
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,700
六位  七位  甚至是八位数字的
perhaps even eight-figure cash settlement

488
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,940
现金补偿
that I can win for you

489
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,340
都将永远无法填补悲剧发生
will never fill the hole in your heart

490
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,110
而造成您内心的空虚
caused by your tragic loss,

491
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,810
但您需要公正
but you deserve justice.

492
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,550
若您想扭转局势
So if you want to tip the scales

493
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,920
赢得官司
back in your favor,

494
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:21,878
就找索尔
better call Saul.

495
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:22,920
索尔・古德曼律师
Saul Goodman, attorney at law.

496
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,869
505-503-4455
505-503-4455.

497
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,150
提供西班牙语服务
Se habla espanol.

498
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,750
如果你打算一直跟踪下去
You might want to learn how to tail better

499
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,350
最好能学几招
if you're planning on making a habit of it.

500
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,990
能请你喝一杯吗
May I buy you a drink?

501
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,860
等你喝完  再来一杯
Next round, when you're done.

502
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:10,000
请吧  你赚得可比我多的去了
Why not? You make a hell of a lot more than I do.

503
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,930
给他再来一杯
Uh, another round for him,

504
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,450
我也一样  不加冰
and I'll have the same. No ice.

505
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:32,910
我觉得我需要解释下
I feel like I need to explain myself.

506
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,490
希望你能够理解
There were some actions that I took

507
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,490
我的某些举动
which I want you to understand.

508
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,670
我并不希望发生这一切
I didn't want any of this to happen.

509
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,270
我的所作所为
Everything I did

510
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,340
都是出于对伙伴的忠诚
I did out of loyalty to my partner,

511
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,780
当然了  后来
and then, later, of course,

512
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,510
纯粹是出于正当防卫
it was purely out of self-defense.

513
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,450
希望你能理解
I hope you can appreciate that...

514
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,920
正如我能理解
just like I appreciated that, uh--

515
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,930
我能理解  你意图杀我
I appreciate that when you were going to kill me

516
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,130
只是在奉命行事
you were simply following orders.

517
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,130
我完全理解
I get that completely.

518
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,700
且不会心怀怨恨
And I harbor no ill will.

519
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,640
那我就放心了
Well, there's a load off my mind.

520
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,580
麦克  我是想说
Mike, I'm trying to tell you--

521
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,940
我懂
I get it.

522
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,860
行了
Fine.

523
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,550
喝酒吧  沃尔特
Drink up, Walter.

524
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,560
最近几周噩耗连连
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

525
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,440
不禁叫人怀疑自己的处境
Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands.

526
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,550
我是说
I mean, I--

527
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,380
维克多死后
I cannot be alone in feeling this way.

528
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,550
不可能只有我有这感觉吧
Not after what happened to Victor.

529
00:40:11,963 --> 00:40:13,231
那么
So...

530
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,000
带手枪干嘛
what's with the piece?

531
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,200
你右边腰带上
Right hip inside your waistband.

532
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,070
那天在实验室我就注意到了
I noticed it the other day at the lab.

533
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,600
带着它能让你安心吧
You wear it if it makes you feel better,

534
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,010
但若真到事态严重  它可帮不上忙
but if push comes to shove, it's not going to help.

535
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,610
麦克  非得要我直说吗
Mike, do I have to come right out and say this?

536
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,950
我们俩  是一条船上的蚂蚱
You and I, we're in the same boat.

537
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,380
还是喝你的酒吧
Drink your drink.

538
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,620
维克多死了  下一个可能就是你
If it happened to Victor, it could happen to you.

539
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,820
那算什么
And-- and what the hell was that anyway?

540
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,290
讯息吗
Hmm? A message?

541
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,880
他割断他的喉咙只为传递一条讯息吗
He cuts a man's throat just to send a message?

542
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,730
你是赢家  沃尔特
You won, Walter.

543
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,000
你得到了工作
You got the job.

544
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,770
帮你自己个忙
Do yourself a favor

545
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,570
知足常乐吧
and learn to take yes for an answer.

546
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,780
我现在是有工作了  但能做多久呢
Yeah, I got the job, but for how long?

547
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:12,090
让我和他共处一室
Get me in a room with him.

548
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,460
麦克  只要你让我们共处一室
Mike, just get me in a room,

549
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,030
剩下的交给我
and I'll do the rest.

550
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,230
你说完了吗
You done?

551
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,640
说完了
Yeah.

552
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,640
谢谢你的酒
Thanks for the drink.

553
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,090
哥们  你的派对超赞  兄弟
Hey, my man, you know how to party, brother.

554
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,730
爽啊  爽
Epic! Epic!

555
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,530
怎么  你们两个要上哪里去
Uh, seriously, where are you two going?

556
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:36,870
杰西  我连着三天  几乎都没怎么合眼
Jesse, I've been awake for, like, three straight days.

557
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,940
我都快变凹凸曼了
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

558
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,640
那就在这里过夜吧  又不是没地方
So crash here. It's not like I ain't got the space.

559
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,110
这主意不错
Yeah, that's cool and all,

560
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,710
但我好像养了只猫
but I think I got, like, this cat.

561
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,890
我该  回去喂食了
I think I'm, like, supposed to feed it.
