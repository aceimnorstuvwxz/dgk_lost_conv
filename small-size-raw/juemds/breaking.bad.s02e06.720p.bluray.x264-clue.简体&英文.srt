00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,055
这是5还是S
Is this a 5 or an S?

00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,065

14
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:10,052
神啊  你怎么连"street"(街)
Jesus, how the hell do you spell

15
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:13,001
都能拼成"streat"
"street" wrong?S-T-R-E-A-T?

16
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,019
兄弟
Hey, man.

17
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,099
我可是拼了命的散货收钱
I'm slinging mad volume and fat-stacking

18
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,092
聪明蛋  你懂我意思吗
Benjis, you know what I'm saying?

19
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:20,075
我可不是全知全能的  连拼写那种傻事都会
I can't be all about,like, spelling and shit.

20
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:23,069
有名字吗
So they got names?

21
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,053
她的名字  恩  我不知道
Hers is, like, I don't know.

22
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,066
只知道她是个女人
She's just this woman is all.

23
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,035
男的  别人叫他精虫
Him they call Spooge.

24
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,095
精虫
Spooge?

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,021
不是疯狗  也不是猛男
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

26
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:38,027
我就直说吧  你被抢了
So let me get this straight.You got jacked

27
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:39,087
还是被一个叫精虫的人
by a guy named Spooge?

28
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:42,033
这关他的名字什么事
Yo, what's his name matter?

29
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:43,083
我满眼尽是他的刀
All's I saw was that knife

30
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,070
那么大一把直抵着我的脸
he stuck in my face, like that big!

31
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:48,071
但如果你是在找不做这事儿的理由的话
But if you're looking for a reason not to go do this thing...

32
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:51,000
-我有那么说么  -我就自己去做  行了吧
- Did I say that?  - 'Cause I'll go do it myself, right?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,063
我只是还在假释期
It's just I'm on probation and all.

34
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,073
就是说你打算做咯
So you gonna do it?

35
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:02,040
很好  不错
Good. Right on.

00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,023
我的钱在哪
Where's my money?

45
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:54,005

今晚  在这套钢制神器中
Tonight, in this steel knockout...

65
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:10,001
嘿  家里其他人呢

嘿  你不想看看其他节目吗
Yo, don't you want to watch something other than this?

71
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:16,055
比如说  《罗杰斯先生》
Like, I don't know, Mr. Rogers?

72
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:57,035
你父母什么时候回家
So when your folks coming home?

73
00:08:58,096 --> 00:09:00,035
你爸爸  精虫先生
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?

我饿了
I'm hungry.

00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,013
好啊  你们一家子
Hey there, you three.

00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:18,047
我只是想祝沃尔特第一天上班顺利归来
Just wanted to wish Walt a good first day back.

78
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:19,077
我们在想
We'll be thinking about you

79
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:23,026
你会教原子价和共有原子价还有
teaching valences and covalences and...

80
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,089
好吧  我大概就记得这些了  祝好运
Okay, that's officially all I remember. Good luck.

81
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,047
斯凯勒有空给我打个电话
Skyler, give me a call when you get a chance.

82
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,093
好啊  沃尔特和斯凯勒  我是格雷琴·施瓦兹
Hi, Walt and Skyler. This is Gretchen Schwartz,

83
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:38,024
只是打声招呼
Just calling to say hello.

84
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:39,073
我今天从圣达菲过来
I'm down from Santa Fe today,

85
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:41,034
立即就想到了你们俩
And I was just thinking about you both,

86
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:42,098
希望一切都好
Hoping everything's well.

87
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:44,051
我试着打沃尔特的手机
I tried Walt's cell, and it said

88
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,018
但他的号码无法接通
The number had been disconnected,

89
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,010
所以我希望一切都好
So I'm just hoping that everything's okay.

90
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,006
方便的时候给我回个电话
Call me if you can, whenever's convenient.

91
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:57,066
我是斯凯勒·怀特
This is Skyler White.

92
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:59,081
我是不是打扰你了
Am I catching you at a bad time?

93
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,021
没  完全没有
No, not at all.

94
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:04,037
接到你的电话太好了
It's so good to hear from you.

95
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,060
家人都好吗
How is everybody?

96
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,092
很好 谢谢关心
Very well, thank you.

97
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,071
沃尔特今天去上班了
Walt is actually at work today.

98
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,082
这是他第一天回去工作
It's his first day back at work,

99
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:14,098
他丢了手机  有一阵子了
And he lost his cell phone quite a while back.

100
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:17,046
真希望我们没让你操心
And I really hope we didn't worry you.

101
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:19,047
不会  这太好了
No No.I'm just so glad to hear that

102
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,081
大家都好  太棒了
Everybody's fine. That's wonderful.

103
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:27,026
很抱歉我现在才告诉你
I'm so very, very long overdue in telling you this,

104
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,089
但是我得遵守和沃尔特之间约定
And I just have to take Walt at his word

105
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,032
他把这事儿托付给我了
That he's been passing it along for me.

106
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:33,029
他是那么执着地
I mean, he's been so adamant about

107
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,018
想一个人处理这件事
Wanting to handle this whole thing by himself.

108
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:39,011
一直都想跟你通话
But I have picked up the phone

109
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:41,021
但是每次一拿起电话  我就
about a hundred times. I just...

110
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:45,074
-怎么了  -我
- What is it?  - I can't...

111
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:47,044
都不知道怎么感谢
begin to thank you and Elliott

112
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:49,015
你和埃利奥特所做的事了
For what you've done.

113
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:53,094
沃尔特的治疗费
The money for Walt's treatment, it's just...

114
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,001
拯救了整个家
It's saved us.

115
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:03,044
我不知道自己是否
I don't know if I...

116
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:04,087
沃尔特总是说
Walt keeps saying,

117
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,029
"别打扰他们了  这没什么"
"Don't bother them.It's no big deal."

118
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,097
但这真的很重要
But it is a big deal.

119
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,070
对我来说
To me.

120
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,059
对我们所有人来说
And to all of us.

121
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:14,016
所以我
So I just...

122
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:17,034
最终决定要
finally wanted to...

123
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,000
对你说声谢谢
say thank you.

124
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:28,075
说完了
Anyway.End of speech

125
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:31,026
希望我们能很快再见面
So, I do hope we get to see you soon.

126
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:34,008
说真的  无论什么时候你来
Truly, anytime you're in town,

127
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:36,073
任何时候都行
anytime at all is good for us.

128
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:39,007
今天下午怎么样
How about this afternoon?

129
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:46,003
单烯烃

130
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:47,077
二烯烃
diolefins,

131
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:50,072
三烯烃  聚烯烃
trienes, polyenes.

132
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:54,063
光这些专有名词就够让你晕头转向了
The nomenclature alone is enough to make your head spin.

133
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,003
但当你不知所措的时候  你只要
But when you start to feel overwhelmed, and you will,

134
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,052
牢记一个元素
just keep in mind that one element.

135
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,038
碳
Carbon.

136
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:10,022
碳是一切的关键
Carbon is at the center of it all.

137
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:14,006
没有碳就没有生命
There is no life without carbon.

138
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:17,051
在我们所知道的宇宙中  碳元素无处不在
Nowhere. That we know of in the universe.

139
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:19,062
一切有生命的
Everything that lives,

140
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,082
死去的  即将诞生的
lived, will live.

141
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,046
都是碳元素组成的
Carbon.

142
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:28,006
卡门是碳元素组成的
Carmen is carbon.

143
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:30,066
抱歉  卡门副校长
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.

144
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,011
你有没有
Did you...

我喜欢这么想
I like to think of it...

146
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,029
我认为钻石
I like to think that the diamond

147
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,020
和戴着钻石的女人
and the woman who wears it on her finger

148
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,094
都是由
are both formed

149
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:49,022
同一元素组成的
from the same stuff.

150
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:54,058
不如说钻石和发明钻石的男人
Or, say the diamond and the man who invented it.

151
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,068
你们感兴趣了  不是吗
That got your attention, right?

152
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,081
发明钻石的男人

158
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:24,010
人造钻石被应用于石油钻探

159
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,053
电子设备等数十亿美元的产业
electronics, multi-billion dollar industries.

160
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:31,085
那时候  霍尔教授  在为通用电气工作
At the time, Dr. Hall worked for General Electric.

161
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:34,049
并为他们带来了一笔不小的财富
And he made them a fortune.

162
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:36,072
不可计数的财富

163
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:44,018
你们想知道通用怎么回报霍尔博士的吗

167
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,053
以奖励他以碳元素为基础的

-闭嘴  -你才闭嘴

200

209
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:35,026
我也是这么想的
Here's what I think.

210
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:38,077
你告诉我他们是谁  然后

我和你一起给他们头上套上袋子

把他们捆起来
We tie them up,

213
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:44,094
把他们运到沙漠里
Drive them way out into the desert,

214
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:46,021
再剥光他们的衣服
Strip them naked,

215
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:48,064
然后把他们埋到满是火蚁的沙堆里
Then bury them up to their necks

216
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:50,099
只露出脖子以上

235
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,082
不过光头太惊悚了
Though a bald head is a bit of a shocker.

236
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:31,037
我知道这是为了我

我们不奢求什么报答
We don't want to ever hear that.

247
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,059
我不想那么说
You know what?  I hate to say it,

248
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:06,069

我的钱在哪  贱人

我不会好声好气问你的

我觉得我能看见重影

281

或许我该去医院看看
Maybe I need to go see a hospital.

282
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:04,011
说真的  我可能脑震荡了

00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:13,026
把口袋里东西都掏出来
Empty your pockets.

288
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:15,083
把口袋翻出来  都放在桌子上
Turn them out, everything on the table.

289
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,067
快
Do it!

290
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:23,057
很好  转过身去
All right, turn around.

291
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:25,002
转身
Turn around!

292
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:27,082
把后面的口袋也翻出来  快
Turn out your back pockets.Come on.

293
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:35,055
好的  鞋子  放到这里
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

294
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,036
我告诉过你  猛男  我们一点也没留下
I told you, Diesel, we ain't holding any...

295
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:53,061
全磕完了
We shot it all.

296
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,052
一天半能磕掉一盎司那么多
Shot an ounce in a day and a half.

297
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:59,051
好吧  让我告诉你吧
All right, tell you what.

298
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:04,001
你们俩现在马上把它从屁股里掏出来
Both of you pull it out of your butts right now

299
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:07,072
不然我亲自拿上手电筒和钳子来找
or I grab a flashlight and some pliers and go exploring.

300
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,010
还等什么  快点
What's it going to be? Come on!

301
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,069
就是这样
There you go.

302
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,039
很好  快  放桌子上
All right, come on. On the table.

303
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,009
怎么  你拿冰毒 
So what? You hold the crystal,

304
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,076
她拿海洛因  是吧
and she holds the H, huh?

305
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:26,042
分工合作
Division of labor.

306
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:30,068
好吧  这儿大概有八分之一盎司的货
All right, there's maybe an 8-ball here.

307
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:33,053
别的呢
Where's the rest of my meth?

308
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:36,041
说真的  她爽歪了把它们丢了
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

309
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:38,054
-你闭嘴  -闭嘴  贱人
- You shut up!  - Shut up, skank.

310
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,042
闭嘴  给我停手
Shut up! Stop it!

311
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:43,060
情况一点也没好转 
This really isn't getting any better.

312
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:45,057
头盖骨都扭曲了
It's turning cranial.

313
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:49,026
你看见这把枪了吧  里面有五发子弹
You see this gun, huh? It's got five bullets.

314
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:50,090
两人每个膝盖骨吃一颗
One for each kneecap,

315
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,067
再给你的头盖骨额外一枪
Plus an extra round for your cranial,

316
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:54,032
就因为你太娇气了
for being such a pussy.

317
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,033
宝贝
Hey, baby.

318
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:02,069
过来  宝贝
Come here, baby.

319
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:04,024
快过来  宝贝
Come here, baby.

320
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:11,067
行了
All right.

321
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:15,092
你们俩再也别想嗑药了
You two are never getting high again.

322
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:18,094
我一辈子都不会让你们爽的
I will make it my life's mission.

323
00:25:18,094 --> 00:25:21,082
针剂啊  冰毒啊  啥都别想了
Not another needle, not another ball,

324
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:25,032
在我拿到属于我的东西之前  一口都别想吸
Not one toke, not till I get what's mine.

325
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:30,032
我们会搞定的  绝不赖账
We got you covered, man, sure.

326
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:31,084
碰巧我们刚有钱给你  
It just so happens we got

327
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:33,079
加上利息
your money, man, plus interest.

328
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,006
这才像话  还有利息  在哪
You're damn right, plus interest. Where?

329
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,041
后院
Backyard.

330
00:25:38,022 --> 00:25:39,053
近在咫尺  后院  
Right hand to the man, dog.

331
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:40,083
你去检查吧
Backyard. Go check it out.

332
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,046
-起  -你弄伤我了  痛
- Get...  - Hurting. Painful.

333
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,041
我和你爸爸  
Me and your old man,

334
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,014
我们只是在玩个游戏  好吗
We're just playing a game, all right?

335
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,023
别动
Don't move.

336
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:55,058
快点
Come on!

337
00:25:58,082 --> 00:25:59,063
看见了?
See?

338
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:02,032
我和那个贱人刚刚抬回来的
Me and the slit just boosted it.

339
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:03,075
她像只蚂蚁
She's like ant, man.

340
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,022
她可以举起相当于自己体重
She can lift a hundred times

341
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,081
一百倍的重物  不骗你
her own weight. For real.

342
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,072
我他妈要这东西干什么
What the hell am I supposed to do with this?

343
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:10,023
帮我把它砸开  
Help me break it open.

344
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:11,074
把钱取出来  交货
Take out the money, get paid.

345
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,024
然后嗑药
Get high.

346
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:20,042
这是提款机
That's my bank.

347
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:22,054
那又怎么样  它有联邦存款保险
So?  It's FIDC insured.

348
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:24,065
这是场无人受害的犯罪
It's a victimless crime.

349
00:26:25,098 --> 00:26:27,056
你他妈哪里搞来的这玩意儿  
Where the hell did you get this?

350
00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:29,013
杂货店  城那边的
Bodega. Way across town.

351
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:32,022
快进快出  顺利得很
In, out, like bam. It was smooth as silk.

352
00:26:32,078 --> 00:26:34,026
什么  没人看见你们吗
What, nobody saw you?

353
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,003
有没有目击者  白痴
What about witnesses, dumb ass?

354
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:38,033
我们像风那么快  真的
We roll like the breeze, for real.

355
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,096
我们就这么进去了  一切顺利的很
All we did, we just walked in all smooth-like.

356
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:43,038
-根本没人注意  -真的没人注意
- Nobody even noticed.  - Nobody noticed?

357
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:44,094
-真的  -我告诉你
- For real?  - I'm telling you.

358
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:47,029
一场没有受害者的犯罪
A victimless crime.

359
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:04,021
上帝啊  你倒是快啊
Jesus! Come on already!

360
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,016
就快出钱了  我已经能感觉到了
It's about to give, man.  I'm sensing it.

361
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,035
你根本不知道你在做什么 
You don't know what you're doing.

362
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:08,066
我以为你说过
I thought you told me

363
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,076
你偷过  大概  6个这玩意儿
you boosted, like, six of these.

364
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:12,027
偷过
Boosted.

365
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:15,014
但一个都没打开过
It's not like he ever got one open.

366
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:18,028
至少我一直很专注  根据一般规律
At least I got persistence.  The law of averages,

367
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:19,078
幸运数字是7
lucky number 7.

368
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:22,014
别听那个混蛋的
Don't listen to that skank.

369
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,034
别那么叫我
Stop calling me that!

370
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:27,033
我不是什么混蛋
I ain't no skank!

371
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:29,033
混蛋  混蛋  乌龟王八蛋
Skank, skank, skank ass skank!

372
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:32,084
好吧  我对天发誓  
All right, I swear to God

373
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:35,073
我会直接崩了你们的脸
I will shoot you both in the face!

374
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:37,094
现在  保持冷静
Now chill!

375
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,099
你  继续开那玩意
You, get that thing open.

376
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,057
你他妈给我坐下  别乱扔东西
You sit the hell down, and no throwing things.

377
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,014
那个孩子呢
Where's the kid?

378
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:56,006
那个孩子  那个小屁孩
The kid! The little kid!

379
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:57,091
问我做什么
What are you asking me for?

380
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:27,023
你他妈算哪种妈妈?
What the hell kind of mother are you?

381
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,092
你也偶尔给孩子一顿
How about you feed the kid

382
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:30,030
体面点的饭如何
A decent meal every now and then?

383
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:32,012
给他洗个澡
Give him a bath.

384
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:33,098
再撒点爽身粉
Put some baby powder on him.

385
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,046
给他个像样的电视看看 
Get him some decent TV to watch.

386
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,095
这算什么
What is this shit?

387
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:38,062
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

388
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:40,019
你给我一针 
You give me one hit, and I'll be

389
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,035
你想让我做什么样的妈我就做什么样的妈
Any kind of mother that you want.

390
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:44,063
猛男  如果我们每人都能来一点
Diesel, this whole thing would go easier

391
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:46,044
这事儿就会简单多了
if we all had a little taste, man.

392
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:49,099
滚一边去
Get out of the way.

393
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:51,098
滚一边去
Get out of the way!

394
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:10,039
所以你谁也没告诉
So you didn't tell anyone.

395
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,079
-你没告诉埃利奥特   -还没有
- You didn't tell Elliott.  - Not yet.

396
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,012
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

397
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:17,097
就那意思
It means what it means.

398
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,097
这个决定  我还没法做
It's a determination I have yet to make.

399
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:27,011
好吧  够公平  不胜感激
All right. Fair enough.  I can appreciate that.

400
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:30,075
好吧  让我先说
All right. First let me say

401
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:34,087
我很后悔将你卷入此事
I very much regret involving you in this.

402
00:29:34,087 --> 00:29:35,092
这是
This was...

403
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:39,035
这整件事其实
This entire thing was...

404
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,045
很不幸
unfortunate.

405
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:42,056
不幸
Unfortunate?

406
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:47,029
我深表歉意
And I apologize deeply.

407
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,008
请告诉我你为什么要那么做
Now please tell me why you did it.

408
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,079
这不是我们要讨论的问题
That's not really at issue here.

409
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:02,004
你说你有保险 
You told me your insurance was

410
00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:04,011
是骗人的吗
covering it. Was that a lie?

411
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,050
如果你不准备要我们的钱
If you won't take our money

412
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:14,069
这问题与你无关 
This is not an issue that concerns you,

413
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:15,098
格雷琴  别问了
Gretchen, okay?

414
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:18,089
我很抱歉  但它确实与我有关
Excuse me. It does concern me.

415
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:20,031
有很大的关系
It concerns me greatly.

416
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:23,008
你告诉你的妻子和儿子
You tell your wife and son

417
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:25,073
我来付你治疗癌症的费用
that I am paying for your cancer treatment.

418
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,019
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

419
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:32,068
我会和他们解释清楚的
I will clear this up with them.

420
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,060
斯凯勒脸上的表情  
The look on Skyler's face...

421
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,032
她坐在那里  眼里噙着泪水
She's sitting there, tears in her eyes,

422
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,010
感谢我救了你的命  
Thanking me for saving your life.

423
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,083
你为什么要那么对她
Why would you do that to her?

424
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:42,051
我说了  我会把这事说清楚
As I said, I will clear this up.

425
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:43,082
请
Just please

426
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:46,091
允许我以自己的方式和时间来处理这件事
allow me to do this in my own way in my own time.

427
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:48,051
好吗
All right?

428
00:30:48,051 --> 00:30:51,053
我会向他们解释这整件事
I will explain the whole thing to them.

429
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:53,092
你在这么做的时候也请解释给我听
And while you're at it,explain it to me.

430
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:59,041
我并不欠你什么解释
I don't owe you an explanation.

431
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:03,028
我欠你一次道歉  而且我已经道歉了
I owe you an apology, and I have apologized.

432
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,042
我很抱歉  格雷琴
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

433
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:09,036
看  我已经道了两次歉了
There. I've apologized twice now.

434
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:12,020
我谦逊地向你道歉
I'm humbly sorry.

435
00:31:12,054 --> 00:31:13,064
三次了
Three times.

436
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,038
让我直说了吧
Let me just get this straight.

437
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:17,085
埃利奥特和我愿为你付医疗费
Elliott and I offer to pay for

438
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:20,055
完全无偿的
your treatment, no strings attached...

439
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:23,011
顺便说一声现在依旧如此
an offer which still stands,by the way...

440
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:25,055
你出于自尊心拒绝了我们
and you turn us down out of pride,

441
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:28,006
然后你告诉你的妻子
whatever, and then you tell your wife

442
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:30,064
其实我们在帮你付医疗费
that in fact we are paying for your treatment.

443
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:32,056
没经过我们允许  违背我们的意愿  
Without our knowledge, against our will,

444
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,091
你把我们卷入了你的谎言之中
you involve us in your lie.

445
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,091
然后你还能理直气壮地坐着
And you sit here and tell me

446
00:31:36,091 --> 00:31:39,081
跟我说这事情与我无关
that that is none of my business?

447
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:46,042
大概就是这么一件事
That's pretty much the size of it.

448
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:50,070
你这是怎么了
What happened to you?

449
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,054
说真的  沃尔特
Really, Walt.

450
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:57,085
发生了什么?
What happened?

451
00:31:58,097 --> 00:32:00,091
这不像你
Because this isn't you.

452
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,081
你觉得我是什么样的
What would you know about me?

453
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:10,099
在你心里
What would your presumption

454
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:13,025
我是什么样的
about me be, exactly?

455
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:16,034
我应该祈求你的捐助吗
That I should go begging for your charity?

456
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,091
然后你把支票簿一挥
And you waving your checkbook around,

457
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:22,084
就像挥魔棒似的
like some magic wand,

458
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:25,080
就可以让我原谅
is going to make me forget how you

459
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,018
当初你和埃利奥特背叛我的事情
and Elliott cut me out?

460
00:32:28,018 --> 00:32:30,022
什么  事情并非如此
What? That can't be how you see it.

461
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:32,039
那是我的辛勤工作  我的研究所得
It was my hard work, my research, and

462
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,004
你和埃利奥特以此赚了几百万
You and Elliott make millions off it.

463
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:36,000
事情不是这样的
That cannot be how you see it.

464
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:38,024
-太好了  干得漂亮  -你离开了
- Good. That's beautifully done. - You left...

465
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,029
你总是一副天真无辜的样子
You are always the picture of innocence.

466
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:42,090
-你离开了我  -那副天真无辜的样子
- You left me.  - The picture of innocence.

467
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,008
-甜美而令人振奋  -你离开了我
- Just sweetness and light.  - You left me.

468
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,001
纽波特  7月4日那个周末
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

469
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:50,043
你  我父亲和我兄弟 
You and my father and my brothers,

470
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:52,008
我回到房间
and I go up to our room,

471
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,090
你在整理行李  几乎不说话
and you're packing your bags,barely talking.

472
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,036
什么  难道这些都只是我的空想吗
What? Did I dream all that?

473
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:59,057
那是你的借口
That's your excuse...

474
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:03,052
依靠我的成果建造你的公司
to build your little empire on my work?

475
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:04,090
你怎么能这么对我说  
How can you say that to me?

476
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,027
是你离开了
You walked away.

477
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:09,075
你抛弃了我们  我  埃利奥特
You abandoned us... me, Elliott.

478
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:12,026
小富婆只是累积你的资产
Little rich girl just adding to your millions.

479
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:19,022
我都不知道该对你说什么好了
I don't even know what to say to you.

480
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:22,084
我都不知道从哪儿说起
I don't even know where to begin.

481
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,068
我对你
I feel so...

482
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:33,054
很失望  沃尔特
sorry for you, Walt.

483
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:38,072
去你妈的
Fuck you.

484
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:20,092
孩子
Little man,

485
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:22,096
你饿了吗
you hungry?

486
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:03,084
你在做什么
What are you doing?

487
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:11,080
精虫  我抓住他了  我抓住他了
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

488
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,015
亲爱的  起来帮帮我
Baby, get up and help me!

489
00:35:14,023 --> 00:35:15,099
既然你叫我坏妈妈
Call me a bad mother.

490
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:17,088
就让你看看坏妈妈是什么样的  混蛋
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

491
00:35:17,088 --> 00:35:19,072
起来 操  拿好货
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

492
00:35:23,072 --> 00:35:24,068
该睡觉了
Bedtime.

493
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,052
到手了
Here we go.

494
00:35:36,002 --> 00:35:38,079
现在谁是大哥大  是你吗
Who's the big tough guy now?Is that you?

495
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,051
你是老大吗  
You're the big man?

496
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:42,052
有种打我啊 混蛋
Try and hit me now, bitch!

497
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:43,095
有种打我啊  
Try and hit me now!

498
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:45,037
现在就打我啊  贱人
Try and hit me now, bitch!

499
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,056
我能问问你刚去了哪吗
Should I ask where you've been?

500
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,011
算了
Never mind.

501
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,009
过去就过去吧
We're long past that, I suppose.

502
00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:39,065
格雷琴一个小时前打了个电话过来
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

503
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,069
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

504
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:08,053
说吧
Just say it.

505
00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:21,011
他们停止给钱了
They're cutting off the money.

506
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:36,014
她到底说了什么
What did she say, exactly?

507
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:41,050
没说多少  就是
Not much. It was...

508
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:45,083
很突然  她说
Abrupt. She said...

509
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,075
大概说的是
something like...

510
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:51,074
"我很抱歉
"I'm sorry...

511
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:54,075
"不得不这么做  埃利奥特和我
"to have to do this, but Elliott and I

512
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:56,032
"无法再继续付
"can no longer continue

513
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:57,094
沃尔特的医疗费
to pay for Walt's treatment.

514
00:37:58,048 --> 00:38:00,095
"你们一切都好"
"I wish you the very best."

515
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:05,018
就这些
And that was it.

516
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,015
她听起来像在道歉
She sounded apologetic.

517
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:19,061
我觉得  一切发生得很快 
I guess, it was quick.

518
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:20,046
她马上就挂了电话
She got right off the phone.

519
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,072
我很震惊  但
I was so stunned, but...

520
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:27,003
我打回去  她没有接
I called her back, and she didn't pick up.

521
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,012
那么
So...

522
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,050
关于这事你都知道多少
what do you know about this?

523
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:45,082
今天下午她和我
She and I had a perfectly

524
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:47,029
聊得很开心
nice visit this afternoon,

525
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:49,021
然后你回家了  
and then you come home, and all of

526
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:51,025
然后她突然就急着要离开
a sudden she's in a big hurry to leave,

527
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:52,010
然后你们俩就在
and then the two of you

528
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,040
车道上又聊了起来
are talking in the driveway.

529
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:02,076
你知道些什么我不知道的
What do you know that I don't?

530
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:09,040
你今晚去哪儿
Where were you tonight?

531
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:14,014
我开车去了圣达菲
I drove up to Santa Fe.

532
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:17,086
我和格雷琴在一起
I was with Gretchen...

533
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:20,062
当然  格雷琴还有埃利奥特
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

534
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:25,052
今天  她就是
She just couldn't bring

535
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:27,002
不忍心告诉你
herself to tell you today.

536
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:28,038
我是说  她也不忍心告诉我  
I mean, she couldn't tell me,

537
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:29,075
真的
either, really.

538
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:31,054
他们都在
There was a lot of...

539
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:34,017
经历一些
hemming and hawing and beating

540
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:36,016
混乱  挫折
around the bush from both of them...

541
00:39:36,016 --> 00:39:38,049
告诉我们是什么
What... Tell us what?

542
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,033
很多
There was a lot of

543
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:50,015
商业用语掺杂其中
business phraseology being tossed around,

544
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,058
比如
Things like...

545
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:55,044
"现金短缺"和"周转不灵"
"cash poor" and "leveraged"

546
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:57,064
还有"季度收入下降" 什么什么的
and "quarterly decline," yada, yada, yada.

547
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:01,022
但是我觉得  他们其实是在说
But what they were truly saying, in my opinion...

548
00:40:05,082 --> 00:40:07,030
他们破产了
They're broke.

549
00:40:08,017 --> 00:40:10,059
你在开玩笑吧
You are kidding me.

550
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:13,038
我是说  现在经济状况很糟
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.

551
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:14,058
这我们都知道
We all know that.

552
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,078
这些大银行和
And all these big banks and...

553
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:18,075
范美妮以及
Fannie Mae and...

554
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,077
显然
Apparently,

555
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:23,087
头脑风暴相比于其他公司
Gray Matter is no more immune

556
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:26,014
也会受点影响
than anyone else.

557
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,071
就是说
That is...

558
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:32,033
天啊  也就是说
Jesus, that's...

559
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:49,092
她很可能刚刚想
She could have just...

560
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:53,042
亲自告诉我
told me herself.

561
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,079
他们是自尊很强的人
Well, they're prideful people.

562
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,086
听着
Listen.

563
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,028
不是我自私
Not to sound selfish,

564
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:09,062
但既然我们都到这一步了
but as far as we go,

565
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,062
我们得撑过去  好吗
we'll get through this, okay?

566
00:41:16,037 --> 00:41:19,035
他们已经付了我的大部分医疗费
They've already paid for most of my treatment,

567
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:20,026
对吗
right?

568
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:28,094
我们能搞定
We're going to make it.

569
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:31,070
对吧  我保证
All right? I promise.

570
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:45,083
但是
And yet...

571
00:41:47,065 --> 00:41:50,029
她还开着宾利车
she still drives a Bentley.

572
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:58,026
强撑面子还是
Keeping up appearances or...

573
00:41:58,026 --> 00:41:59,056
我不知道  谁知道呢
I don't know. Who knows?

574
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:15,096
宝贝  这没道理啊
Baby, that don't make any sense.

575
00:42:15,096 --> 00:42:17,019
当然有道理  
Of course it makes sense.

576
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:19,099
每个保险箱都有它的弱点  不是么
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

577
00:42:20,022 --> 00:42:21,020
如果由你来设计一个保险箱  
Say you're designing a safe. Where

578
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,013
你会把弱点设置在哪里
are you going to put your weak spot?

579
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:24,025
哪里都不放
Nowhere.

580
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,037
我要把它造的
I made it, like...

581
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,001
特别结实
strong.

582
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,037
上帝啊  放在底部  就是那儿
Jesus! On the bottom, that's where.

583
00:42:30,037 --> 00:42:32,059
你把你的弱点放在底部
You put your weak spot on the bottom.

584
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,030
宝贝  海洛因让我
Baby, that H is...

585
00:42:35,093 --> 00:42:37,097
犯困
bringing me down.

586
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:40,080
-你吸得太多了  我告诉过你 -我需要
- You took too much. I told you.  - I need...

587
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,008
我得振奋一下  
I need to even out.

588
00:42:43,008 --> 00:42:44,090
让我吸一口冰毒
Let me get a hit of that crystal.

589
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,067
不行  你已经吸掉了你那份了
Hell, no. You've lost your share.

590
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:48,003
拜托  宝贝
Come on, baby.

591
00:42:48,015 --> 00:42:51,034
我只要一小口就行
It's all I need is just a little hit.

592
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,011
给我闭嘴  你这个混蛋  
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.

593
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:54,089
我正在努力集中精力
I'm trying to concentrate.

594
00:42:55,054 --> 00:42:57,069
我不是混蛋
I ain't no skank.

595
00:42:58,018 --> 00:43:02,012
我需要一个道歉
I would appreciate an apology.

596
00:43:05,074 --> 00:43:06,071
什么
What?

597
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:09,062
我想要高潮
I am trying to take the high road here.

598
00:43:09,062 --> 00:43:11,023
你准备给我吗
Are you going to do right?

599
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:12,096
听着  笨蛋
Listen to me, stupid.

600
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:16,034
我做某项很重要的工作正到一半
I am in the middle of some very important work.

601
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:18,034
我马上就能搞定了  明白不
I am on the verge here, all right?

602
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:20,031
所以闭上你的臭嘴
So shut your skank ass pie hole

603
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,055
过来帮忙  住嘴
and assist me and shut up!

604
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,059
我不是混蛋
I ain't no skank.

605
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:32,011
混蛋  混蛋  王八蛋
Skank, skank, skank ass skank!

606
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,069
王八蛋
Skank ass skank!

607
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,049
王八蛋
Skank ass skank!

608
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:37,079
听着  混蛋
You listening to me skank?

609
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,027
你听到我说什么吗  混蛋
You hear me, skank?

610
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:42,085
你是个王八蛋
You are a skank ass skank!

611
00:43:47,055 --> 00:43:50,001
我不是混蛋
I ain't no skank.

612
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:52,004
不要
Don't!

613
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,002
我不是混蛋
I ain't no skank.

614
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,030
你还记得躲猫猫吗  
Remember peekaboo?

615
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,080
你能不能这样躲起来
Can you go peekaboo like this?

616
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:32,058
你可以闭上眼吗
Can you keep your eyes closed?

617
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,034
很好  太好了  好的
That's good. That's real good. All right.

618
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:38,033
你就像那样闭上眼睛
You keep them closed just like that.

619
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:40,083
我们将要玩一个小游戏
It's a little game we're going to play.

620
00:45:57,078 --> 00:46:00,090
听着  你在这儿等着  好吗
Look at me. You wait right here. Okay?

621
00:46:00,098 --> 00:46:02,063
这只是游戏的一部分  
It's just part of the game.

622
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:04,028
你在这儿等  然后
You wait right here, and...

623
00:46:06,052 --> 00:46:09,013
听着  就是别回头朝里面看
Look, just... just don't go back inside.

624
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:12,043
好吗  你就呆在这儿  好吗
All right? You stay right here. Okay?

625
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:23,009
祝你余生幸福  孩子
You have a good rest of your life, kid.
