你不会今天还想去工作吧
You're not thinking about going to work today, are you?

14
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:32,034
可能会的
Thought I would.

15
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,034
吸入器好像还挺管用的
That inhaler really seems to be doing the trick.

16
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:37,053
-怎么了  -这星期就休息吧
- What? - Just take the rest of the week.

17
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,059
求你了
Please.

18
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:40,049
这是你应得的
You've earned it.

19
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:42,009
别把自己逼太紧
Don't push it.

20
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:45,070
另外  我还想你为这周末作准备
Besides, I want you well for the weekend.

21
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:50,003
妈妈想要开  派对
Mom wants to par-tay.

22
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:53,061
只是个小聚会  仅此而已
It's just a little get-together, that's all.

23
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:56,043
有可能在周日下午
Sunday afternoon, maybe?

24
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:59,045
不会很隆重  就家人和一些朋友
Nothing too big. Just family and a few friends.

25
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,092
我们有很多值得庆祝的事
We've got a lot to celebrate.

26
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,035
你不觉得吗
Don't you think?

27
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:07,056
听起来不错
Sounds good.

28
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,051
现在
Now,

29
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,034
你今天打算干什么
What are you supposed to do today?

30
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,049
什么也不做
Nothing.

31
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,007
很好
Excellent.

32
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,097
小精灵告诉你应该再小睡一会儿
Brownie points for taking a nap.

33
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,062
能出来见面吗
Can you meet?

34
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,071
我还以为你可能
I thought maybe you...

35
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,082
可能已经
Might have, you know,

36
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:20,035
不在了
Kicked.

37
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,067
驾鹤西去了
Signed off.

38
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:25,063
我都在看讣告
I was even checking the obits.

39
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,002
还没那么好的运气
No such luck.

40
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,066
那情况怎么样
So where does it stand?

41
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:36,036
咳嗽带血  还说
Coughing up blood, giving speeches like,

42
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,044
"这是我应得的  我是个混蛋"
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

43
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:41,068
结果怎么样
What's the upshot?

44
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:44,002
结果
The upshot.

45
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:51,015
结果就是我患了放射性肺炎
The upshot is that I have radiation pneumonitis.

46
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,070
该死
Damn.

47
00:05:57,088 --> 00:06:00,039
实际上并没有听起来那么糟
Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds.

48
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:05,015
是很常见的并发症  很容易治愈
It's a fairly common occurrence, easily treated.

49
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,010
是个好消息
The news is all good.

50
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,053
你说好是什么意思
What do you mean, good?

51
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,055
就是指治好了吗
You mean, like, good good?

52
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:21,067
还是说  症状部分缓解
You mean, like, remission good?

53
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,029
症状缓解
Remission.

54
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,050
不是说我完全好了
Not to imply I'm cured.

55
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:28,017
我现在还是有癌症
I still have cancer.

56
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:32,056
但肿瘤组织已经减小了很多
But there's been a significant reduction in the tumors.

57
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:34,006
有多少
How significant?

58
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,011
80%
80%.

59
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,022
伙计
Dude!

60
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,057
不可能吧
No way!

61
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,037
不管怎样
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,

62
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:42,064
我还没有脱离危险
Not by any stretch.

63
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,064
但他们老把"机会"挂在嘴边
"Options" is the word they keep bandying about.

64
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:49,047
太好了
That's awesome!

65
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,075
真的吗
Serious?

66
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:53,061
这太棒了
That's great, man.

67
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,000
我是说  我姑姑她  从没
I mean, my aunt, she never...

68
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:59,045
在你这样的阶段  我从没想过还会好
I mean, at your stage, I didn't think that could happen.

69
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:04,083
怀特老师  你太厉害了  哟
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

70
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,050
你肯定高兴坏了
You must be so psyched.

71
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,092
确实很高兴
Of course. I am.

72
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:13,055
现在我们
Now we...

73
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,037
我是说  我们接下来
I mean, what do we...

74
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,077
我差点忘了
I almost forgot.

75
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:27,007
那么
So,

76
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,064
你想怎样
How do you want to,

77
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,080
继续我们的生意
You know, proceed

78
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,065
在得到这么好的消息以后
In light of this kick-ass news?

79
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:42,079
我们要慢慢来  谨慎一些
We'll take our time and stay cautious.

80
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,047
把剩下的货都卖完
Sell off what we have.

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,005
然后
And then...

82
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,070
然后我想
Then I guess...

83
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,074
就结束吧
I'm done.

84
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,013
各就各位
Batter up!

85
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,045
大家注意
Everyone?

86
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,091
大家好  我想要敬大家一杯
Hey, you guys. I would like to make a toast,

87
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,081
用我的无酒精饮料
With my non-alcoholic beverage.

88
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:29,002
谁把音乐关一下
Somebody kill the music.

89
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,076
我知道一个小小的派对不能报答
I know one party can't begin to repay

90
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:35,041
你们所有的支持和
All your support and your...

91
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,006
你们那么多的帮助
Your many, many kindnesses.

92
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:40,048
不过
But then again,

93
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,066
汉克还是准备了些玛格丽塔鸡尾酒
Hank does make one mean margarita.

94
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,045
我们衷心感谢大家
We really do want to thank you.

95
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:54,020
过去的这几个月
These last few months have been...

96
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:58,075
婉转得说  是个考验
A challenging time, to put it mildly.

97
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:03,077
但沃尔特勇敢地克服了一切
But I have to say Walt's come through it like a champ.

98
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:05,080
亲爱的  我太为你感到骄傲了
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

99
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:13,074
我不能再说这些煽情的话了
I'm gonna stop with the sappy stuff.

100
00:09:14,098 --> 00:09:16,084
但这是真的  确实如此
But it's true. It really is.

101
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:20,016
长久以来  第一次
And for the first time in a long time,

102
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:23,010
我们对未来满怀憧憬
We are so excited about the future.

103
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,006
无论如何
Anyway,

104
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:31,030
我还要向另外两个特殊的人
I want to also express my gratitude

105
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:33,090
表达我的感激之情
To two very special people

106
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,006
虽然他们今天不在这里
Who couldn't be here today.

107
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:39,068
但他们也感到遗憾并送来了贴心的祝福
But they send their regrets and their warm wishes.

108
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,045
格雷琴和埃利奥特·施瓦茨
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz,

109
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:44,036
尽管你们不认识他们
For those of you who don't know them are...

110
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,067
他们真的是英雄
Well, they're heroes.

111
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,087
他们无限慷慨
They are incredibly generous

112
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:53,004
答应为沃尔特支付治疗费用
friends who made

113
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:55,066
此乃真朋友也
To pay for Walt's treatment.

114
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,017
他们说到做到
And they did.

115
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,079
所以
So...

116
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,060
为格雷琴和埃利奥特干一杯
To Gretchen and Elliott.

117
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,060
还有我们的主角  快
How about the man of the hour? Come on!

118
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,064
给我们讲两句
Speech!

119
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:22,016
说来有趣
It's kind of funny.

120
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,091
我得知自己被诊断为
When I got my diagnosis,

121
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,043
癌症时
Cancer,

122
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:29,089
我问自己
I said to myself,

123
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,045
"为什么是我"
"Why me?"

124
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
后来
And then,

125
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:41,076
那天当我知道好消息的时候
The other day, when I got the good news...

126
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,099
我问自己同样的问题
I said the same thing.

127
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,011
谢谢大家能来
Thank you for coming.

128
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:05,074
好好玩
Enjoy.

129
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:08,053
干杯
Cheers.

130
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:12,051
很鼓舞人
Inspirational.

131
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,099
我跟你说  我要给那帮混蛋
Tell you what. I gotta give those

132
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,039
一点新花样
Bastards points for originality

133
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,084
请听我娓娓道来
I'll tell you that much.

134
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:21,019
一个水银开关  9伏特电池
A little mercury switch, 9-volt battery,

135
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,042
五六盎司C4塑胶炸药
5 or 6 ounces of C4,

136
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,093
这帮毒贩们就这么狂欢的
That's how those cartel boys party.

137
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:28,078
可是为什么是海龟
But why a turtle?

138
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,044
这个最有意思了  它是
That's the best part. It was a...

139
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:34,044
我到底想说什么词来着
What the hell's the word I'm looking for?

140
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:38,043
不是隐喻  不是类比  是
Not a metaphor, not an analogy... it's a...

141
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:41,028
沃尔特  我想说什么词来着
Walt. What's the word I'm looking for?

142
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:45,048
管它呢  "托尔图加"
Anyway, "tortuga."

143
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,041
我们的线人就叫这个名字
That was the name of our snitch.

144
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:50,024
英文意思是"玳瑁"
Bean-speak for "tortoise."

145
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:53,047
玳瑁  海龟  你
Tortoise, turtle, what have you...

146
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,085
我自己都不知道有什么区别
I never knew the difference myself.

147
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,059
帮我满上  好吗  兄弟
Top me off there, will you, buddy?

148
00:11:58,072 --> 00:11:59,058
不管怎么说
Anyway,

149
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:01,079
诗意化的
Poetic.

150
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:05,000
我猜  对  诗意化  诗意化说法
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.

151
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,072
就是这个词  我猜就是这个词
That's the word. I guess that's the word.

152
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,066
喝吧
Go ahead.

153
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,043
最好别让你妈看见
Better not let your mom see.

154
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:54,099
我看见一根头发  或许是两根
I think I see a hair. Maybe two!

155
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,066
里面没虫子吧
There's no worm in this, right?

156
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,016
没有  这是龙舌兰
No. That would be mescal.

157
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,039
说起喝醉酒来
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

158
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,031
有一次我在乔治亚州的格林科
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.

159
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,070
东部  在那儿受训
Back east, doing some training.

160
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,021
有个枪支指导员
Had this firearm instructor who was...

161
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:10,050
他是个特纯朴的人
He was a good ol' boy.

162
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:12,011
好了  谢谢
There you go. Thanks.

163
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:13,099
我是说  这家伙喝起酒来
I mean, this guy could put them

164
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,087
就像他有两个肝脏似的  懂吗
Away like he had two livers, okay?

165
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:18,050
喝酒就像鱼喝水  喝醉的了鱼
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

166
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:21,066
我们都灌龙舌兰灌懵了
We were drinking mescal stupid. But...

167
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:28,033
沃尔特  你这是干嘛
Hey... Hey. Walt. What are you doing there?

168
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,018
你看我像干嘛
What does it lookating. Come on.

169
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:32,089
这孩子才16岁
The kid's 16.

170
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:36,048
你要干嘛  争当年度最佳老爸
What are you, going for father of the year?

171
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:39,083
你看他干嘛
What are you looking at him for?

172
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,090
我们在庆祝呢  继续
We're celebrating. Come on.

173
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,044
听着  如果我是你的话
Listen, I'd take a pass on

174
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,026
这杯我就不喝
That one if I were you

175
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:27,063
别再教坏这孩子了
Think we've been bogarting this puppy long enough.

176
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:36,008
把酒瓶拿回来
Bring the bottle back.

177
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:41,012
对不起  老兄  恕难从命
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

178
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:44,082
我的儿子  我的酒  我的家
My son! My bottle! My house!

179
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:49,079
没事
It's all right.

180
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:51,067
你还等什么
What are you waiting for?

181
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,047
拿回来
Bring it back.

182
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,034
今天就这么着吧
Why don't we just call it a day?

183
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:05,076
行吗  兄弟
All right, pal?

184
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:09,044

马上给我
Now.

187
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,072
出什么事了
What's going on?

188
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,028
好了  宝贝
Here, sweetie.

189
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:04,039
这是你的脑子
This is your brain.

190
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,010
这是你吸毒之后的脑子
This is your brain on drugs.

191
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:26,004
你不该醒的
You weren't supposed to wake up.

192
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,042
永远别醒还是
Ever or...?

193
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:33,025
我本打算过会儿  你知道  端进去
I was just thinking that I'd bring it, you know, in.

194
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:36,073
要我回去躺着吗
You want me to go back to bed?

195
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,062
不用  我想那就有点儿
No. I guess that'd be kind of...

196
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,006
要帮忙吗
Need some help?

197
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,073
我能行
I got it.

198
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:52,093
你去坐着吧
Just have a seat.

199
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,058
有咖啡吗
Is there any coffee?

200
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:59,023
该死  稍等
Shit. One second.

201
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,066
至少这个让我来吧
At least let me do that.

202
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:04,083
我不想让你干一点儿活  明白吗
I don't want you to have to do anything, you know?

203
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,035
好了  成了
All right. Here.

204
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,034
好的那个给你
You take the good one.

205
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,054
这是墨西哥式煎蛋
It's Huevos Rancheros.

206
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,037
看得出来
I can tell.

207
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:26,008
叉子
Fork.

208
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:38,066
给你
There you go.

209
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,019
那你今天打算做什么
So what are you up to today?

210
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:45,023
工作吗  不管是什么工作
Working? Whatever that means.

211
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,040
我陪着你
I'm all yours.

212
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,049
真的
Really?

213
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,050
你好  我是斯凯勒  请留言  谢谢
Hey, this is Skyler. Please leave me a message. Thanks.

214
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:47,022
我只是想说
I just wanted to say that...

215
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,004
我们今晚谈谈
We'll talk tonight,

216
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:55,084
但是我想说
But I wanted to say that

217
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:01,076
我不知道昨天是怎么回事
I'm not exactly sure who that was yesterday,

218
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,024
但那不是我本意
But it wasn't me.

219
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,047
对不起
I'm sorry.

220
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,056
我爱你
Love you.

221
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:07,015
我只是想说
I just wanted to say that...

222
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:10,098
我们今晚谈谈
We'll talk tonight,

223
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:14,088
-但是我想说  -你好啊
- But I wanted to say that... - Hey, there.

224
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:18,087
-谁带的吉拿棒[类似油条]  -我带的
- Who brought the churros? - That would be me.

225
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:21,004
如果放在家里  
If I leave them at home, I'll wind

226
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:22,055
我会一个人全吃掉  所以
Up eating them myself. So...

227
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,027
其实是剩下的
They're actually leftovers.

228
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:28,088
我们给沃尔特开了个小聚会
We had a little get-together for Walt.

229
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,002
不是他生日  对吧
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

230
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:33,037
实际上
Actually,

231
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,055
沃尔特他
Walt's got...

232
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:42,007
他一直在...与癌症斗争
He's been... battling cancer.

233
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,002
上周我们收到了好消息
And last week, we got good news.

234
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,066
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

235
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,006
但我们很乐观的
But we're really optimistic.

236
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:51,004
太好了
Great.

237
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,067
有好消息太好了
Good news is great.

238
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,058
是啊  确实是
Yeah, it is. It really is.

239
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,062
欢迎随时带好吃的来
Feel free to bring these any time.

240
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,033
我们这可有不少好东西
Got some real beauts.

241
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:27,032
C3型的加热效率是最高的
You cannot beat the thermal efficiency of the C3.

242
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,097
那么  无水箱的怎么样
Then again, what about tankless?

243
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,084
当然  我们有货
Sure. We got them.

244
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,011
不过好东西价钱也高
The good ones will really run up your price though.

245
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:42,082
你得多掏差不多一千二
Set you back about 1,200.

246
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:46,003
钱不是问题
It's not an issue.

247
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:51,058
需要上门安装的吧
You want installation, right?

248
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:53,041
不用  我自己装
No. I'm gonna do it myself?

249
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:56,079
真高兴听你这么说
That's what I like to hear.

250
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,041
还有这是谁  他还能无板冲浪吗
And who's this? This guy can surf without a board?

251
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,066
那是飞人
That's hover man.

252
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,060
他会冲浪  滑冰  滑翔
He can surf, skate, glide,

253
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,092
无所不能  因为他的双脚
Whatever, 'cause he's always got a

254
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:21,000
能喷射6英寸的空气流
6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

255
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:23,053
好酷  线条不错
That's cool. Great lines.

256
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:31,006
那这人又是谁  他有什么超能力
And this guy? What's his superpower?

257
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:33,098
这是袋鼠人
That's kanga man.

258
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:37,002
袋鼠人  半人半袋鼠吗
Kanga man. Half man, half kangaroo?

259
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:39,058
他袋子里的是谁
And who's this in his pouch?

260
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,053
他的小伙伴乔伊
His sidekick Joey.

261
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:45,008
他坐在袋子里到处行侠仗义
He rides around in his pouch and, you know,

262
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,011
打击犯罪
Fights crime.

263
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:50,015
这么说袋鼠人是女的
So that makes kanga-man a she.

264
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:52,077
你知道的  对吧
You know that, right?

265
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,071
只有母袋鼠才有袋子
Only female kangaroos have pouches.

266
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:57,042
对  我知道
Yeah.I know.

267
00:22:57,072 --> 00:23:00,019
但你知道  这绝对是个男的
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

268
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:02,055
他是经实验改造过的
He's a product of experimentation.

269
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:05,072
他很性感呢  臀型很好
He's kind of hot, I guess. Nice haunches.

270
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,014
还有这个呢
And this is?

271
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:12,016
这个是倒行人
It's Backwardo.

272
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:16,023
不对  等等  我更名叫逆行人了 
Wait, no. I actually changed it to Rewindo.

273
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:18,057
总之  他倒退着走路
Anyways, he goes backwards.

274
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:20,040
他能让所有东西倒退着走
He can make everything go in reverse.

275
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,085
让时间倒退吗  像时空旅行那样
Time and stuff? Like time traveling?

276
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:25,040
不是   他就是倒着走路而已
No, he just walks backwards.

277
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:27,072
他倒着走路
He walks backwards.

278
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:31,051
这也算超能力吗  有什么用处
Is that a superpower? What good is that?

279
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:34,037
他能倒走走得很快
He does it, like, really fast.

280
00:23:35,006 --> 00:23:37,089
比如有人拿着把刀对着他的时候  对吧
Look, say someone's coming at him with a knife. Right?

281
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:41,000
这就有用了  他就能倒退着逃得远远的
It's helpful.Then he can just zip backwards away from them.

282
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:47,034
我画这些的时候  还很小
I was a kid,when I drew all these.

283
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:49,092
差不多4年前的事了
It was, like, four years ago.

284
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:52,069
他们看起来跟你很像
They all look like you.

285
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:56,064
画里的人都是你
It's you in all of these.

286
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:02,089
真想知道心理医生见了这些会怎么说
I wonder what a shrink would say if he saw them.

287
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:04,048
少来了
Shut up.

288
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:07,032
好像你从不希望能拥有超能力一样
Like you never wanted a superpower.

289
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:17,032
是有人在敲你的门还是我的
Is that your door or mine?

290
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:18,059
我不知道
I don't know.

291
00:24:20,055 --> 00:24:22,008
好像是我的
It sounds like mine.

292
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,042
我得走了
I gotta go.

293
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,051
去哪
Where?

294
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,007
去哪
Where?

295
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,081

00:25:19,078 --> 00:25:20,078
老爸
Hey, dad.

299
00:25:21,023 --> 00:25:22,043
总算开门了
There you are.

300
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:24,017
宝贝
Hi, honey.

301
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:27,091
看到你车在  所以我相信你肯定在家
I saw your car, so I was pretty sure you were home.

302
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:30,094
抱歉  我在工作  带着耳机呢
Sorry. I was working. I had my headphones on.

303
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:34,026
终于意识到这不是鼓点声了
Finally realized that I wasn't the drum track?

304
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:35,061
是啊
Exactly.

305
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:38,020
我正好在附近
I was in the neighborhood.

306
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,096
想问你要不要跟我一起吃午餐去
Was wondering if you wanted to have some lunch

307
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,019
当然好

308
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,020
-这是你爸爸吗  -是的

这是新房客

唐纳德
Donald.

311
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,025
不好意思  有事找我吗
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

312
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:05,047
没有
No.

313
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:08,094
老爸  进屋坐吧  见到你太高兴了
Dad, why don't you come in? It was nice seeing you.

314
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:11,051
-很高兴见到你  -我也是

Hey, dad.

316
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:46,018

-提早放学回家了  -对
- Are you home early? - Yeah

318
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:51,021
老天
Oh, man.

319
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:55,012
今天过得还好吗

现在好了  总算有热水了
Now it is. Finally, hot water.

321
00:26:58,023 --> 00:26:59,057
不用再用有毒废水了
No more toxic waste.

322
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:02,004
是啊  的确是

325
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,056
想试试看吗
Want to take her for a spin?

326
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:14,023
你去厨房水槽边等着怎么样
Listen, why don't you go to the kitchen sink?

327
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:17,080
到了说一声  我再知会你
Let me know when you're ready, and I'll give you a holler.

328
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:23,002
指示灯  打开
The pilot... in.

329
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:25,063
点火  成了
Ignition. Bingo.

330
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:29,047
准备
Ready!

331
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,035
好了好了  放水吧
All right. Let her rip!

Sounds really good, dad.

336
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:54,041
还有节能装置
And the energy savings.

337
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:56,054
小心  小心  小心
Careful, careful, careful.

338
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,022
可能还需要调整一下
There's probably some adjustments

339
00:27:58,022 --> 00:27:59,068
我会搞定的  你没事吧
I need to make there. Are you ok?

340
00:28:00,014 --> 00:28:01,014
没事
I'm fine.

341
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:08,055
儿子  昨天的事...
Son, about yesterday...

342
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,014
抱歉我吐在泳池里了
I'm sorry about the pool.

343
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:16,073
这不是你的错  你一点都没错
That was not your fault. Not at all.

344
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,092
是你老爸自己丢人了
Your old man embarrassed himself,

345
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:25,064
我为自己的行为感到羞愧
And I'm not very proud of my behavior.

346
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:28,069
不得不说  我真觉得自己很蠢
I have to say I feel very foolish.

347
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:35,077
你和汉克姨父好像闹僵了
You and uncle Hank, you seemed pissed off.

348
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,079
我们没事的  一切都很好
We're fine. Everything's fine.

349
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:43,071
今天早上我打电话跟他道过歉了
I called him this morning and made my apologies.

350
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:49,037
但是  儿子  其实我最该道歉的人是你
But, son, I owe you an apology most of all.

351
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:53,090
我该考虑得更周全些
I should have used better judgment all around.

352
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:58,029
一开始让你喝酒  就是错的
Having you drink in the first place, it was not right,

353
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:00,033
对此我非常抱歉
And for that I'm very sorry.

354
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,077
但我一直在喝  对吧
But I kept up, right?

355
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:06,047
你和汉克叔叔...
You and uncle Hank.

356
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:08,043
我喝了三杯
I drank three.

357
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:18,019
我去把工具放放好
I have some tools to put away.

358
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,041
晚点想去看电影吗
You want to catch a movie later?

359
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:36,099
刚刚那是怎么回事
What was that all about?

360
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,020
什么
What?

361
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:41,044
刚才  你爸来的时候
Before. With your dad.

362
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:45,027
没什么呀
It wasn't about anything.

363
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:50,085
这么说完全是我误解了吗
So I totally just misread your total dis?

364
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:53,023
如果有什么  那也是我帮了你一个忙
If anything, I was doing you a favor.

365
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
帮忙
A favor?

366
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,057
我跟你提过  他是个凶悍的人
I told you.He's a hard-ass.

367
00:30:58,012 --> 00:31:00,078
-他看起来对我挺和善  -额  好吧
- He seemed cool to me. - Yeah, well...

368
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:04,039
-到底怎么回事  -没什么事
- So what's the deal? - There's no deal.

369
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:07,026
我是在帮你  好吗  保护你
I was helping you out, okay? Protecting you.

370
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,081
-怎么说  -我是说
- How's that?  - I mean,

371
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:14,087
我让你这儿抽烟  随心所欲
I'm letting you smoke in here and everything.

372
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,011
我买了滤嘴
I bought a filter.

373
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:19,099
我觉得他知道得越少  对你越好
And I figured the less he knows, the better.

374
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:22,076
你刚表现的好像不认识我
You acted like you didn't even know me.

375
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:28,008
-所以  -你觉得我该表现的像
- So?  - You think I'm going to be all like,

376
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,053
"老爸  这是住隔壁的吸毒男
"Dad, meet the stoner guy who lives next door.

377
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:32,090
"顺便说一句  我跟他睡过"
"And by the way, I'm sleeping with him"?

378
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:35,065
你就这么想的吗
That's all you think you're doing?

379
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,068
-为什么你这么介意我老爸  -我才没有呢
- Why do you even care about my dad? - I don't!

380
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,099
很好  那我就不知道为啥还要谈论这个
Good. Then I don't know why we're talking about it.

381
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:44,054
我们  好吗  我说的是我们
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

382
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:45,072
我们
Us.

383
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:49,054
你和我
You and me.

384
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,079
你和我算是谁
Who's you and me?

385
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,074
我出去下
I'm out of here.

386
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:04,077
老爸
Dad?

387
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,070
怎么了
What?

388
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:12,077
-你在干什么  -我们家烂了
- What are you doing? - We've got rot.

389
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,012
烂了
Rot?

390
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,088
我指给你看  这儿
I'll show you. Here.

391
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,000
好好看看
Take a look at that.

392
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:22,082
看见了没
See that?

393
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:24,078
之前见过吗
Ever seen anything like it?

394
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:28,049
-只是块木头  -是木头
- It's wood. - It's wood

395
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:30,058
上面却有很多子实体
that contains fruiting bodies.

396
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,050
子什么
Fruity what?

397
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,075
真菌  而且已经爆发了
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

398
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,041
我真看不出有什么
I don't really see anything.

399
00:34:38,096 --> 00:34:40,028
就这在那儿  
Well, it's there.

400
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:41,097
你得从哪看  这儿
You just have to know where to look. Here.

401
00:34:42,064 --> 00:34:44,059
然后你把它们都锯掉
Then you cut it all out.

402
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:47,022
你把它们锯掉  然后换上新的
You just cut it out and start fresh.

403
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:50,043
我得继续了
Well, better get to it.

404
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:55,009
整间屋子都会倒塌吗
Is the whole house gonna collapse or something?

405
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,060
如果锯掉这些那就不会了
Not if I can help it.

406
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:28,061
你打算升职吗  这么卖力干活  该回家了
You bucking for a promotion? Go home already.

407
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:30,027
我马上走
I will.

408
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:35,048
能问下
Can I just ask...

409
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:39,032
凯勒公司的账户吗
the Keller account.

410
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:40,041
凯勒公司的账户
Keller account...

411
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:43,019
在这张资产负债表里被列为流动资产
It's listed as a Current Asset on this balance sheet,

412
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,050
但是应收账款里
but the invoice was never presented to

413
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,099
却从没有该项发票  所以
accounts Receivable, so.

414
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:49,031
老天
God.

415
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:51,002
总有一天我都得把
One of these days I'm going to have to sort through

416
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:52,071
老爸的业务分下类
all the Dad stuff.

417
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,093
他总是有很多和小公司的业务往来 
He had so many "Don't worry about it, pay me Friday"

418
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:58,044
诸如"别担心  周五结清"
Relationships with these little companies.

419
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,078
明天再解决吧
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

420
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,075
也许还搞不定
Or not.

421
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:04,011
好的
Right.

422
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,081
说真的  你不会想让我把你锁在这儿吧
Seriously, you're not gonna make me lock you in, are you?

423
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,039
我没事
I'm fine.

424
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:25,049
荷尔蒙的关系  老实说  最近老这样
It's hormones. Honestly. It happens all the time.

425
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,020
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

426
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,025
怎么了
What's wrong?

427
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:42,083
我猜只是
I guess it just

428
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:48,098
感觉一切如常
doesn't feel any different.

429
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:54,078
那个
The...

430
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,011
好消息
good news?

431
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,034
我是说
I mean,

432
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:01,091
没有任何改变
nothing's really changed.

433
00:37:04,031 --> 00:37:05,081
只是延期了而已
It's just postponed.

434
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,029
隧道的尽头应该会有光线
There was supposed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.

435
00:37:12,016 --> 00:37:13,003
但
But...

436
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,065
最近  感觉就像
lately, it just feels like...

437
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,017
隧道没有尽头
More tunnel.

438
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:23,011
抱歉
I'm sorry.

439
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:32,035
我感觉自己太忘恩负义了
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

440
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,059
我不知道
I don't know.

441
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,085
对我来说  只是感冒
For me, it was the flu.

442
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:39,038
什么
What?

443
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:41,096
我老爸去世前精神抖擞
My dad rallied at the end.

444
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:44,049
我是说  也不是沃尔特这样的好消息
I mean, it wasn't the full-on good news Walt got,

445
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,031
情况不同  但我们高兴坏了
Different circumstances, but we were happy,

446
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,013
简直欣喜若狂
we were over the moon.

447
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:52,046
就在那个时候  我病了
And right then, I got sick.

448
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:55,068
流感  萎了好几天
Flu. Boom. Knocked me on my ass for days.

449
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:58,049
下不了床  动不了
Couldn't get out of bed, couldn't move.

450
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:00,049
很巧吧
Great timing.

451
00:38:03,018 --> 00:38:06,024
我都没把这俩事放一块  
And I wasn't even putting two and two together.

452
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:07,000
只是想
I was just thinking,

453
00:38:07,013 --> 00:38:08,023
为何是现在
Why now?

454
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:13,027
死撑着
Being that rock...

455
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,058
死撑着只会让你失去一切
Being that rock takes everything you got.

456
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:19,071
你今天还去工作吗
Are you going to work today?

457
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:24,004
斯凯勒  那儿烂了
Skyler, there's rot.

458
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:35,011
我回去忙了
I work back

459
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:43,003
道歉娃娃
Apology Girl

460
00:42:22,077 --> 00:42:23,058
该死
Damn!

461
00:42:26,054 --> 00:42:28,014
-我真是笨手笨脚  -我来拣吧
- Clumsy. - I got it.

462
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:30,071
你不必这样
You don't have to do that.

463
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:59,015
你买错火柴了
You're buying the wrong matches.

464
00:43:59,087 --> 00:44:03,005
-什么  -这些火柴  品种不对
- What? - Those matches. They're the wrong kind.

465
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:06,088
红磷应该从火柴盒擦条带上划得
Red phosphorous is found in the striker strips,

466
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:08,089
不该在火柴上的
Not the matches themselves.

467
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:10,099
你要买200根
You need to get the big 200-count box of

468
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:12,069
独立装的火柴
Individual matchbooks.

469
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,086
有更多的擦条带  明白吗
More striker strips. You understand?

470
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,040
这些火柴才一个擦条带
Those only have the one.

471
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,036
还有别在一个地方买所有东西
And don't buy everything in one place.

472
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,013
零碎着买
Do it piecemeal.

473
00:44:26,032 --> 00:44:28,052
不同的商店采购不同的东西
Different items, different stores.

474
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,035
减少注意力
Attracts less attention.

475
00:44:33,054 --> 00:44:35,008
听懂我说的了吗
Are you following me here?

476
00:45:36,092 --> 00:45:38,090
就是他  那个家伙
There he is. That's the guy.

477
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,038
滚出我地盘
Stay out of my territory.
