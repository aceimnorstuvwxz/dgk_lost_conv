00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:57,070
-你简直是救命恩人  -是啊  伙计
- You are a life saver.  - Yeah, man.

12
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:00,029
-我们实在太感激你了  -太感谢了
- We can't thank you enough.  - Hey, mad props.

13
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,042
我发誓那人说的是往南面开
I could have sworn the guy said south.

14
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:04,058
但是突然一下我们就离开了大路
But then, all of a sudden we're off the main road.

15
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:06,058
我想边开车边看地图
I'm trying to read the map while I'm driving,

16
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,096
实在是个愚蠢的行为
which is a bonehead maneuver.

17
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:11,028
忽然"砰"的一声  我们就掉进了沟里
And all of a sudden... Bang, we're in that ditch.

18
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:14,003
对 "砰"  我还搞不清楚发生了什么
Yeah, bam, I'm like, what the hell? You know?

19
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,002
对了  还有我的咖啡杯
Yes, and my coffee mug.

20
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:18,003
咖啡  我的咖啡杯
Coffee? My mug of coffee?

21
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:21,042
全洒在我裤子上  简直就是恶梦
It spills all over my pants. I mean, just... a nightmare.

22
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:24,038
伙计  说真的  你该装个GPS导航仪
Dude, you so need GPS. I mean, for real.

23
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,013
就像我说的
Like I said,

24
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,018
我们对你感激涕零
we couldn't be more grateful.

25
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:09,033
难道就不能把他们扔这儿吗
Can't we just dump them here?

26
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,035
什么  等着别人发现他们吗
What, then somebody finds them?

27
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,051
那时怎么办  已经有人看见我们了
Then what? People have seen us.

28
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,046
你得把车子沉到河里  伙计
You're gonna flood it, man.

29
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,084
我不会把车沉到河里的  它不能沉  懂吗
I'm not gonna flood it. She's not going to flood, all right?

30
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:27,090
我们得乐观点  明白吗
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

31
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:31,017
我们要收拾好这烂摊子  希望能发动起来
We're going to clean up this mess. Wish you would start.

32
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,037
该死的  看见没  她已经进过水了
Damn it. See? You flooded it.

33
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:37,028
好吧  好吧  你知道吗
All right. All right. You know what?

34
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,059
车子会发动起来的
The RV is going to start now.

35
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,089
车子会马上发动起来的
The RV is going to start right now.

36
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,032
发动起来以后
It's gonna start and we're gonna

37
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:44,057
我们就开去你家
drive it over to your house.

38
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:48,044
我们把它开过去停一个晚上
We're gonna drive it over there and park it overnight.

39
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:50,077
-然后明天一早  -不行  不能去我家
- And then tomorrow...  - No, man, not my house!

40
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,058
闭嘴
Shut up!

41
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:08,091
收拾好这烂摊子后
After we finish cleaning up this mess,

42
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,020
你走你的阳关道  我过我的独木桥
We will go our separate ways.

43
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,049
从此井水不犯河水
Our paths will never cross.

44
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,094
天知地知你知我知
And we will tell this to no one.

45
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:18,072
明白吗
Understood?

46
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,032
我现在能说话了吗
What, I can talk now?

47
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,075
好吧
Fine.

48
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,024
你都已经替我说完了
That goes double for me.

49
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:36,079
很好  争气点
Okay, okay. Be good to me.

50
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:44,027
成了
Yes!

51
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,059
很好  很棒
Yes, ok, ok.

52
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,039
该死
Oh, shit.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,050
绝

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,050
命

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,050
毒

沃尔特

60
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,008
你出来吗
You coming out?

61
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,040
当然
Yeah, absolutely.

62
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,093
想听趣事吗
You wanna hear something funny?

63
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,011
上周四  我们开了教工大会
We had a faculty meeting last thursday

64
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:21,020
内容有关毕业生留影
And the topic was senior class photos,

65
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:24,066
去年我们定了新规定
and how we had instituted a new rule last year

66
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,072
允许毕业生
that seniors are allowed to

67
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:29,086
选择喜欢的摄影师来拍摄毕业照
have photos taken by a photographer of their choice,

68
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,020
不一定
you know, not necessarily

69
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,088
用学校雇的摄影师
the photographer that the school hires.

70
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,083
所以
That's so --

71
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:40,033
总之  有些毕业班的女生们
So, anyway, some of the senior girls

72
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,012
前往
were going to that...

73
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,092
高级的摄影棚拍毕业照
glamour shots place, to have their photos taken,

74
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:49,004
结果等她们拿来了所有照片
and now they're bringing us all these photos,

75
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,024
琼· 埃普曼  你认识的
and Joan Epperman, you know Joan,

76
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,004
突然发现照片都拍出她们乳沟了
suddenly has to go through all these photos

77
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:57,059
所以得仔细检查  然后退回去
and turn them down, because they show cleavage.

78
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:03,016
亲爱的  还要薄饼吗
Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie?

79
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,054
不用了  我饱了
Yeah. I'm good.

80
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:11,063
甚至那些平胸的姑娘  都有乳沟
You know, even these small-busted girls... have cleavage.

81
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:15,069
很明显  现在有种新型的胸罩
Apparently there's some new type of brassiere,

82
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,050
或是别的玩意
or something.

83
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,026
神奇胸罩
The wonderbra...

84
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:23,016
那叫神奇胸罩
It's the wonderbra.

85
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,005
是吗  好的
Yeah? OK.

86
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,048

Hey, there. You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter Junior.

我们现在不能接电话
We can't come to the phone right now,

88
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,061
请留言
so please leave us a message.

89
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,087
你好  怀特先生  这里是美国电话电报公司
Hello, Mr. White. This is AT&T calling.

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,024
您对您现在的长途电话服务满意吗
Are you happy with your current long distance service?

91

你好  我是沃尔特·怀特
Hello? Hello, hello. This is Walter White speaking.

94
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:55,026
你不是说他已经死了吗
You said he was practically dead, okay?

95
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,031
你还说他马上就会死
You said he would die any minute!

96
00:07:57,031 --> 00:08:00,084
听着  我正在和我的家人吃早餐
Listen, I am having breakfast with my family right now,

97
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:03,030
我真的不太喜欢这些推销电话
and I really don't appreciate these sales calls.

98
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,029
太糟糕了  伙计  猜猜发生了什么
Well, too bad, man, 'cause guess what.

99
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,062
他还没死
He's still not dead!

100
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:10,094
我把耳朵贴在车上  就能听到
I went and put my ear to the RV, I can hear him, like,

101
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:12,011
他在里面滚来滚去的声音
rolling around in there, all right?

102
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:16,003
我想他醒了  大概想要松绑
I think he's awake, man. I think he's trying to get loose.

103
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:18,041
你到底在哪里  我在这里快疯了
Where the hell are you? I'm freaking out over here!

104
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,000
-该死的 冷静下来  -你会帮我收拾残局吗
- Calm down, damn it.  - Are you gonna help me clean this up?

105
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:23,087
-这事还没完呢  -冷静
- We've got loose ends here!  - Calm down!

106
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:26,036
放学以后我会过去的
I will be there after school.

107
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:28,082
放学后  你在敷衍我吗
After school? Are you shitting me?

108
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,093
别上班了  打电话请假
Ditch it, man, call in sick.

109
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:34,003
听着  对我说什么都没用
Listen, that is just not going to work for me.

110
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:35,024
我完全不感兴趣
I'm not interested in that at all.

111
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:38,054
希望你不要再打来了
And I would appreciate if you don't call here anymore.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,007
可恶  这些人可真是烦
Damn. They're so annoying, those people.

113
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,092
-过得开心  宝贝  -好的  妈妈  你也一样
- You have a good day, sweetie.  - Okay, mom, you too.

114
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,086
再见  亲爱的
Bye, honey.

115
00:08:56,064 --> 00:08:58,097
-开车当心点  -好的
- Drive safe.  - Okay.

116
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,088
唷  唷  唷  148-3369
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,

117
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,080
代表阿尔布开克
representing the ABQ.

118
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:18,037
何事  贱人
What up, biatch?

119
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,042
提示音后留话
Leave it at the tone.

120
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,073
"手性"这个术语
So, the term "chiral"

121
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:42,032
来源于希腊语的"手"
derives from the Greek word "hand".

122
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:47,019
它在化学中的概念是  就如同你的左手
And the concept here being that, just as your left hand,

123
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:51,075
和你的右手互为镜像
and your right hand are mirror images of one another, right?

124
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,089
相同而又对立
Identical, and yet opposite.

125
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:57,080
所以  有机化合物
Well, so too organic compounds can exist as

126
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,086
总是以互为镜像的形式
mirror image forms

127
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:02,094
存在于分子水平上
of one another all the way down at the molecular level.

128
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,051
虽然看似相似
But although they may look the same,

129
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:10,022
但是生物活性不尽相同
they don't always behave the same.

130
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:11,034
比如说
For instance...

131
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:15,083
比如说
For instance...

132
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,083
抱歉  比如说
I'm sorry... for instance...

133
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,047
酞胺哌啶酮[镇静剂]
Thalidomide.

134
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:27,025
这种药物的右旋异构体
The right-handed isomer of the drug thalidomide

135
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,074
是一种很有效的药物
is a perfectly fine good medicine

136
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:31,010
用于减轻
to give to a pregnant woman

137
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:33,078
孕妇晨吐的症状  但是
to prevent morning sickness. But,

138
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:37,054
如果给孕妇错服了
make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman

00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:41,007
酞咪脈啶酮的左旋异构体
the left-handed isomer of the drug thalidomide,

140
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,064
那么她生出的婴儿
and her child will be born with

141
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:46,036
将会严重畸形
horrible birth defects.

142
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,057
此等事件曾在上个世纪50年代发生过
Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s.

143
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:55,073
那么  手性的  手性
So, chiral, chirality,

144
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:58,025
镜像  懂了吗
mirrored images, right?

145
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,097
一个有活性  一个没有活性
Active, inactive.

146
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,072
一好一坏
Good, bad.

147
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,032
本  请讲
Yes, Ben?

148
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:10,085
这个会出现在凶杀案里吗
Is this gonna be on the murder?

149
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:14,086
什么
What?

150
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,052
期中考试会考吗(沃尔特听错了)
Is this gonna be on the mid-term?

151
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,029
期中考试会不会考手性  不会  也许
The chirality on the mid-term? No, no, well, maybe,

152
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,082
也许会  对
maybe, yes, you know, but prepare

153
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,068
要做好出现在期中考里的准备
for it to be on the mid-term.

154
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,098
多知道一点也没损失  不是吗
Can't hurt to know it, right?

155
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:32,000
知识就是力量
Knowledge is power!

156
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:50,005
不  不
Oh, no, no...

157
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:00,067
不妙了  不妙了
Not good. Not good.

158
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,091
怎么
What the...

159
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:45,060
你  你
Hey, hey, you, you, hey.

160
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,085
听着  别  别  别
Listen... No, no, no, no!

161
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:53,024
上帝啊
Oh, God!

162
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:59,021
辣妈性爱
MILF's?

163
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,035
辣妈性爱是什么鬼东西
What the hell is a MILF?

164
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:22,053
现在怎么办
Now what?

165
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:30,036
另一个  在车里的  他
The other one, out in the RV, he's...

166
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:33,006
-你确定  -是的
- You're sure?  - Yes.

167
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,052
-不然你自己去看好了  -对  真是个好主意
- You know what, feel free to go check it yourself.  - Yes, good idea.

168
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:37,095
也许我该在他晃悠到大街上之前
Maybe I should do that before he

169
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:39,051
亲自去察看一下
do wanders off down the damn street.

170
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:42,024
-你知道吗  我  -行了  行了
- Okay, you know what, I...  - All right, all right!

171
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,050
楼下的那位  说说他的情况
The one downstairs, tell me about him.

172
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:48,086
快点  什么都可以  说点什么
Come on, anything, something!

173
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,066
-至少可以先说名字  -疯狂小八
- Start with his name, at least!  - Krazy-8.

174
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,024
疯狂小八  这到底什么鬼意思
Krazy-8? What the hell does that even mean?

175
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:57,023
我不知道好吗  他就像个疯子
I don't know, man, okay? I mean, he's like,

176
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:59,071
行了吗  我也不知道
Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

177
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:02,057
那你经常跟他合伙吗
So, you work with him regularly?

178
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:04,073
不  跟他合作得不多
No, not him so much.

179
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:07,037
-主要是跟他表弟  -他表弟是谁
- His cousin, mainly.  - Who's his cousin?

180
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:10,030
-车里的那个  -行了  行了
- The guy out in the RV!  - All right, all right.

181
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:12,062
疯狂小八比他高一等级
Krazy-8's one level higher.

182
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:15,042
高一等级
One level higher?

183
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,041
对  不是街头混混水平
Yeah, you know, not like street level.

184
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,084
更高一级
Higher.

185
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:21,095
就好比到处都有星巴克
You know, there's like a starbucks at every corner?

186
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,044
疯狂小八  就是卖给星巴克咖啡豆的人
Krazy-8 is, like, the dude that sells starbucks his beans.

187
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:27,080
好吧  所以他算经销商
Okay, so he's a distributor.

188
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,080
好吧  那么  他
Okay, so, is he...

189
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:34,043
我是说  他是不是  换句话说
I mean, is he... in other words...

190
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:37,000
他是不是暴力狂
What is his reputation for violence?

191
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:40,060
这个
Well, um...

192
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:43,082
他昨天想要杀了我们  所以应该是吧
He did try to kill us both yesterday, so there's that.

193
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:47,005
我想说的是  他是个经销商  对吧
What I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor, right?

194
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,033
他是  他是商人  生意人
He's a... He's a businessman, he's a man of business.

195
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,071
也就是说
It would therefore seem to follow

196
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,009
他可能不会
that he is capable of acting

197
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,072
表现地那么狭隘  对吗
out of mutual self-interest, yes?

198
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:58,052
什么
What?

199
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:01,025
你觉得他这个人
Do you think he is capable

200
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,071
听得进道理吗
of listening to reason?

201
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,031
什么道理
What kind of reason?

202
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:08,005
像是  亲爱的疯狂小八  听好
You mean like "Dear krazy-8, listen,

203
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:09,019
如果我放你走  你能保证
if I let you go, will you promise not

204
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,018
不回来杀我全家
to come back and waste my entire family,

205
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:13,090
不砍我脑袋  你是说这种道理吗
no colombian neckties." you mean that kind of reason?

206
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:15,077
不  伙计  我可不敢说
No, man, I can't say as I have

207
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:17,076
我他妈的对他寄予如此大的厚望
high fuck hopes as that concern.

208
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,052
什么声音
What was that?

209
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:28,017
怎么了
What was what?

210
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:34,039
来看啊
Come!

211
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,020
我们得把他绑起来
We gotta tie him up.

212
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,064
咱们刚刚怎么没绑着他呢
Why the hell didn't we tie him up?

213
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:42,003
因为他昏过去了
Because he was out cold.

214
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,029
可要是他是装的呢
But what if he's faking it?

215
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:48,001
换做是我  肯定会装成给打晕了
Like if it was me, I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo!

216
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,069
然后  等到危险过去了
And then, when the coast is clear,

217
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:53,011
再起来找武器
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit,

218
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:54,078
等机会突袭
waiting to pounce!

219
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,000
如果现在换做是我
Now if it was me, and I couldn't

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,070
找不到件称心的武器
find a decent like weapon

221
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,091
我就会躺回去  再等时机
I would just lie back down, and bide my time.

222
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,009
那我们现在做什么
So now what do we do?

223
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:29,088
你老问我
You keep asking me that

224
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:33,036
好像我心里有底似的
like you think I have some answer.

225
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,094
-你总得做点什么吧  -是我们
- Well, you gotta do something! - We!

226
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:40,043
我们得做点什么  我愿意听听你的建议
We have got to do something, and I am opened to suggestions.

227
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:42,089
伙计  整件事都是你搞出来的
Man, uh-uh, okay, this whole thing was your deal!

228
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:45,003
你怎么能赖到我头上呢
Don't you dare put that on me!

229
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:47,022
是你把这些人带出来
You brought those guys out there,

230
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:48,055
全是你的错
this is your responsibility.

231
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:51,019
说的像是我找到你  求着给你制毒似的
Like I came to you, begging to cook meth.

232
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,012
像我跟你说  书呆子老伙计啊
"Nerdiest old dude I know,

233
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:55,056
你想来做点儿纯冰毒吧
you wanna come cook crystal please."

234
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:57,088
我得问问我那穿着纸尿裤的奶奶
"I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny,

235
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,069
可是她的轮椅进不了旅行车
but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV."

236
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:09,091
那气化磷酸盐怎么办
What about the... the phosphate gas?

237
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:12,052
气化磷酸盐  怎么了
Phosphine gas. What about it?

238
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:15,047
我是说  你觉得气化磷酸盐还可能杀死他吗
I mean, do you think it still might kill him?

239
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:18,018
比如延迟反应之类的
You know, with like a delayed reaction or something?

240
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:21,089
我不清楚
I don't know.

241
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,070
-你可是个科学家啊  -听着
- You're supposed to be a scientist! - Look!

242
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,046
这不是我们现在该考虑的
This isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention.

243
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,070
旅行车里还有具尸体呢
We have got a body in that RV,

244
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:34,028
天气开始变得炎热  明白我意思吗
and it's getting warmer outside, understand?

245
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,053
我们得赶快采取行动
And we have got to do something about that soon.

246
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,004
用某种方法使得人不知鬼不觉
And in a way that no one will ever find it.

247
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:42,039
最后我要说的
Now that last part

248
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,007
非常  非常重要
is very, very important.

249
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:46,073
那就是
Therefore,

250
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,098
我们的最佳策略
it seems to me that our best course of action

251
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:55,035
应该是化学消融法
would be chemical disincorporation.

252
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:01,082
让他在强酸里溶解掉
Dissolving in strong acid.

253
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:11,021
伙计  我有点混乱
Oh man, that's messed up.

254
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:15,035
你不是  你不是说真的吧
You're not... you're not serious?

255
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:19,076
你说真的
You're serious?

256
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:28,088
谁来动手
Who's gonna do that?

257
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:30,089
别看我
And don't look at me!

258
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,049
我猜咱俩得一起干
I guess we'll both do it together.

259
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:38,071
不行  怀特先生  我搞不定尸体
No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not good with dead bodies.

260
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:43,042
咱俩是拴在一条绳上的蚂蚱  懂吗
We're in this 50/50, okay?

261
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,044
我猜还有一个公平的办法
I guess the only other fair way

262
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:51,007
那就是
to go about this would be...

263
00:21:52,026 --> 00:21:55,042
其中一人去处理
That one of us deals with the...

264
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:59,030
尸体的问题  另外一个去
body situation, while the other one of us...

265
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:02,096
处理疯狂小八那事儿
deals with the Krazy-8 situation.

266
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,034
事已至此
In a scenario like this,

267
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:15,057
我想  除了抛硬币
I don't suppose it is bad form to just...

268
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,065
也别无他法了
flip a coin.

269
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:29,099
-猜正反  -我去用酸处理尸体  好吧
- Heads or tails? - I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

270
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:32,047
正面还是反面
Heads or tails?

271
00:22:40,078 --> 00:22:43,090
正面  我猜正面
Heads. Heads.

272
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,039
还是三局两胜吧
Best two out of three?

273
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,057
唷  唷  唷  148-3369
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,

274
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,026
代表阿尔布开克
representing the ABQ.

275
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,078
何事  贱人
What up, biatch?

276
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,000
提示音后留言
Leave it at the tone.

277
00:23:31,057 --> 00:23:33,028
怀特先生  是我  接电话啊
Mr. White, it's me, pick up.

278
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:36,020
我找不到合适的容器
I got a container question.

279
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,015
喂  怀特先生  接电话啊
Hello? Mr. White, pick up the phone, man!

280
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,052
是我
Yes?

281
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,087
得用哪种塑料  伙计
What kind of plastic, man?

282
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:46,064
聚乙烯
Polyethylene.

283
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:49,076
我要怎么分辨
How the hell am I supposed to know that?

284
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:51,051
我告诉过你
Because I told you.

285
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:52,084
听着
Look, just...

286
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:57,076
看底下  会有个三角形
Look at the bottom for a triangle

287
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,092
印着"低密度聚乙烯"
stamped "LDPE".

288
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:02,094
应该是模压在塑料里的
It should be molded right into the plastic.

289
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,092
恩  恩  低密度聚乙烯  对  找到了
Yeah, yeah, LDPE. Right on, got it.

290
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:10,020
我不好说  伙计  可这玩意儿看起来很脆弱
But... I don't know, man, this feels kind of flimsy.

291
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:12,079
随便哪种像样的酸  都能把这腐蚀穿的
Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this.

292
00:24:12,094 --> 00:24:15,052
-氢氟酸就不会  -为啥
- Not hydrofluoric.  - Why not?

293
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:20,056
听着  你不是
Look, you skipped,

294
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,070
翘了所有课去胡闹了
clowned around or otherwise jerked off

295
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,010
就是去自慰了
to every lecture I ever gave.

296
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:29,063
在我看来  你的化学学习生涯已经结束了
As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over.

297
00:24:29,078 --> 00:24:31,088
行了  别鸡巴废话了
Oh, okay. Be a dick about it.

298
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:36,028
你有没有
So, hey, have you...

299
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,075
把活儿干完
Have you done the thing?

300
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:47,087
恩  我正着手做呢
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

301
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:54,026
你猜怎么着  我打赌他都没醒过来
You know what? I bet he doesn't even wake up.

302
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:58,098
即便你现在把他送医院  也不会醒的
Not even if you took him to the hospital right now.

303
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,065
要是我的话
Now, if it was me, I would

304
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:02,093
就会试着去想
just try and think of

305
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:06,042
自己只是在帮他忙
I was doing him a favor.

306
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:20,020
是谁
Who's there?

307
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:26,053
你他妈的别想玩我  是谁
Don't you fucking play games with me. Who's there?

308
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:33,068
我可看见你了
Yeah, I see you.

309
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,019
你想要干什么
What are you gonna do?

310
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:52,044
我要喝水
I need water!

311
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:58,093
你能不能给我点水喝
Bring me some water, would you?

312
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:02,054
求你了
Please?

313
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,087
你不喜欢吃面包皮吗
You don't like the crust?

314
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:33,063
我表弟埃米利奥呢
Where's my cousin Emilio?

315
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:39,062
他死了吗
He dead?

316
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,089
怀特先生
Hey, Mr. White!

317
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:38,026
怀特先生
Hey, Mr. White!

318
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,064
你在抽大麻吗
Are you smoking weed?

319
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:47,039
我的天啊
Oh, my god!

320
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:51,015
等等  你抽的是不是我的
Wait a minute. Is that my weed?

321
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:53,091
怎么回事啊  朋友
What the hell, man?

322
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:57,003
还真把这当你家了  是不是啊
Make yourself at home, why don't you?

323
00:32:00,063 --> 00:32:02,069
你到底买什么了
So what did you end up buying?

324
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,063
啥都没买
Nothing.

325
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:07,084
镇上没那种
No store in town sells a plastic bin

326
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,065
大到能装下一个人的塑料箱卖
big enough for a body.

327
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,039
我还真没指望你会去买俩
I don't suppose you could buy two bins...

328
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:21,092
一个装下半身  一个装上半身
Legs in one, torso in the other?

329
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,078
老天爷
God.

330
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,073
我也从没想过你会阿谀奉承我
I don't suppose you could kiss my ass?

331
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:41,029
你进展如何
So, how did it go?

332
00:32:49,023 --> 00:32:51,001
你还没搞定吗
So you didn't do it?

333
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:52,087
还没呢
Not yet.

334
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,034
天啊
God.

335
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,008
该死
Damn.

336
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:02,063
-我得走了  -啥  别走  给我回来
- I gotta go.  - What? No, come back here!

337
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:06,007
抱歉  我保证明天搞定
Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.

338
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,022
明天吗
Tomorrow?

339
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:09,035
我跟医生约好了  我得走了
I've got a doctor's appointement, I gotta go.

340
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:10,066
听着  离他远点
Look, stay away from him.

341
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:13,009
他醒了
He's awake.

342
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:18,013
哥们  我们可是抛了硬币的
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

343
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,020
我们抛了硬币的
We flipped a coin!

344
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:29,036

We're good?

345
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,026
非常好
We're very good.

346
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:34,045
我得说  非常之好
We're excellent, I'd say.

347
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,028
你来瞧瞧那张脸
Oh, would you look at that face!

348
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,091
笑一个  小家伙

Can I tell you this is exactly what I was hoping?

354

还记得你说过
You remember you said that

355

Excuse me!

417
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:43,022
有人在吗
Excuse me?

418
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:44,000
你
You.

419
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:45,083
就是你
Yes, you.

420
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:47,031
能跟你谈谈吗
May I talk to you?

421
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:53,012
这是私人地盘
This is private property!

422
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:54,086
就几句话  我说了就走
Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.

423
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,086
我没兴趣
No, I'm not interested.

424
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:59,074
别碰我  不要碰我
Hey, don't touch me! Do not touch me.

425
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:02,043
好的  不碰你  放心了吧  不会碰你
All right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching here.

426
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,079
女士  不管你推销什么  我是不会买的
Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo.

427
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,052
我是斯凯勒·怀特
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.

428
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,071
我丈夫叫沃尔特·怀特
My husband is Walter White, yo.

429
00:40:13,015 --> 00:40:14,090
他全都告诉我了
He told me everything.

430
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:17,081
-真的吗  -是的
- Seriously?  - That's right.

431
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:20,012
你要知道...
And just so you know...

432
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:24,099
我妹夫是缉毒局探员
My brother-in-law is a DEA agent.

433
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:27,014
逼不得已的时候
And I will not hesitate to call him.

434
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:28,087
我会毫不犹豫地告发你
Not if I have to.

435
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:31,005
明白吗
Understood?

436
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,025
别说我没警告过你
This is your one and only warning.

437
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:39,029
不许再卖大麻给我丈夫
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.

438
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,042
-好的  -我说到做到
- Okay.  - I mean it.

439
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:45,026
别再往我家打电话
Don't call our house again.

440
00:40:45,052 --> 00:40:49,063
别再缠着他  不然有你好果子吃
You stay away from him, or you'll be one sorry individual.

441
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:52,095
听明白了
You got me?

442
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:54,081
我想是的
I think so, yeah.

443
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,014
大麻  不许再卖给他
No more marijuana.

444
00:40:58,014 --> 00:40:59,050
我明白
I can dig it.

445
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,038
你明白了
You can dig it.

446
00:41:02,057 --> 00:41:03,035
很好
Wonderful.

447
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:15,077
虽然不关我什么事
Not that it's any of my business,

448
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:19,024
但你也许该考虑换种活法了
but you might wanna consider a different line of work.

449
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,076
好的
Okay.

450
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:19,097
一起去你家
"Let's go to your house, yo!

451
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:21,072
简直太棒了
"Makes perfect sense. Let's...

452
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:27,006
把你们家统统搞乱
"Let's completely screw up your house

453
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:28,089
让你一天都待不下去
"So you never wanna spend another night in it."

454
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:31,036
当然  干嘛不呢
"Sure. You know, why not?"

455
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:37,096
然后让我找个神经病婊子
"And then, how's about I send

456
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,083
去找你怎么样
over my psycho-bitch off my mind.

457
00:42:41,002 --> 00:42:42,099
让她废了你再吓颇你的胆
"You know, break your balls and threaten you?

458
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,089
老天  那太滑稽了
"God, that'd be hilarious."

459
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:47,039
还有那个在地下室里的杀手
"And then, the killer in the basement?

460
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:50,074
也由我全权负责
"The one who's completely my responsabilty.

461
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:54,022
就让他在那住下吧
"Hell, let's just let him live down there.

462
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,004
我只要管饭就行
"Just, I don't know, make sure to feed him, like...

463
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:00,026
一日三餐不耽误
"Three times a day."

464
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:02,093
当然  干嘛不呢
"Sure, why not?

465
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:04,058
那简直太棒了
"That would be really amazing.

466
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,059
谢谢你给我这个机会
"Thank you so much for the opportunity.

467
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:10,003
我一直梦想着有一天  化个尸什么的
"I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies."

468
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:36,084
你有个弟弟在天杀的缉毒局对吧
You got a brother in the goddamned DEA?

469
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:43,077
你说过你只是路上碰到的
You said you were just doing some ride-along.

470
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,071
你有个弟弟在缉毒局  是不是
Yes or no, do you have a brother in the DEA?

471
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,033
是我连襟
Brother-in-law.

472
00:43:49,037 --> 00:43:52,000
现在我总算松了一口气了
Now there's a load off my mind.

473
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:53,074
你从哪听来的
Where did you hear that?

474
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:55,081
你家那疯婆子来数落我的时候
Your freaking wife told me when

475
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:57,093
亲口说的
she was here all of my shit?

476
00:43:58,006 --> 00:43:59,001
对  就是这样
Yeah, that's right.

477
00:43:59,002 --> 00:44:01,042
我在搬尸的时候差点给她逮到
She almost caught me moving Emilio!

478
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:05,025
在家里人模狗样的装得不错嘛
Good job in wearing the pants in the family.

479
00:44:05,038 --> 00:44:08,078
为什么跟她说我卖大麻给你了
And why did you go and tell her I was selling you weed?

480
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:13,010
不管怎么说  总比承认我在
Because somehow, it seemed preferable to admitting

481
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,007
制冰毒而且还杀了人强吧
that I cook crystal meth and killed a man.

482
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,095
是我想的那个吗
Is that what I think it is?

483
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:29,023
对  我吸了  有意见啊
Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl, so what?

484
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,051
我的地盘我做主
My house, my rules.

485
00:44:31,012 --> 00:44:34,078
不不  别这么看着我  我都搞定了
Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay? I held up my end.

486
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:36,054
把埃米利奥处理掉了
I already took care of Emilio.

487
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:39,033
就在你闲荡  搞基的时候
You're still diddling around, trying to get your nut up.

488
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:43,035
胡说  我还有份糟透了的工作要做
Well, boo-hoo. I have the truly awful job here.

489
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:45,045
你懂什么叫糟透了吗你  你懂吗
You wanna talk awful? You wanna go there?

490
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:49,041
拖个两百磅重臭气熏天的尸体上楼试试
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs.

491
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:51,087
把他弄进浴缸我容易吗
I barely got him in the bathtub!

492
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:53,085
浴缸  什么
Bathtub? What...

493
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,090
-你说"浴缸"是什么意思  -还有件事
- What do you mean, "Bathtub"?  - That's another thing,

494
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,055
你干嘛让我找遍全城
Why you got me running around town,

495
00:44:58,056 --> 00:45:00,090
找什么愚蠢的塑料桶
trying to find some stupid piece of plastic,

496
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:03,020
我那浴缸用起来就十分足够了
when I have a perfectly good tub I can use?

497
00:45:07,014 --> 00:45:08,060
我的天
Oh, God.

498
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:08,071
抱歉  你刚问我什么来着
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?

499
00:46:08,077 --> 00:46:10,005
想起来了
Oh, yes.

500
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:13,080
我让你去找什么"愚蠢的"塑料容器
That stupid plastic container I asked you to buy.

501
00:46:14,055 --> 00:46:18,013
看到了吧  氢氟酸不会腐蚀塑料
You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic.

502
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:21,095
但却能溶解金属  岩石
It will however dissolve metal, rock,

503
00:46:21,095 --> 00:46:24,034
玻璃  还有陶瓷
glass, ceramic.

504
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,042
就像现在这样
So there's that.
