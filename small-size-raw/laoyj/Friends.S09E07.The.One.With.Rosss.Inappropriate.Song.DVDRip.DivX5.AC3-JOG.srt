我相信他们会的，但是你不用这样假

135
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,300
I want them to get to know Phoebe, not "Phoebe."
我要他们认识菲比，不是“妃妣”

136
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,940
It is fun, though, isn't it?

- You've got it. - All right.

嗯，好的，我本来是上州人…

144
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,000
but then my mom killed herself, and my stepdad went to prison.
但是后来我妈自杀，然后继父去坐牢

145
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,730
So I moved to the city, where I lived in a burned-out Buick LeSabre for a while.
所以我就搬到市中心 住在一辆火烧车里一阵子

146
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,070
Which was okay. That was okay.

But I got over it.

So where does everyone summer?

Did you take that tape?
你拿走那卷带子吗？

我必须要！假设你结婚了 然后你发现一卷你老婆带子…

159
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,800

在另一个男人的公寓里 你难道不想知道里面是什么吗？

165
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,010
I mean, it's probably not even what I think it is.
我是说，或许根本不是我想的那样

166
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,380
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head.

几秒钟就好，让我知道那是什么，拜托

好啦，可以，但是万一我很乐在其中 你就只能怪你自己！

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,990
what do you think?
你们觉得如何呢？

250
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,390
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
所以你从李察的公寓偷了这卷带子？

251
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,400
Listen to the judgment from the porn star!
听听这三级片脱星在批评我！

252
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,170
That tape was never meant to be seen by..
那带子本来就不是要让…

253
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,250
Joey, I would feel more comfortable if this conversation were in private.
乔伊，我希望可以私下谈论这件事

254
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,510
Monica, look, I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore.
摩妮卡，听着，我不认为 你我之间有存在任何秘密了

还没有准备好可以开玩笑吗？待会见

256
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,360
Why in the world would you take this tape? And why would you watch it?
你为什么要拿这卷带子呢？ 而且为什么要看呢？

257

Because that's who I am. Okay?
因为我就是这样的人，好吗？

I'm sure a man like Richard could see a tape like that and not be bothered.
我相信像李察那样的男人可以 看这样的带子而且不会被说教

259
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,830
It'd just be another saucy anecdote..
这只不过是个黄色的小插曲…

260
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,170
for him to share at his men's club over brandy and mustaches.
让他可以在他的男性俱乐部里 边喝着白兰地摸着胡子和兄弟们分享

这一切跟你没有办法长胡子有关吗？

262
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,210
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you.
这跟你还有李察有关 很明显地他还没有忘记你

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,220
He keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants.
他保留这带子让他可以 在任何想的时候就看

264
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,120
Isn't that sad? Can't you see how pathetic that is?
那不是很悲惨吗？ 你看不出来这是多可悲的事吗？

265
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,790
Don't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
别吃醋了，你应该为他感到可怜

266
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,760
Yeah, well, poor Richard, he..

I can grow a mustache.
我可以长胡子的

268

这不是我们的问题，我们拥有彼此 这是最重要的

269
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,600
But I just keep picturing you rolling around with him, with your..

cowboy boots in the air.
牛仔靴子在空中晃来晃去

牛仔靴子？我这辈子 从没有穿过牛仔靴子

272

Good, good. Play more because I wanna see how it ends.
很好，非常好，再多放一点 因为我想看结局是怎样

273
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,220

Ride 'em, cowgirl!

276
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,220
That bastard taped over me!

277
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,300
Is that a problem?
那有什么问题吗？

278
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,730
It's just so insulting. Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!
真是太侮辱人了 花钱买新的空白带子嘛，医师！

279
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,880
Yes, but the important thing is that we have each other, right?
是的，但是重要的是我们拥有彼此 不是吗？

280
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,980
Well, yeah. It's just so rude!
嗯，是的，不过这非常没礼貌！

281

-我们做的方式要比那个好太多… -你要把这个句子说完吗？

282
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,590
I can't imagine what he sees in her.
我无法想像他在她身上 看到什么吸引人的

283
