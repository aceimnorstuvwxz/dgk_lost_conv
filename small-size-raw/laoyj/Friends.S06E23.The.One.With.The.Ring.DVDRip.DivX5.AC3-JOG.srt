昨天钱德和菲比 不是看到我们就跑？

146
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,030
No.
有吗？

147
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,790
-Remember,you were eating pizza? -Yeah.
你当时在吃披萨 喔对

149
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,200
Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game.
钱德显然是在气我们2星期前 没帮他买球票

150
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,710
We were supposed to just get him one? That guy's always mooching off of us.
我们为什么要帮他买票？ 那砘锢鲜强我们的油 就是啊

152
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,320
Anyway,I still think we should try to patch things up.
但我还是觉得应该设法和解

153
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,720
We could get tickets to another game and invite him.
我们可以找他去看另一场球赛

154
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,020
That's a great idea. And I still have his credit card.
好主意 而且他的卡还在我这里

155
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,590
Here you go.
帐单

156
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,890
Hey,hey. I got this one. Here you go.
我有卡，拿去吧

157
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,570
Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.
有时候我真搞不懂钱德

158
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,370
We do stuff all the time without you, and you don't get all upset.
我和他做很多事都没找你 你也不会生气

159
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,380
-All the time? -All the time.
很多事？ 可多了

160
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,010
I'm sorry,it was rejected.
抱歉，这张卡不能刷

161
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,850
That's impossible. Let me see that.
不可能，我看看

162
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,810
This one's mine. Here you go.
这张是我的，拿去吧

163
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,230
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
我的天哪  我的天哪

164
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,320
-Still crying? -Like a little girl.
还在哭？ 跟小女生一样

165
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,690
I know,I know. This is all my fault.
我知道…都是我不好

166
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,700
I wanted him to open up.
是我要他敞开心胸的

167
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,500
I didn't know that I was gonna unleash...
但是我不知道我会放出一头...

168
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,740
this weepy,clingy, moist monster!
哭哭啼啼又黏人的怪物

169
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,680
I only know of two ways to shut a man up. One of them is sex.
有两个办法能让一个男人闭嘴 其中一个是性爱

171
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,240
-What's the other? -Don't know. Never had to use it.
-另一个是什么？ -不知道，我只用过第一个

172
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,020
I'm just saying, if we're having sex, he's not talking.
我只是说做爱的时候 他就不能讲话

173
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,450
That's right. You're the talker.
没错，话多的是你

174
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,920
Anyway, great idea.
总之这个主意很棒

175
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,390
I gotta buy him some more tissues.
我要去商店 我答应去帮他买面纸

176
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,870
-We have some here. -No,you don't!
-我们这里有… -你们没有

177
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,180
Okay. I'd also like to try on the tiara.
好，我还想试戴头饰

178
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,740
Oh,yeah. Okay.
太好了

179
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,090
What do you think? Too much?
怎么样？太花了？

180
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,410
A tad.
有一点 

181
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,190
Take the tiara back...
把头饰放回去

and let me hold the musket again.

Something's missing.

184
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,780
Let me see the ring that my friend picked out.
把我朋友挑的戒指拿给我

-那枚20年代的钻戒呢？ -刚刚卖给那位先生

188
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,450
Wait,no!

Chandler...

It's just that my dad never did.

I miss my dad.

I didn't mean to overwhelm you.
我不是故意的 

284
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,390
It's just that when those gates open...
只不过情绪一发泄

285
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,530
it's hard to close them.
就会…不可收拾

I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.

I'd like that.
我求之不得

291
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,190
That was so good!
真是…太棒了

292
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,040

293
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,520
I can't believe you talked me into this gumball-machine-looking ring.
我居然听你的话 买下这枚造型廉价的戒指

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,520
It's not a gumball-machine-looking ring. It's a beautiful ring!
它才没有造型廉价，它很漂亮

295
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,210
No, it's not.

When I looked at the other ring, I could see Monica's face...
另一枚戒指 会让我看到摩妮卡的表情

297
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,100
and I could see her saying yes. Looking at this,I only see a ring.
我会看到她点头答应 这枚戒指只让我看到一枚戒指

299
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,700
Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye.
只有近看才会看到我自己的眼睛

300

301
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,250
Maybe we could get the other ring back.

I heard where the guy was gonna propose.

-或许我们可以说服他交换  -我不能这么做

304
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,920
You certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
你总不能给她那枚廉价的戒指

No,just L'Espace.
