140
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,400
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
因为她讨厌陶瓷货仓 

141
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,940
She hates Pottery Barn?
她讨厌陶瓷货仓？

142
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,800
I know. I know. She says it's all mass-produced...
我也很惊讶，她说那是量产 

143
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,950
nothing is authentic,and everyone winds up having the same stuff.

她随时会进来 拿个东西盖住它好吗？

I forgot they made sheets!

I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn.

149
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not like she hates you.

150
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,270
Yeah,but Pottery Barn?
但是陶瓷货仓耶

151
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,620
You know what I think? She's just weird.
我觉得根本是她怪胎

152
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,250
It's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
因为她是双胞胎 双胞胎都很怪

她不是怪 她只是希望她的东西独一无二

Oh,no,she really is sick.

Why doesn't she want to hang out with us?

She was lying to our faces?

I can't believe this. Who is she to judge us?
太扯了，她凭什么批评我们？

但你不觉得生病比看戏好吗？

198
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,680
They're both good. I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again."
