Any luck?

You know how Ross and I have always been on-again,off-again?
罗斯和我不是一直分分合合？

286
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,250
I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road...
我想我一直觉得在将来 我们会...

287
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,420
...we would be on again.
再合…

288
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,850

You know what? I think we all did.

Well,you'd better make it for three.

It's okay.
