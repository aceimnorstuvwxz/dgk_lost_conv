事出突然，抱歉房里一团乱

151
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,920
Oh,who cares?

152
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,770
Oh,my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
天哪 我住的时候绝对不是长这样 

154
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,370
I know!
我知道

155
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,610
But there's only room for one, so one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
问题是这里只能睡一个人 另一个人得去住乔伊家

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Since the fire was kind of my fault, you should get to stay here.
既然失火是我引起的 你就睡这里吧

157
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,110
Hey,hey, now. This was no one's fault. It was an accident.
谁也没有错，那是个意外

158
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,830
It was my fault. You should get the nice room.
不，是我害的，你应该睡这里 

159
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,650

Just tell me how you like your eggs.

This right here is where I keep the pizza.

-What's that smell? -I know! I don't...

168
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,920
Oh, please, it was such a big class. You never even noticed me.
拜托，那么大一个班 你根本没有注意到我

171
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,840
Oh. I had trouble remembering names, so I came up with nicknames.
我记不住全班的名字 就取绰号代替

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,100
The guy on the other side of you was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt."

Listen, I gotta tell you, I'm having a great time.

179
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,530
You said it might be weird, the whole student/teacher thing?
你之前说师生约会很奇怪

180
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,530
And to be frank, I thought it would be too.
其实我也有同感 

181

But it's not. I mean,it's not at all.

I think it is!

I can hardly smell it over here.
这里又闻不到

202

Well, you let me know if you can. I can bake a pie to cover it.
闻得到就说 我可以烤个派把它盖过去

Really?

No,no. It was the candles.

Yeah. It's very not good leaving candles unattended.

罗斯，小心一点 别被叫成麦泡学生教授

241
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,900
The yarns that you weave!

You know, actually, I should get going.

Oh,no,no,stay! Because you should stay.

248
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,580
and I don't want to hurt you.

Oh,I'm sorry.

-或许你可以做一件事 -什么事？你尽管说

255
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,950
Well, I mean, this is just off the top of my head now.
我是刚刚才想到的

256
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,910
But I have this friend.. This actor friend.
