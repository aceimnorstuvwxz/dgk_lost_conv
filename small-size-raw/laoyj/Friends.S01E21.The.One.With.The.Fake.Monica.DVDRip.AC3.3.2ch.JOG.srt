134
00:10:44,91 --> 00:10:48,77
You know,like San Diego. Right?
比方说圣地牙哥动物园

135
00:10:49,64 --> 00:10:53,71
But that may just be a pipe dream. He's out-of-state.
那可能只是遥不可及的梦想,因为它在加州

136
00:10:55,95 --> 00:11:00,28
My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
兽医说她认识迈阿密的朋友,或许有可能

137
00:11:00,52 --> 00:11:05,25
But that's two blocks from the beach. It's a total party zoo.
那儿似乎离海滩只有两条街, 一定是个疯狂动物园

138
00:11:10,63 --> 00:11:12,26
We found the girl.

Oh,your own brand of vigilante justice.

Are you insane? This woman stole from you.

She stole. She's a stealer.

和这女人相处十分钟后, 你就会把这些全忘了

144

I mean,she's this astounding person with this amazing spirit.
她简直是奇女子,振奋人心

145
00:11:36,32 --> 00:11:39,49
Which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
她可能是从某位啦啦队队员那儿偷来的

146
00:11:41,90 --> 00:11:45,26
-Take off their hats. -Popes in a Vokswagen.

-不可能,你不可能这么做 -摩娜娜相当勇敢

149

We told them we were the Gundersons in room 61 5...
我说我们是615房的冈氏姐妹

150
00:12:02,95 --> 00:12:07,08
...only to find out the Boston Celtics had the entire floor.
结果波士顿塞尔提克已包下整个六楼

151
00:12:07,29 --> 00:12:10,72
When they saw that we're short and have breasts....
他们知道我们又矮又有胸部时

152
00:12:11,43 --> 00:12:15,62
They threw us out. I was thrown out of a hotel. Me.

Go,Monana.

154
00:12:19,27 --> 00:12:22,86
You ladies are not the only ones living the dream.
不是只有你们活在梦中

155
00:12:23,14 --> 00:12:27,87
I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
我得去为我不认识的人倒咖啡,不用等我了

156
00:12:30,11 --> 00:12:31,31

...tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
明天我们要去参加百老汇的试演

158

-Excuse me? -There's an open call for Cats.
-什么? -“猫”剧还有一个缺额

159
00:12:39,39 --> 00:12:42,12
I'm thinking we sing "Memories"...
我想我们可以去唱“回忆”

160
00:12:42,36 --> 00:12:46,66
...and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say?
让自己当个傻子,如何?

161
00:12:46,86 --> 00:12:51,16
No,no,no. Remember who you're dealing with here.
不,记得你身旁的人是谁

162
00:12:51,37 --> 00:12:54,60
I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
我和你不一样 我连站在踢踏舞教室前都有困难

163
00:12:54,80 --> 00:12:57,97
That's because of your Amish background.
因为你有阿米许的血统

164
00:12:59,27 --> 00:13:02,00
-What? -You're Pennsylvania Dutch,right?
-什么? -你不是宾州荷兰人吗?

165
00:13:02,21 --> 00:13:06,67
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer. Then I was shunned.
对,直到我买了吹风机被逐出村里

166
00:13:08,68 --> 00:13:14,25
I was just like you. And then,one day, I saw a movie that changed my life.
我过去也和你一样 有一天我看了出改变我人生的电影

167

Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?

I thought that movie was so incredibly boring.

That thing at the end where the kid...

171
00:13:30,17 --> 00:13:36,17
It's like,"Kid,wait a year. Leave home,do some community theater."
这是在干什么? 他再等一年离家,到社区话剧团去

172
00:13:37,18 --> 00:13:43,41
I thought,"That's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back."
走出电影院时我想, 我这逝去两小时的生命,永远不再回

173
00:13:43,62 --> 00:13:48,11
That scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
这想法震惊了我,从此我便及时行乐

174
00:13:48,32 --> 00:13:52,62
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
那么我不敢推荐“窈窕奶爸”了

175

We didn't get into Scranton.
我们进不了斯克兰顿了

That was,like,our safety zoo.

They take,like,dogs and cows.

See,I don't know who this is harder on,me or him.
我不懂是我还是它比较难受

180

181
00:14:26,99 --> 00:14:30,12
Marcel. Marcel. Marcel,no.

You're kidding.

186
00:14:51,15 --> 00:14:56,85
Apparently,he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered people.
显然他是屠杀各种民族的俄国独裁者

187
00:14:57,22 --> 00:15:01,72

Where exactly is your zoo?

Well,it's technically not a zoo,per se.

194

It's more of an interactive wildlife experience.

195
00:15:37,70 --> 00:15:40,79
Let me ask you some questions about Marcel.
