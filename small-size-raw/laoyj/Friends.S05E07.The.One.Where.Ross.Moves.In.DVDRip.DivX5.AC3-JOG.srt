I know. But look at the knobs on it!
我知道，你看它的咪咪多大

5
00:00:17,41 --> 00:00:18,90

Emily's cousin kicked me out.
艾蜜莉的表妹 竟然把我赶出来

-What? -Why?
什么？ 为什么？

8
00:00:22,58 --> 00:00:25,28
When you sublet from your wife's cousin...

11
00:00:29,82 --> 00:00:31,35
Didn't you sign a lease?
怎么可以？你们没签约吗？

12
00:00:31,59 --> 00:00:33,99
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
谁跟亲戚租公寓还签约？

13
00:00:36,36 --> 00:00:38,36
You can stay with us.

00:00:40,34 --> 00:00:43,17
But you have to let us know when you feel better...
你心情好一点就说一声

17
00:00:43,44 --> 00:00:45,20
...so we can make fun of your hair.
好让我们取笑你的鸡窝头

谢谢你们，我太感激了

我最近不断搬家 简直像是游民

23
00:01:00,82 --> 00:01:04,05

If every place were this clean, it'd be tough making a living.
要是每家餐厅都跟你的一样干净
我就没饭吃了

28
00:01:58,45 --> 00:01:59,78
Oh,Larry!
别说了，赖瑞

29
00:02:00,42 --> 00:02:02,94
Do health inspectors work on commission?
卫生稽查员收佣金吗？

30
00:02:03,18 --> 00:02:04,55
No,bribes.

我去检查厨房地板 请自便，赖瑞

35

我绝对不会违规
地板干净到 豆子都能捡起来吃

00:02:33,55 --> 00:02:36,21
I deducted two points for not wearing your hat.
你没戴帽子所以扣两分 

43
00:02:36,42 --> 00:02:38,58
That is a Section 5 violation.

44
00:02:38,79 --> 00:02:40,95
Now look,Larry,honey.

You only need to wear it in the kitchen.

There's the two points!
扣两分

50
00:02:54,07 --> 00:02:56,80
You should really read that book you wrote.
专家也不过如此嘛

51
00:03:04,25 --> 00:03:09,15
You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew she'd go in hatless to get it.
你看到帽子在厨房
知道她进去时没戴帽子

53
00:03:09,35 --> 00:03:12,75
You could have your own health inspector detective show.
你可以当卫生稽查员 兼侦探了

54
00:03:14,09 --> 00:03:15,32
I don't know about that.

00:03:15,52 --> 00:03:18,08
But then I could be your sidekick,Voonda.

56
00:03:19,09 --> 00:03:22,29
Maybe I could ask Voonda to dinner sometime?

He's not great.

65
00:03:52,99 --> 00:03:56,02
But he's dealing with it. Wait,you're not
不过还死不了 等等，你该不会…
拜托，不可能

I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again.
我不可能再跟罗斯交往

68
00:03:59,87 --> 00:04:02,34
He'll be screwed up for a long time.
他还要失魂落魄大半年哩

69
00:04:02,57 --> 00:04:06,30
Besides,I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
况且你也知道 我不喜欢刚离婚的男人

70
00:04:06,57 --> 00:04:10,87
Right,you only go for them five minutes before they get married.
对，快结婚的人你才要

71
00:04:15,05 --> 00:04:16,88
-Two pounds of mocha java. -It's Danny.
我要两磅爪哇摩卡咖啡 是丹尼

73
00:04:18,35 --> 00:04:19,51
Are you going to go out again?

不知道 上次出去一次之后 他就没再打给我

75
00:04:22,76 --> 00:04:25,85
I see him in the hallway. We flirt. I'm all:
我们只在走廊上打情骂俏 
我笑得花枝乱颤

77
00:04:27,00 --> 00:04:28,59
And then nothing.
却没下文

78
00:04:29,23 --> 00:04:29,99
嘿

79
00:04:31,33 --> 00:04:32,56
Wow,thirsty.
你很渴吧？

80
00:04:32,77 --> 00:04:36,23
I'm having a party on Saturday. Sort of a housewarming thing.

83
00:04:38,21 --> 00:04:39,67
I'm looking forward to it.

84
00:04:39,94 --> 00:04:41,07
See you!

86
00:04:46,18 --> 00:04:48,77
So I guess we won't be warming his house.
看来他新家不欢迎我们

87
00:04:51,59 --> 00:04:54,08
All right,I see what he's doing.
很好，我知道他在玩什么把戏

88
00:04:54,36 --> 00:04:58,35
He's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out.
他故意不约我 因为他要我主动约他

89
00:04:58,76 --> 00:04:59,75
And you won't do that.
可是你不鸟他

90
00:04:59,96 --> 00:05:01,36
That's right!
没错

91
00:05:01,60 --> 00:05:04,69
Because that would give him the control.
否则主导权就落在他手里

92
00:05:04,93 --> 00:05:08,06
So now he comes up with this "I've got a party" thing...
他现在故意说什么要办派对 

93
00:05:08,27 --> 00:05:10,90
...to get me to hint for an invitation.
要我暗示他约我

94
00:05:11,14 --> 00:05:13,04
Blew up in his face,didn't it?
可是我当场给他好看

95
00:05:14,48 --> 00:05:16,31
So there is no party?
所以他根本没有要办派对

96
00:05:17,28 --> 00:05:20,21
No,there's a party. There's a party.
有，当然有

97
00:05:20,45 --> 00:05:21,92
But the power?
不过谁是老大

98
00:05:22,12 --> 00:05:24,28
That is still up for grabs.
还不知道哩

99
00:05:24,72 --> 00:05:26,48
You follow me?
你听得懂吗？

100
00:05:26,75 --> 00:05:28,02
I think so.
应该吧

101
00:05:28,22 --> 00:05:32,09
So he won't invite you to his party because he likes you?
你说他喜欢你 所以故意不约你

102
00:05:32,56 --> 00:05:33,55
Exactly!
就是这样

103
00:05:36,40 --> 00:05:39,46
Then why didn't he invite me?
可是他为什么不约我？

104
00:05:42,77 --> 00:05:44,57
To throw me off.
故意吊我胃口

105
00:05:53,81 --> 00:05:54,21

I love what you've done with the place.

I know it's a lot of boxes.
我知道箱子堆得到处都是

...which puts me back in the driver's seat.

169
00:09:32,00 --> 00:09:34,33
So the ball is in his court?

Ball?

No,there's no ball.

00:09:39,24 --> 00:09:41,21
Hey,Phoebe,you want to join us?
菲比，你吃不吃？

Bye-bye,little puppet Joey hand?

I don't know how much more I can take.

他竟然拿我的海滩游侠录影带 去录什么怪小虫

192
00:11:07,56 --> 00:11:08,96

What if that had been porn?

我刚去强诺买鸡块 那里竟然停业了

I took Larry there,but it was all violated,so we shut it down.
我带赖瑞去，餐厅不合规定 我们勒令他们停业

It's Danny.

你们知道赖瑞会怎么回答吗？ 他会说，“杓后见”

But then I have to go all the way around.
