...and you guys saw the doorknob.

Two days? You must be bummed.
两天？你一定很失望

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,540
She's got to go back to London,but I've been prepared for this from the start.
她非回去不可 不过我早就有心理准备 
 
62
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,480
We both knew we had two weeks together, and then that's it.
我们都知道我们只有这2星期

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,380
Hey,that's what all my relationships are like.
我的每段恋情都是

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,390
Yes,but in Ross' case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
罗斯他们是“双方”都知道 只有2星期

65

66
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,220
No,I know. Yeah.
宝宝好啊 好啦

67
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,570
So the baby is totally craving meat.
宝宝想肉想疯了

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,400
I tried tricking it,and I made it a soy burger, so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.
下午我想用素肉堡骗他 让他以为他吃到肉

69
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,510
And I got nauseous.
结果就反胃了

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,970
Maybe that's because soy burgers suck.
也许是因为素肉堡粉难吃

71
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,650
But I'm no obstetrician....
不过应该很营养

72

Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.
怀孕真难吃东西

73

At least you got that cool,pregnant-lady glow.
但你有一种孕妇的光彩

74
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,290
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
你要是吐一早上也会有光彩

75
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,720

-Here's that trench coat that you wanted. -Great.
这是你要的风衣 太好了

77
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,670
It's comfortable.
很舒服

78
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,810
You could really flash somebody in this.
这可以用来装变态

79
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,350
No. They don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
不行，出了店门 才能把手放进口袋里

80
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,610
Why not?
为什么？

81
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,420

...we get a lot of
有很多人…

83
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,020
They ruin it for everybody.
真是害群之马 

84
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,490
I know.
是啊

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,230
I wore that sweater on a date last night.
我昨晚穿那件 喀什米尔毛衣去约会

86
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,360
It was the first date since the divorce.

She's nice, but it made me realize...

90
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,750
That's interesting.
真有意思

91
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,020
-What was that? -Just an anti-theft device.
那是什么？ 只是防盗磁条

92
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,360
Then what's this?
那这是什么？

93
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,690
You need that too,because a thief could just tear this up.
那个也要，因为这个一撕就碎

94
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,910
We have to have a party in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
晚上有派对 其实是5分钟后，有事快取消

95
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,310
What's going on?
你在说什么？ 怎么回事？

96

We have to have a bon-voyage party for Emily.

But it's actually for Joshua.

That sucks. Nobody's ever thrown me a bon-voyage-Emily party.
讨厌 都没人帮我办过假欢送会

99
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,320
He said he's not ready to date.
他说他还没有心情约会

100
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,790
So I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work.
我得找他参加派对 才能在工作之外见到他

101
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,660
And now I have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.
现在我制造了一个 色诱他的完美机会

As much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him...
我很想当面警告约书亚

但艾蜜莉和我不能参加 她会来说声再见

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,010

然后我安排了整晚的节目 对不起，没戏唱了

105

107
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,090
No one's thrown me a surprise party before.
没有人替我办过惊喜派对

108
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,090
Well,it was all Ross' idea.

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,940
You didn't know?
你真的没料到？

112
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,150
Why are you over here if Joshua's over there?
约书亚在那边，你怎么在这边

113
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,980
I'm trying to play hard-to-get.
我想假装很难上手

114
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,160
Quick! He's looking. Say something funny.
快，说句好笑的话

115
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,490
Like what?

What's so funny?
什么事这么好笑？

117
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,630
I said,"Like what?"
我说“举个例”

118
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,130
Now that's a thinker.
真深奥

119
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,310
This playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.
假装很难上手没用

120
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
Hand me those cherries.
把樱桃给我，好…

121
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,290
-Care for a cherry? -No,thanks.
要吃樱桃吗？ 不要，谢谢

122
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,620
I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.

123
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,240
You okay?
你还好吗？

124
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,710
You all right?

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,510
We should probably get going soon.

But the party's just getting started.

129
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,420
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
那你为什么还办派对？

130
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,830
不是的

131
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,300
Actually,American surprise parties are very short.
其实美国的惊喜派对都很短

It's usually,"Surprise!" Then,"My God,I'm so surprised. Bye!"
通常都“惊喜！” 然后就“我好惊喜喔！再见”

133
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,340
Ross,I'm having such a great time.
但是我觉得好好玩

134
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,540
Your sister told me that you used to dress up like old ladies...

136

Monica said that,did she?

Did she tell you that when she was little...

139
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,430
...regulating the strength of swing sets?
她也是原因之一？

140
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,540

167
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,450
Spin-the-bottle works like this: I spin the bottle.
