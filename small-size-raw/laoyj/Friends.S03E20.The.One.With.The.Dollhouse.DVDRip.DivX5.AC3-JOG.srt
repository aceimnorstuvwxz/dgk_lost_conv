他的心肠很好吧？

143
00:09:51,52 --> 00:09:55,35
And he's so sweet. He said he'd call,so put him straight through.
而且他好甜 他说他会打来，要立刻转给我

144
00:09:55,66 --> 00:09:58,65
-lsn't this great? -Don't spoil it.
太好了 不要扫兴

145
00:10:00,56 --> 00:10:03,16
Come on,baby,don't go. Please?
求求你，不要走

146
00:10:03,40 --> 00:10:04,73
What do you say?
好吗？

147
00:10:08,00 --> 00:10:10,49
It's you. Just one sec.
是你，等一下

148
00:10:12,17 --> 00:10:14,00
I'm going to take this call.
我要接个电话

149
00:10:15,24 --> 00:10:18,41
When I continue, I hope there will appear on-stage...

150
00:10:18,68 --> 00:10:23,17
...this magical thing that in the theater we call...

151
00:10:23,42 --> 00:10:26,39
...committing to the moment!
入戏！

152
00:10:30,59 --> 00:10:32,92
The guy's like a cartoon.
他好可笑

153
00:10:33,76 --> 00:10:35,63
What do you see in him,anyway?
你到底看上他哪一点？

154
00:10:35,86 --> 00:10:37,30
He happens to be brilliant.
他很聪明

155
00:10:37,53 --> 00:10:40,59
Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
比你那位毛衣女O好多了

156
00:10:42,37 --> 00:10:44,57
I'm not interested in her sweater.
我不是看上她的毛衣

157
00:10:44,81 --> 00:10:46,97
It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.
毛衣底下才重要

158
00:10:50,21 --> 00:10:52,11
And besides...
而且…

159
00:10:52,41 --> 00:10:54,11
...since when do you care who I'm with?
你几时开始关心我跟谁交往？

I don't care. Why,do you want me to care?

What?

Okay. I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick up where we left off.
我实在很不想说 不过我们继续排吧

I've got no reason to stay.

167
00:11:25,25 --> 00:11:26,80
Stop!
停！

168
00:11:27,11 --> 00:11:30,64
Stop it! You must stop!
停！别再演了

169
00:11:32,49 --> 00:11:35,15
You are bad actors!
你们是烂演员

170
00:11:35,49 --> 00:11:37,96
This is a terrible play!
这是出烂戏

171
00:11:38,19 --> 00:11:40,49
I'll see you in the morning.
明天早上见

172
00:11:43,10 --> 00:11:46,29
I can't believe we go on in a week.
居然一星期后就要上演了

173
00:11:46,67 --> 00:11:49,03
Hey,it's gonna be all right.
没问题的

174
00:11:49,94 --> 00:11:52,77
Since we're getting off early, do you want to go paint mugs?
既然提早收工 你想去画马克杯吗？

175
00:11:55,81 --> 00:11:56,94

什么？

176
00:11:57,48 --> 00:11:59,95
At the place I told you about last night?

Yeah,with the mug-painting.
对了，那里可以画马克杯

178
00:12:04,49 --> 00:12:06,78
I was so listening to that.
我听得很用心

179
00:12:07,89 --> 00:12:10,86
But you know what? I need to work on my stuff tonight.

What are we gonna do about the scene?
这场戏怎么办？

184
00:12:34,72 --> 00:12:35,91
I don't know.
不知道

185
00:12:40,15 --> 00:12:42,38
Maybe if it had more heat.
也许应该再激烈一点

186
00:12:43,22 --> 00:12:44,69
Well,how do you mean?
怎么说？

187
00:12:44,93 --> 00:12:47,76
Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay,right?
爱莉安在寻找留下来的理由

188

189
00:12:52,27 --> 00:12:54,60
... he's gotta give her a reason.
必须给她有力的理由

190
00:12:55,57 --> 00:12:57,59
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

191
00:13:03,61 --> 00:13:05,24
Or maybe...
或者…

192
00:13:05,51 --> 00:13:09,42
... maybe he could grab her and lift her up.
他可以捉住她，把她抱起来

193
00:13:09,95 --> 00:13:13,25
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs around his waist.
然后爱莉安用腿圈住他的腰

194
00:13:14,05 --> 00:13:17,62
Then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and stomach.
然后她扯开他的衣服 亲吻他的胸部、肚子

195
00:13:17,89 --> 00:13:22,02
Then he could use his teeth to undo her dress and...

196
00:13:22,23 --> 00:13:23,13

Something like that?
像这样？

200
00:13:37,55 --> 00:13:40,04
That's pretty much what I had in mind.
差不多

201
00:14:02,40 --> 00:14:05,30
It's a little early to be drinking.
现在喝酒太早了吧

202
00:14:06,84 --> 00:14:10,40
Things finally happened with Kate.

203
00:14:10,68 --> 00:14:12,51
You're kidding? That's great.

204
00:14:12,75 --> 00:14:14,04
It was so amazing.
感觉好棒

205
00:14:14,42 --> 00:14:16,61
After the lovemaking...
做完爱之后…

206
00:14:16,82 --> 00:14:17,75

天哪

00:14:19,65 --> 00:14:22,82
... I just watched her sleep for hours.
我看着她睡觉看了好久

208
00:14:23,06 --> 00:14:24,49
Just breathing in...
就这样吸气…

209
00:14:24,73 --> 00:14:26,56
...and breathing out.
吐气

210
00:14:27,26 --> 00:14:28,85
I knew she was dreaming because...
我知道她在做梦，因为…

211
00:14:29,10 --> 00:14:31,39
... her eyes kept going like this.
她的眼睛一直这样

212
00:14:37,67 --> 00:14:39,83
I'm telling you, she's got it all wrong.
她完全误会了

213
00:14:40,04 --> 00:14:43,53
All I said was,"This was fun. Let's do it again sometime.
我只是说 今晚很愉快，改天再聚

214
00:14:43,84 --> 00:14:45,00
I'll give you a call."
我再打给你

215
00:14:46,85 --> 00:14:49,75
I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
那她为什么觉得你会打给她？

216
00:14:50,55 --> 00:14:52,42
It's what you say at the end of a date.
约完会都要这么说

217
00:14:52,65 --> 00:14:55,45
You can't just say, "Nice to meet you. Good night?"
你就不能说 很高兴认识你，晚安？

218
00:14:55,99 --> 00:14:57,29
To her face?
当着她的面？

219
00:14:59,33 --> 00:15:00,99
I'm standing there...
一个晚上结束了

220
00:15:01,26 --> 00:15:03,56
...she's waiting for me to say I'll call her...

221
00:15:03,83 --> 00:15:06,10
...and it comes out. I can't help it.
所以我就说了，我没办法

222
00:15:06,30 --> 00:15:07,32
It's a compulsion.
我不由自主

223
00:15:09,07 --> 00:15:13,80
When a guy says he'll call, it doesn't mean he's going to call.
男人说要联络也不见得会联络

224
00:15:14,17 --> 00:15:16,14
This never happened to you?
你没碰过？

225
00:15:16,41 --> 00:15:18,31
Well,they always called.
他们都会打给我

226
00:15:19,58 --> 00:15:20,81

00:15:27,29 --> 00:15:29,48
-Did he call? -No,sorry.
他有打来吗？ 没有，对不起

228
00:15:29,76 --> 00:15:32,95
Why? He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
为什么？他说要打来 怎么还不打来？

229
00:15:33,19 --> 00:15:37,29
Maybe he's intimidated by smart, strong,successful women.
也许被你的美丽、成功吓到了

230
00:15:37,70 --> 00:15:40,43
Sophie,will you please climb out of my butt.
苏菲，不要拍我的马屁

231
00:15:42,34 --> 00:15:44,67
Why hasn't he called,Rachel? Why?
他为什么还不打来？

232
00:15:46,67 --> 00:15:50,20
Maybe he feels awkward because you're my boss.
也许他会尴尬 因为你是我的上司

233
00:15:50,44 --> 00:15:53,44
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
尴尬？为什么要尴尬？

234
00:15:53,68 --> 00:15:56,21
You didn't tell him not to call me,did you?
你没叫他不要打给我吧？

235
00:15:56,88 --> 00:15:59,44
If you're uncomfortable with your friend dating me...
要是你不喜欢你朋友跟我约会

236
00:15:59,69 --> 00:16:02,18
...there are always ways to fix that.
我们可以想办法解决

237
00:16:05,63 --> 00:16:07,65
Call her. Call her now!
现在就打给她

238
00:16:09,06 --> 00:16:11,69
Multiple so many paper cuts.
我满手都被纸割伤了

239
00:16:12,87 --> 00:16:16,93
"Why hasn't he called,Rachel? Why,why? I don't understand!"
他为什么还不打来？ 为什么？我不懂

240
00:16:17,14 --> 00:16:20,50
I'm telling you,she's flipped out! She's gone crazy!
她很激动，她快疯了

241
00:16:21,51 --> 00:16:23,57
Well,give me the phone then.
把电话拿来

242
00:16:24,14 --> 00:16:26,84
She thinks it's my fault you haven't called her.
她觉得你不联络是我的错

243
00:16:27,08 --> 00:16:28,38
You have to call her.
你一定要打给她

244
00:16:28,65 --> 00:16:30,71
You can't call somebody after this long to say:
总不能过了这么久才打去说

245
00:16:30,99 --> 00:16:34,22
"In case you didn't notice, I don't like you."
你或许没发现，我不喜欢你

246
00:16:34,56 --> 00:16:36,42
Then you'll have to take her out again.
那就再带她出去一次

247
00:16:37,39 --> 00:16:39,42
She's really dull, and she gets this...
不要，她很无聊，而且在眼角

248
00:16:39,69 --> 00:16:43,82
...gross mascara-goop thing in the corner of her eye!
有一大块睫毛膏印子

249
00:16:45,23 --> 00:16:46,32
I don't care!
我不管

250
00:16:46,57 --> 00:16:48,50
You'll take her out again and end it...
你再约她一次，把话说清楚

251
00:16:48,74 --> 00:16:51,10
...in a way she knows it's ended.
让她知道没希望

252
00:16:51,41 --> 00:16:55,17
I don't care how hard it is. Don't tell her you'll call her again!
不管有多困难 千万别说你会再联络

253
00:16:55,58 --> 00:16:56,41
All right,fine!
好

254
00:16:56,68 --> 00:16:59,87
But just lunch. From now on,I get my own dates.
但只能吃午餐 以后我自己泡马子

255
00:17:00,11 --> 00:17:02,24
I don't want you setting me up again!
你不要再帮我牵线了

256
00:17:02,52 --> 00:17:03,45
That's fine!
没问题

257
00:17:04,95 --> 00:17:07,58
-That's just a lot of big talk. -I know.
我只是说说 我知道

258
00:17:11,39 --> 00:17:13,42
I'm in the shower!

00:17:26,37 --> 00:17:27,93
Fire! There's a fire! Fire!

260
00:18:03,34 --> 00:18:07,25
I talked to Lauren. I told her how things were with us.

Did you talk to Marshall?

262
00:18:10,32 --> 00:18:11,41
About what?
说什么？

263
00:18:12,75 --> 00:18:15,02
About what happened with us.
我们之间的事

264
00:18:17,49 --> 00:18:21,19
No,there's really no reason why he should find out.
没有，他没有必要知道

265
00:18:21,46 --> 00:18:24,16
So let's not make a big deal out of it,okay?
我们就别小题大作了

266
00:18:26,13 --> 00:18:27,86
What are you talking about?
你在说什么？

267
00:18:28,14 --> 00:18:30,30
It was a big deal.
什么小题大作？

268
00:18:31,67 --> 00:18:34,64
You can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.
别说昨晚对你毫无意义

269
00:18:34,84 --> 00:18:38,18
I was there. You're not that good an actress.

270
00:18:41,25 --> 00:18:43,51
I was just caught up in the moment.
我只是一时激情

271
00:18:43,75 --> 00:18:45,48
That's all it was.
就这样

272
00:18:46,59 --> 00:18:49,42
Joey,I'm sorry you feel bad,but...
抱歉让你觉得不好过

273
00:18:49,66 --> 00:18:53,59
... haven't you slept with a woman and it meant more to her than to you?
你也曾经给别人这种感受吧？

274
00:19:01,90 --> 00:19:03,06
Hi,pig!
王八蛋

275
00:19:07,71 --> 00:19:09,94
Sorry I scared you in there.
抱歉吓到你了

276
00:19:10,28 --> 00:19:11,84
It's okay.
没关系

277
00:19:12,81 --> 00:19:13,80
By the way...
对了…

278
00:19:14,11 --> 00:19:17,17
... I was just checking the shower massager.

I tried to reach you at work.

What happened?
怎么了？

283
