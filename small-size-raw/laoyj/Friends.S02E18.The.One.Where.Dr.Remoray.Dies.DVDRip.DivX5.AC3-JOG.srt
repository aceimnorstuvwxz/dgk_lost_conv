Well,it wasn't that many guys.

If you consider how many guys there actually are...

...it's a very small percentage.

That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.

All it really was was just meaningless,animal sex.

Would you look at what I'm doing?

191
00:11:23,04 --> 00:11:24,51
Now that can't be smart.
