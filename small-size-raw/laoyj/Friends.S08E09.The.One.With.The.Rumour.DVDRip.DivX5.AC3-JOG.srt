You fall for it every time.

你看，宝宝越长越大 它们也会跟着撑开来

It goes back to the first Thanksgiving when the lndians sat down with the cowboys.
这得回溯至第一次过感恩节时 印第安人跟牛仔坐在一起

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,090
Oh, right. That's when they had that big rodeo at Plymouth Rock.
对，那个时候 他们在普利茅斯石办牛仔表演

不只是菲比，威尔还在节食 钱德不吃感恩节食物…

Yeah. Remember? I had to leave the other day when you had that chicken.
对，记得吗？ 那天你吃鸡肉时我得走开

32
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,370
I thought that was because I put the whole thing..
我以为那是因为 我手里…

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,740
on my hand and made it walk across the table.
拿着鸡要他在桌上走的关系

34

It's not worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. It's a lot of work.
为了三个人做一只火鸡太不划算了 那真的很费功夫

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,580
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
但感恩节一定要吃火鸡啊

36

Thanksgiving with no turkey is like Fourth of July with no apple pie.
感恩节不吃火鸡 就像国庆日不吃苹果派

37
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,950
Or Friday with no two pizzas.
或是星期五不吃两个披萨

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,590
Fine, if it means that much to you. But there's gonna be a ton left over.
好吧，如果它真的对你很重要 但到时候一定会剩下很多

No. I promise I will finish that turkey.
不，我发誓我会把那只火鸡吃完

40
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,470
You're telling me you can eat almost an entire turkey in one sitting?
你是说你可以一次 吃掉一整只火鸡？

41
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,640
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani! This is what we do.
没错，因为我是崔比亚尼家的人 这是我们的专长

42
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,850
We may not be great thinkers or world leaders..
我们不是伟大的思想家 或世界领袖…

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,820
we don't read a lot or run fast, but damn it, we can eat!
我们书念的不多，跑不快 但该死，我们是大胃王
