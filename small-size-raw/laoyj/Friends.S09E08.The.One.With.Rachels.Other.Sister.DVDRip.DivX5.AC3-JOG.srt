So it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it. For example..
不止是你说的谎言本身 你说的方式也很重要，例如…

146
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,420
if you look at the ground when you talk, people know you're lying.
如果你说的时候看着地上 人们就知道你在说谎

我不知道为什么这对我如此困难 说谎基本上就跟演戏一样

-而我可是演技精湛的演员 -你是演技精湛的演员

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,770
I could talk to the producers for you. I'm a great liar.
我可以帮你跟制作人说 我可是说谎高手

Thank you, Amy.

157
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,760
No, no, then I would get the baby.
然后我就可以得到婴儿

158
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,270
It would be just like a movie. At first I wouldn't know what to do with her.
就像是电影情节一样 刚开始我会全无头绪

159
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,570
And then I would rise to the occasion. Then I'd get a makeover and get married.
然后时机来临时 我会完全改变，然后结婚去

160
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,110
That's a great movie!

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,310
because you know, you'd be dead.

I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.

165
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,620
Emma.

Emma? Ross wants you.
艾犸？罗斯在叫你

167
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,690

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,990
Why does she keep making that noise?
她为什么一直发出那种怪声呢？

Honey, I don't know how to tell you this..

- Who? - You're in their apartment.
-谁？ -我们正在他们的公寓里

喔，我的天，我真是太感动了

and I don't get your baby?

艾美，我们跟摩妮卡跟钱德比较亲近

180
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,840
We see them every day. And truthfully, you don't seem connected to the baby.
我们每天都见面，而且老实说 你好像也不太亲近婴儿

181
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,610
Connected? To what? She's a lump.
亲近？亲近什么？ 她只是一堆肉

182

You know, guys, I've gotta say this means so much to me.
我必须要跟你们说 这对我意义重大

183
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,590

我是说，你们肯相信我 托负你们的孩子给我

185
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,890
trying to have a baby of our own.
想要生小孩

189
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,300
Seriously?

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,950
Okay, it's time for dinner.

Everyone, we're using our fancy china..

and it's very expensive, so please be careful.
它们是很贵的，所以请小心

193
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,460
Okay, just to be clear, comedy with the plates will not be well-received.
好了，再说明一次 不要拿这些盘子开玩笑

194
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,870
Hey!
嘿

195
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,980
How come my plate's less fancy than everyone else's?
为什么我的盘子不如别人的精致？

196
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,680
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?

No, honey. That's a special plate.
不，亲爱的，那是特别的盘子

I can't believe I won!
我不敢相信我赢了！

You know, this is such a slap in the face. I mean, I'm your sister..
这真的很侮辱，我是你妹妹…

201
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,570
and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
你却可以把婴儿给这些陌生人而不给我

202
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,300
Monica is Ross' sister.

203
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,640
No, Ross' sister was really fat.

That was me.

不，她是个蠢蠢的女生 在学校时就像小狗一样跟着瑞秋

Amy, you've got to stop doing that!
艾美，我不许你再这样了！

207
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,260
Okay, listen, I know you're having a bit of a family crisis..
好了，我知道你现在正在经历家庭危机

208

但是你不需要把气出在盘子身上

209

should cut their food like this:

212
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,580
and let's face it, you have fun.

and the crazy plate lady dies..

-那我可以得到婴儿吗？ -不，如果疯狂盘子女士…

216

If Monica dies, then I would get Emma. Right?
如果摩妮卡死了 那艾犸就是我的了，对吗？

217
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,200
- Well, actually.. - Actually what?
-嗯，其实… -怎样？

218
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,780
It's just.. It's just that in that case..
只是… 如果是那样的话…

219
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,880
then Emma would go to my parents.
那艾犸就会去跟我父母亲住

220
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,510
- What? - Hurts, doesn't it?
-什么？ -很伤你的心，对不对？

Who has to die for me to get her?
我要等谁死了才能得到她？

222
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,160
So if Monica's not around, I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
所以如果摩妮卡不在了 我就没有资格抚养艾犸了？

223
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,770
No, that is not what we're saying.

那我有什么不好的呢？我无能吗？

因为无论是什么东西杀了你们三个 我都存活了下来！

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,940
You're taking this the wrong way. We think you are going to be a wonderful parent.
你反应过度了 我们认为你会是很好的父亲

228
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,780

No, you're all about the fun.
不，你真的很好玩

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,470
I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?

No. You both are equally capable.

236
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,140
It's just you're strongest when you're together.
只不过你们在一起的时候是最强的

237
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,220
Okay. So if we both had Emma, and I died..
好的，如果我们有艾犸，然后我死了…

238
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,590
she'd have to give her up.
她也不能拥有她

239

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,370
I lie better than that, right?
我说谎说的至少比他好，对吧？

241
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,700
Let me just get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma.
让我搞清楚，如果我的两个朋友死了 我得到艾犸

242
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,970
Then my wife dies. Then Emma, the one tiny ray of hope left in my life..
然后我老婆死了，那我生命中剩下的 唯一一小块希望，艾犸…

Was there a child to raise poorly?
有婴儿需要被无能的父亲抚养长大吗？

247
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,930
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're saying.
罗斯跟瑞秋根本什么都不懂

248
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,000
It's not like they're so responsible.
他们自己也不是多有责任感

249
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,630
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five-year-old condom.
艾犸只不过是一瓶红酒 跟一个过期保险套的产品

250
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,470

不，他们是对的，我不是强悍的父亲 我永远都不会是

251
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,340

不，这些是要学习的 你会逐渐学会的

Yeah, but it's not who I am.
是的，但那就不是我了

253
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,680
Everything they said is exactly why I was worried about having a kid. And it's true.
