Why is everybody using these tiny,little lights nowadays?

I remember when people used big ones.

Wow. Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree?

Did someone get her drunk again,or...?
谁又把她灌醉了吗？

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,810
Having a perfect tree is not what Christmas is about.
圣诞节的意义不在于圣诞树 

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,950
It's about being with loved ones.

That is nice. And we're done. Ta-da!

It just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
我总觉得它少了一股圣诞味

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,560
Oh,here.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,630
See,now it feels like Christmas.
这样才像圣诞节

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,600

Some people trace the Christmas tree to the Egyptians...

who'd bring palm branches into huts on the shortest day of the year...
在每年白画最短的日子 他们会把棕榈枝带进屋里

Around the same time that you started this story.

20

-Hey,you guys. -Hey. What's up?
你们好 乔伊

21
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,410
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine's stretching all over.
我不出门不行 吉宁到处拉筋

24
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,700
Everywhere I look she's like....
一转头就看到她在…

25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,550
I can see why that's hard to resist.
难怪你无法抗拒

I like her so much.

30
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,630
You are aware that she's not a monkey,right?
你知道她不是猴子吧？

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,230
I am so over Janine.
我已经不在乎吉宁了

32
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,940
Yeah,at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news.
我原本觉得她很火辣 现在她已经成了过去式

33
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,910
-Hey,guys. -Janine!
你们好 吉宁

Oh,my God, we love that show!

从我有记忆以来 罗斯和我每年都看

What'd you guys do to get up on there?

We learned how to dance.

-Hey,you're a good dancer. -Really?

I don't see it.

Monica would not hide the presents down here.

我可以去套他，他很喜欢我

That's not fair to play with his head, though. You do it.
这样利用他不公平，还是你去 

208
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,110

Getting to be that holiday time again,huh?

Man,this sucks.
真讨厌

221
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,560
If Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them jealous...
要是跟爸妈爱现完却没上电视 

222
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,990
then who's gonna be the losers then?

We haven't done the routine since middle school.

Was it that good?

We got honorable mention in the brother/sister dance category!

接下来该谁上平台还用问吗？

236
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,360
You get up there and do that again, exactly like that.
不用，你们上去照样再跳一遍

237
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,260
Get this. Dick will want it for the Bloopers show.

I thought maybe they could help us find the presents.

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,940
I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage.
什么样的回礼能跟垃圾一样好

279
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,540
How about my "az"?
我的AZ如何？

280
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,020
-Hey. This is hollow. -What?
这是空的 什么？ 

282
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,960
This bench,it's hollow. I can't believe I never knew that!
这排座椅是空心的 我居然都不知道

284
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,890
-Oh,the presents! -Don't look directly at them!
我们的礼物 不！不要直视它们

285
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,930

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,600
All right,no,we could look at them.

This one's for Chandler. Here.

大包的是我的 赶快拆来看

等等，我们不能这样 为什么？ 

292

I don't want to know what Monica got me.
我不想知道摩妮卡送我什么

293
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,420
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it and wanting to surprise me.
她一定很用心的替我找礼物 想给我惊喜

294
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,650
And you guys are gonna ruin that.
你们这样会坏事

295
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,190
We have to put these back. This is not what Christmas is about.
我们得把礼物放回去 这样不叫圣诞节

296
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,660
Whatever,Linus. I'm opening mine.
谁理你，我要拆我的

297
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,830
Nobody is opening anything, okay?
谁也不准拆

298
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,840
I want to see the look on her face when I give her my present.
我不知道你们怎么想 但我想看摩妮卡收到我礼物的表情

300
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,600

她一定也想看 我收到礼物的表情

所以求求你们放回去

302
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,050
-Will you get us better gifts? -Fine.
你会送我们更好的礼物吗？ 好啦

303

304
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,520
You found the presents?

305
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,960
You let them find the presents?

Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
你知道那个滤水器多难找吗？

Nice to get back to reality.

Plus,we know how the New Year's gonna go off.
我们也知道新年会怎样了

312
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,660
I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic,you know?
千禧虫根本没什么，对吧？

313
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,330
Anyway,good night.

-Joey? -Yeah?

What was that for?
这是干什么？

319
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,260
Tonight when they yelled "cut" and we didn't get to kiss...
今晚当他们喊卡 我们没能接吻

320
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,420
I was really,really disappointed, and I just....
我真的很失望 我真的…

322
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,920
I just really wanted to kiss you.
真的很想亲你 

323
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
Really?
真的？

324
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,270
In the moment,I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
那时候我也很想亲你… 那时候

325
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,210
-In the moment. -But only in the moment.

326
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,440
So do you want to kiss again?
你…想再亲一次吗？

327
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,380
Sure. New Year's Eve is only two weeks away.
想啊，离除夕只有2个星期

328
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,810
Can you wait?
你能等吗？ 

329
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,720
No.
不能

330
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,790
Me neither.
我也是

331
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,760
Three,two....
3，2…

332
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,300
You don't have to count down every time we kiss.
不必每次接吻都倒数 

333
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,470
Oh. Okay.
好

334
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,500
Except I sort of felt like I needed a couple seconds to get ready.
但我觉得我需要几秒钟做准备

335
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,690
We were on the platform,ready to dance into the new millennium...
我们在平台上 准备带全世界跳进千禧年

336
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,640
and the guy yells,"Cut!"
那砘锶春傲丝

337
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,540
-So Joey didn't get to kiss Janine? -Nope,he sure didn't.
所以乔伊也没亲到吉宁？ 当然没有

338
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,240
I guess that means that you guys are still tied.
所以你和乔伊还是平分秋色罗

339
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,480
I don't know about that. I think she saw us do our routine.
那可不见得 她应该看到我们的招牌舞了

340
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,320
I may have boogied right into first place.
我用布吉舞步打头阵

341
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,790
So you guys are telling me that you actually did...
等等，你们真的跳了 

342
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,560
the routine from eighth grade?
八年级的招牌舞？

343
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,330
Yeah! But of course we had to update it a little bit.
对，不过当然得稍做修正

344
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,510
Hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me.
你反应真快，知道要接住我

345
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,400
There's no way you could've done the end...
我正想说 你们绝不可能...

346
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,010
the way you guys did it back then.
照以前的结尾跳

347
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,470
What? We could do it.
什么？当然可以

348
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,690
I don't know. You were a lot bigger.. I mean,stronger back then.
不行吧，你以前胖…壮多了

349
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,290
I can do it,okay?
我可以，好吗？

350
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,030
Come on,let's go! Come on.

351
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,990
One,two,three,four...
一二三四

352
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,790
five,six,seven,eight.
五六七八

353
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,520
I can't do it!
我不行

354
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,000
Now,you do that,you're on TV.
那样跳就能上电视了

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
