My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.

Yes,I did.

It was the guy who controls the robot.
不是机器人，是操作它的人

I may have to. I hate to do it. But I'm the star,you know?
搞不好我会 我也不想，但我是主角

韦恩，你老实说 我一直听说我会被换掉

其实我是大一，她是高三 所以没那么…

269
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,980
Look. I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs.
罗斯，我知道我一直找你麻烦

270
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,380
It's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie...

and partly because they just keep coming to me.

I admit after all the wonderful things Lizzie told me...
