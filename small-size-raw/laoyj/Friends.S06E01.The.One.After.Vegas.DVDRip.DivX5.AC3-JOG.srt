to where they have the marriages" thing? I love you.

Last night we let the dice decide.

也许应该再让命运决定一次 我爱你

We left it up to fate.

怎样啦 你说会很好玩

We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.
结果我们开了6小时 你就睡了5个小时半

下一个休息站就换手 你给我一路开回去

And until then,you are going to sing to me...
现在你得唱歌给我听

195
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,200
I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
我还以为得加把劲说服你

196
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,070
Now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.

I don't know.

How is this going to affect you, really?

208
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,370
I mean,you fill some form out once in a while...
偶尔填表格要打勾时

It's right next to it.
就在“未婚”旁边

We can stay married...

-No, they're right.. -Ross!

please take a moment here...

他搞不好是强… 强暴犯或杀人犯什么的

你以为我没有先问过吗？

I've thought about how to tell you this.
我一直在想要怎么表达

247
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,150
I came up with an analogy about a little goldfish...

248
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,120
in a pond that freezes over in the winter...
在冬天冻死的比喻

249
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,630
but I realized that was a story about what to do when people pick on you.
后来又想到它是在谈 如何面对别人的挑剔

250

So I'm gonna actually save that for my children's book.
那个故事我打算写童话书时用

is we cannot stay married.
我们不能维持婚姻关系

你知道吗？

257
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,510
This is a difference of opinion.

263
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,070

264
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,410
is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
对了 有没有注销婚姻送礼会？

265
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,080
There's the train station. This is where I get off.
