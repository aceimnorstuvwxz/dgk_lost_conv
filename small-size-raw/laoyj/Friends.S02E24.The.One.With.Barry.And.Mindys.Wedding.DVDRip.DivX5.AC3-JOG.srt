00:09:23,02 --> 00:09:24,79
It could be like a big giant guy.
她有可能是个大猛汉哦

What's going on?
怎么了？

157
00:09:35,00 --> 00:09:37,27
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
我们正在猜 钱德的女友是不是女的

158
00:09:37,81 --> 00:09:39,77
Oh,well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live.
那就问她会活多久就可以了

159
00:09:40,37 --> 00:09:41,43
Women live longer than men.
女人比男人长寿

160
00:09:45,95 --> 00:09:47,85
How do you not fall down more?
你还真是笨得到家了

161
00:09:49,85 --> 00:09:52,75
Okay,ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
问她用什么方法避孕

162
00:09:53,49 --> 00:09:54,11
All right.
好吧

00:09:58,36 --> 00:10:00,85
"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."

I can't believe she's married.

我那天读到了一篇文章说 不应该在婚礼上丢米庆祝

170
00:10:26,99 --> 00:10:29,01
because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
因为鸽子吃了会死掉

171
00:10:29,26 --> 00:10:31,78
Oh,that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.
难怪寿司吧里都看不到鸽子

172
00:10:34,09 --> 00:10:35,76
- See,we're having fun. - Oh,absolutely.
你瞧，我们很开心 是啊

173
00:10:37,87 --> 00:10:41,20
Yeah,you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not going to be thinking about.
你知道，我们不要去想那件事 我根本连想都不想

174
00:10:41,44 --> 00:10:42,06
Neither am I.
我也是

175
00:10:43,57 --> 00:10:45,47
Hi,there. Are you all right?
你还好吗？

176
00:10:46,11 --> 00:10:50,27
Yeah,when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding,
我去洗手间的时候，
看到我结婚时爬出去的那扇窗

然后我开始想我不该来的

大家会打量我，评判我 然后就想到上一次的事

generally people focus on the bride.

181
00:11:04,26 --> 00:11:05,09
God I know,you're right.
天啊，我知道你说得对

182
00:11:05,29 --> 00:11:07,85
All rightie,everybody look at me. Good.

192
00:11:37,96 --> 00:11:41,42
I think the only thing that tops that was,was,
我想唯一比这个还要丢脸的…

193
00:11:41,63 --> 00:11:44,93
was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.
就是我八年级在全校面前唱 COPACABANA那次了

194
00:11:45,10 --> 00:11:47,66
I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.
我大概唱没两句就逃之夭夭了
