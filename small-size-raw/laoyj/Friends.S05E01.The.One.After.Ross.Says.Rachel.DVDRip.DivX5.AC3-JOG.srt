00:09:06,22 --> 00:09:07,95
Ross said my name up there.
他会说成我的名字 

153
00:09:08,16 --> 00:09:10,63
That obviously means he still loves me!
表示他还爱我

154
00:09:11,76 --> 00:09:13,75
Don't believe me. I know I'm right.
不信就算了，我绝对没误会

155
00:09:14,00 --> 00:09:16,13
Do you guys want to go and get a drink?
你们要不要下楼喝一杯？

156
00:09:16,40 --> 00:09:17,63
Yes,we do.
好啊，

157
00:09:19,34 --> 00:09:21,27
But we have to change first.
不过我们要先换衣服

158
00:09:21,51 --> 00:09:23,17
Yes,I want to change.
对，我想换衣服

159
00:09:24,48 --> 00:09:27,31
-Go get a table. -We'll only be five minutes.
你先下去孜蛔 我们五分钟就下去

160
00:09:27,58 --> 00:09:29,10
Fifteen minutes.
十五分钟吧

161
00:09:30,31 --> 00:09:31,21
好

162
00:09:34,85 --> 00:09:36,44
Oh,Phoebe! It's Phoebe!
喂，菲比啊，是菲比

163
00:09:36,65 --> 00:09:38,68
-Oh,hey,hey. -Oh,great.
是吗？ 太好了

164
00:09:38,02 --> 00:09:39,42
嗨

165
00:09:39,79 --> 00:09:41,09
So,what happened?
怎么样？

166
00:09:41,29 --> 00:09:42,78
Well,Ross said my name.
罗斯说成我的名字

167
00:09:43,53 --> 00:09:46,00
But I don't think that means anything.
我知道，不过他是无心的

168
00:09:46,20 --> 00:09:48,29
Let's look at this objectively.
菲比，我们冷静客观想想看

169
00:09:48,53 --> 00:09:49,97
Ninth grade,right?
他从国三就暗恋我

170
00:09:50,17 --> 00:09:51,63
The obsession starts.
那时就疯狂迷上我

171
00:09:53,77 --> 00:09:56,93
Then he sees me in a two-piece for the first time.
那年暑假 他头一次看我穿两件式

172
00:09:57,17 --> 00:09:59,44
His obsession begins to grow,right?
更是不可自拔爱上我

173
00:09:59,98 --> 00:10:01,88
Why don't we go change in my room?
去我房间换衣服好了

174
00:10:02,11 --> 00:10:03,51
My clothes are....
可是我的衣服在…

175
00:10:19,73 --> 00:10:20,86
Wow,you look
你看起来真是… 

176
00:10:21,13 --> 00:10:22,53
No time for that.
没时间废话了

177
00:10:26,64 --> 00:10:30,13
Hey,dude! Let me in! I got a girl out here!
老兄，让我进去，我有女伴

178
00:10:31,31 --> 00:10:32,90
I got a girl in here!
我也有

179
00:10:34,05 --> 00:10:37,24
No,you don't. I saw you go in with Monica.
才怪，我看到你跟摩妮卡进去

180
00:10:39,22 --> 00:10:41,21
Well,we're hanging out.
我们在里面聊天

181
00:10:42,32 --> 00:10:46,26
Which one of us will be having sex in there? Me or you?
你说我们谁有机会嘿咻？

182
00:10:46,89 --> 00:10:49,72
I suppose I would have to say you.
看来我只能说是你了

183
00:10:51,20 --> 00:10:54,26
-What if we're watching a movie? -Which we are!
可是我们正在看电视

184
00:10:54,53 --> 00:10:56,06
And we've paid for it.
没错，我们付费了 

185
00:10:56,33 --> 00:10:57,53
It's My Giant.
正在看“我的巨人”

186
00:10:58,84 --> 00:10:59,86
My Giant?
“我的巨人”？

00:11:00,07 --> 00:11:02,16
I love that movie!
我爱死那部片

188
00:11:07,18 --> 00:11:08,44
Think this is okay?
你确定这样好吗？

189
00:11:08,71 --> 00:11:11,55
Well,Ross and Emily aren't going to use it.
反正罗斯跟艾蜜莉也用不到

190
00:11:11,92 --> 00:11:14,04
Oh,it's so beautiful!
这里好漂亮

191
00:11:16,12 --> 00:11:17,85
I don't feel right about this.
可是我总觉得不太妥当

192
00:11:18,29 --> 00:11:20,99
小摩…听我说

193
00:11:20,93 --> 00:11:22,72
This is the honeymoon suite.
这是蜜月套房 

194
00:11:22,93 --> 00:11:25,36
The room expects sex.
本来就该有人在这里嘿咻

195
00:11:27,23 --> 00:11:30,76
The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
如果没有，这间房一定很失望

196
00:11:31,04 --> 00:11:34,80
All the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
在其他蜜月套房面前抬不起头

197
00:11:36,21 --> 00:11:37,47
好吧 那好

198
00:11:40,75 --> 00:11:42,98
Nope! Not under here!

你还没找到她？我到处都找不到

202
00:11:48,55 --> 00:11:51,15
You couldn't have, or you would've found her.
你一定漏掉什么地方 否则早就找到了

203
00:11:51,39 --> 00:11:54,09
-Keep looking! -Yeah! For about 30 minutes?
你应该继续找 大概再找个30分钟

205
00:11:54,29 --> 00:11:55,72
Or 45?
或是45分钟

206
00:11:58,46 --> 00:12:01,06
In 45 minutes, you could find her twice.
45分钟可以找到两次了

207
00:12:04,57 --> 00:12:09,63
For all I know,she's trying to find me but couldn't,because I kept moving.
不了，她一定也找不到我 因为我跑来跑去

208
00:12:09,94 --> 00:12:12,57
From now on, I'm staying in one place.
从现在开始我不动了 

209
00:12:12,81 --> 00:12:14,24
Right here.

-It's getting late. -We're going to go.
时间晚了 我们要走了

211
00:12:21,92 --> 00:12:24,58
Do you guys mind staying here for a while?
待一会儿如何？

212
00:12:25,92 --> 00:12:28,48
We've got to get up early and catch that plane.
可是我们明天一早 就要搭机回纽约（音同捕捉）

213
00:12:28,69 --> 00:12:30,68
Yeah,it's a very large plane.
而且那班飞机又很大

214
00:12:33,26 --> 00:12:34,70
That's cool.
那就算了

215
00:12:37,33 --> 00:12:39,83
But we'll stay here with you.
不过我们还是陪你一会

216
00:12:40,17 --> 00:12:41,64
Thanks,guys!

217
00:12:43,94 --> 00:12:48,00
I really appreciate this, but you don't need to rub my butt.

We have to leave in an hour.

219

I know. I've been looking at those doors.
我知道 我一直在看那扇门 

220
00:13:08,03 --> 00:13:10,97
They look pretty soundproof, don't you think?
隔音效果似乎很好

221
00:13:11,37 --> 00:13:13,67
We can't do that. That's insane.
不行，你疯了

222
00:13:13,97 --> 00:13:17,41
I mean,A,he could wake up. And B,you know...
第一，他可能醒来 第二，

223
00:13:17,68 --> 00:13:19,04
...Iet's go for it.
管他的 

224
00:13:24,22 --> 00:13:26,45

Nope.
不是她

227
00:13:32,09 --> 00:13:34,75
-She's not with us. -We've come for her things.

Where is she?
她在哪里？

229

She's in hiding. She's humiliated. She doesn't want to see you again.
她躲起来了，因为她很丢脸 这辈子都不想再见到你

230
00:13:41,93 --> 00:13:46,93
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily,monkey.
很遗憾你们两个闹成这样 兔崽子

231
00:13:48,57 --> 00:13:52,24
But I think you're absolutely delicious!
不过你实在是秀色可餐

232
00:13:52,91 --> 00:13:56,94
Excuse me, I'm standing right here.

There you are.

Hurry up! Get some! There's a whole cart outside.

Now,hold on. Hold on.

Your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon.
令媛跟我今晚预定去度蜜月

请你们转告她，我会去机场 我希望她也会去

240
00:14:21,37 --> 00:14:24,40
I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything.
我是说成瑞秋的名字 但这只是无心之过

241
00:14:24,68 --> 00:14:25,87
She's just a friend.
她不过是我的朋友

242
00:14:26,14 --> 00:14:27,91
Tell Emily I love her and...
就这样，请转告艾蜜莉 我爱她

...I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.

Please,promise me that you'll tell her that.

Call me.
打电话给我

248
00:14:43,66 --> 00:14:48,76
You spend your life in the bathroom. Why do you never go out the window?
你也一天到晚待在厕所 怎么就不会从窗户滚蛋

249
00:15:06,05 --> 00:15:09,18
Maybe it's best we never got to do it again.
或许我们不再上床才对

250
00:15:09,39 --> 00:15:12,51
Yeah,it kind of makes that one night special.
否则那晚就不特别了

251
00:15:16,36 --> 00:15:19,96
Technically,we still are over international waters.
理论上而言，我们还在海外

252
00:15:21,30 --> 00:15:25,03
I'm going to the bathroom. Maybe I'll see you there?
我去洗手间，待会来找我？

Can I ask you something?
我可以问个问题吗？

255
00:15:35,25 --> 00:15:36,41
不行

256
00:15:37,65 --> 00:15:41,71
Felicity and I watched My Giant. And I thought:
我昨晚跟费丽西蒂 一起看“我的巨人”

257
00:15:41,92 --> 00:15:45,18
"I'll never be as good an actor as that giant."
我心想：自己永远不可能 演得跟那个巨人一样棒

258
00:15:45,42 --> 00:15:49,05
Do you think I'm wasting my life with this acting thing?
我想当演员是否只是痴心妄想

259
00:15:50,83 --> 00:15:52,82
The giant's five years younger than me.

261
00:15:53,06 --> 00:15:54,93
You think I'll ever get there?
我有办法跟他一样优秀吗？

262
00:15:57,10 --> 00:15:58,50
会的

-Thanks,man. -Okay,man.

264
00:16:02,77 --> 00:16:05,71
But what about how much taller he is than me?
但是他比我高好多啊

266
00:16:06,61 --> 00:16:10,60
I mean,there's no way I can make myself taller now.
我现在已经不可能再长高

267
00:16:10,85 --> 00:16:14,58
Who knows what science will come up with in the future...
以后科学怎么发展我不知道

268
00:16:14,85 --> 00:16:18,55
...but what if I die an unsuccessful, regular-size man?
如果我死时只是一个 身高平庸的小人物呢？

269
00:16:20,59 --> 00:16:23,58
You've been in the bathroom for a half-hour.

No,we didn't.

00:16:54,63 --> 00:16:57,82
I know you didn't. I was talking about Monica.

278
00:16:59,26 --> 00:17:00,73
I did not have sex.
菲比，我才没跟人嘿咻

279
00:17:00,93 --> 00:17:05,99

281

我要去跟小鸡小鸭打招呼 我跟你去

你何必去？ 你不是四天都去喂它们？

284
00:17:12,31 --> 00:17:15,04
Oh,right. Maybe I'll just go home.
没错，我回家好了

285
00:17:25,82 --> 00:17:27,22
We certainly are alone.
只剩下我们两个

286
00:17:27,46 --> 00:17:30,29
Good thing we have that "not New York" rule.
幸好我们说好回纽约就不行

287
00:17:30,03 --> 00:17:31,19
没错

288
00:17:32,50 --> 00:17:35,56
Listen,since we're on that subject...
既然你说到这个

289
00:17:35,80 --> 00:17:38,46
...I just wanted to tell you that....
我想告诉你…

290
00:17:38,74 --> 00:17:41,73
I was going through a hard time in London...

291
00:17:41,97 --> 00:17:47,14
...with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.
因为哥哥结婚 别人还把我认作他妈

292
00:17:45,78 --> 00:17:47,27
我知道

293
00:17:48,41 --> 00:17:50,47
Well,anyway,I just....
那晚对我来说意义非凡

294
00:17:50,68 --> 00:17:54,17
That night meant a lot to me. And I'm trying to say thanks.

296
00:17:58,49 --> 00:18:00,98
You know,that night meant a lot to me too.
我那天也不是随便上床

297
00:18:01,26 --> 00:18:04,42
It wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything.

298
00:18:04,66 --> 00:18:07,82
It just meant a lot because you're really hot.

299
00:18:12,27 --> 00:18:13,29
Is that okay?

300
00:18:13,50 --> 00:18:14,84

00:18:15,87 --> 00:18:16,86
And I'm cute too?
而且我也很帅
