00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,620
I'm so bad at picking out clothes.
我实在是很不会挑选衣服

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,960
So you need someone who knows fashion to tell you what looks good.
所以你需要有很了解 时尚的人来给你建议

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,150
Not me. Not me. Not me.

-你可能很忙没空吧 -你在开玩笑吗？

Rachel loves to shop, and she has great taste.
瑞秋爱死逛街了，而且她品味极佳

-已经挂掉了，对吗？ -怎么了？菲比

Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight and he's gonna be there.
麦克的姐姐刚邀请我去今晚的派对 而且他也会去

25
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,540
She was like, "Don't worry. I asked him and he's totally okay with seeing you."
她说“别担心，我问过他了 他完全不介意见到你”

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,590
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally okay with seeing him.
所以现在我一定得去了 否则他会认为我很介意见到他

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,590
- Which you're not. You're hung up on him. - Exactly.
-你根本就很介意，你还没有忘记他 -没错

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,200
You want him to eat his heart out, so you have to look fabulous.
你想要他懊悔不已 所以你一定要看起来艳光四射

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,830
I didn't even think about that.
我根本没有那样想过

30
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,530
Sexual politics!
性欲权术！

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,770
Phoebe, I'm taking Charlie shopping.
菲比，我要带查莉去逛街

-我们没有要那样做 -你为何要这么说？我得罪谁了？

35
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,416

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,240
Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.
哇，还好她长的很漂亮

37
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,280
I still can't believe this. My uterus is an inhospitable environment?
我还是无法相信 我的子宫是不适着床的环境？

38
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,180
I've always tried so hard to be a good hostess.
我一直都很努力想要当个称职的女主人

39
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,250
I can't believe my sperm have low motility.
我不敢相信我的精子的活动力太低

40
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,090
While I was growing up, they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places.
当我在长大的时候 它们倒是等不及要到处去游玩

41
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,990
- Hi there. - Hi.
-嗨 -嗨

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,220
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your tests last week..
关于你们上星期的测试 我很抱歉，没有什么更好的消息

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,160
but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
但是我想要跟你们谈谈你们可有的选择

44
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,360
Okay.
好的

45
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,600
Even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great..
虽然你们以正常方式 受孕的机率很低…

46
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,400
you never know, so keep having sex on a regular basis.
但是很难定论的 所以你们还是持续进行性生活

47
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,600
Oh, damn it!
哎，是喔！

48
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,910
Don't worry. After a while, you'll tune it out.
别担心，等一下你就会习惯了

49

Given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success..
在这种情况之下，最佳的选择就是…

50
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,650

代理孕母或是经由捐赠精子受孕

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,030
If you feel that neither of those is right for you, you could always adopt.
如果你们认为上述两种选择都不适合 你们还是可以选择领养

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,860
Is that a hint?
这是个暗示吗？

53
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,700
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly, but we don't want you to be our child.
我们是挺热爱你的，唐纳利医生 但是我们不想要领养你

54
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,010
Wow! Talk about an inhospitable environment.
糟糕！说的话还真不受欢迎

63
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,010
Just seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist.
只是想了解一下 当古生物学家是怎样的

64
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,820

-我今天要跟他见面 -他是个蛮难伺候的人

68
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,550
I think I know how to dazzle him.
我想我知道要怎么迷惑他

69
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,690
You're not gonna to do a magic trick, are you?

如果是这样 我想邀请你们来听我的演讲

74
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,220
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work and/or are sick.
我想如果说我们都有家庭 工作或是身体不适等理由是没错的

75
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,750
- It's in Barbados. - But you come first.
-是在巴贝多 -但是你是最重要的

81
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,780
- So how did it go at the fertility clinic? - Not as much fun as last time.
-验孕诊所怎么说？ -不像上次一样好玩

82
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,410
Apparently, you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
很明显地，他们只有在采精子样本时 才会给你看色情书刊

83
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,120
So, what did the doctor say?
那医生怎么说呢？

84
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,990
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt her whole life of carrying a child..
可以用代理孕母，但摩妮卡这一辈子 都在梦想怀孕…

85
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,100
and she just felt that watching a surrogate would be too hard for her.
而她会觉得看着代理孕母怀孕 对她而言会太难受了

86
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,460
- So you're ruling out surrogacy? - Yeah.
-所以你们不考虑代理孕母？ -没错

87
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,620
So I don't have to learn what that means?
所以我不用知道那是什么意思？

88
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,870
Aside from adoption, the only other choice is insemination..
除了领养外，剩下的选择 就是接受精子捐赠

89
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,100
so we're talking about sperm donors.
所以我们现在在讨论精子捐赠者的事

90
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,970
Enough said. I'm there for you, man. Where is she, upstairs?
够了，我随时为你效劳，兄弟 她在哪？楼上吗？

91
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,280
Your long-standing offer to have sex with my wife is appreciated.
我是非常感激 你长期以来想跟我老婆上床的好意

92
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,220
- But I think I'll pass. - So how do you feel about all this?
-但是我想我心领了 -那你的感觉呢？

93
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,380
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child, but there isn't one.
我真希望我们有更简单的方式可生孩子 但是我们并没有选择

94
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,350
Come on, Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it.
别这样，罗斯，做做好人 挺身而出吧

95
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,990
What?
什么？

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,030
What?! No! I'm not gonna give them Ben!
什么？不！ 我不会把班给他们的！

97
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,270
The data we're receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing..
我们从磁共振造影跟脱氧核糖核酸测试 所取得的化石…

98
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,510
of these fossils are staggering.
资料数据是很惊人的

99
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given.
我的意思是我们一直以来都将 李奇年代法视为理所当然

100
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,350
But if they're off by even a 100,000 years or so..
但是如果它的误差 即使只有十万年左右…

101
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,360
then you can just throw most of our assumptions..
那你可以舍弃我们大部分推论…

102
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,790
you know, right in the trash.
你知道的，丢到垃圾桶里

103
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,060
So, what I'm saying is..
所以，我要说的是…

104
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,060
Is that..
是…

105
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,070
Is that repercussions could be huge.
是所受影响的后果是很大的

106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,970
I mean, not just in paleontology, but if you think about it..
我是说，不只是在古生物学 但是如果你仔细想想…

107
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,380
in evolutionary biology, genetics, geology.
甚至是在进化生物学、基因学、地质学

108
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,140
I mean, truly, the mind boggles.
我是说，真的，无限想像的空间

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,650
Well, that's not what you want.
嗯，结果不该是这样的

110
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,220
- Incentive for Men? - I'll take some of that.
-男人的动机？ -我要喷一点

111
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,060
- Phoebe, that's for men. - I know.
-菲比，那是男生的香水 -我知道

112
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,830
When I go to the party later..
在我等一下去派对时…

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Mike will know I'm over him because I'll smell like another guy.
麦克会知道我已经忘了他了 因为我闻起来会有另一个男人的味道

114
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,540
Okay.
好了

115
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,010
Oh, good, I'm dating a Russian cabdriver.
太好了，我在跟俄罗斯计程车司机约会

116
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,450
Seriously, does anyone buy this? I smell like beets.
拜托，有人买这个吗？ 这闻起来像是甜菜

117
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,020
I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads in them. Where are those?
我真的很喜欢那些有垫肩的外套 在哪边有呢？

118
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,420
On Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.
梅兰妮葛丽芬在《上班女郎》里面穿的

119
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,290
I think what you want is over here.

对了，为了要谢谢你 我真的很想请你吃饭
