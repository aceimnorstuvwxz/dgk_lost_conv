142
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,190
And I got the duck totally trained too.

143
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,760
Stare at the wall.

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,660

Be white.

00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,540
I had fun tonight.
今晚很愉快

派对办得很棒 谢了，很高兴认识你

150
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,850
If any of my friends ever get married or have a birthday or a Tuesday....
要是我有朋友要结婚 或是过生日、过星期日…

151
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,290
Yeah,that'd be great.
那就太好了

152
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,920
So,I guess,good night.
那就再见了

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,630
Unless you want to hang around.

I'll let you play with my duck.
对，你可以跟我的鸭子玩

156
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,980
Stripper!
跳脱衣舞的

157
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,830
The stripper stole the ring!
舞娘把戒指偷走了

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,730
Chandler,get up! The stripper stole the ring!

-What? -The ring is gone!

160
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,840
Just give me a minute to wake up for this.
先让我清醒一下

161
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,510
You lost the ring. You're the worst best man!
你把戒指弄丢了 你是最烂的伴O

162
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,950
This isn't funny. I go to sleep,everything's cool.
不好笑，怎么办？ 我去睡觉，一切正常

163
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,180
I wake up,the stripper's gone, and the ring is gone!
等我醒来，舞娘不见了 戒指也不见了

164
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,330
-You slept with her? -Of course!
你跟她上床？ 废话

165
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,200
-Hi,guys. -Hi,Phoebe.
你们两个 菲比

166
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,170
I wanted to apologize if I seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.
我想说声抱歉 我昨天在送礼会上似乎凶了点

167
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,170
Just the hormones.
荷尔蒙作崇

168
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,740
-No,we -Hormones.
别这样，我们…  荷尔蒙嘛

169
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,010
I wanted to say thank you. It was so sweet.
谢谢你们，你们真有心

170
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,620
You seem to be doing much better.

171
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,020
-How are things going? -Good.
你现在怎样？ 很好

172
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,260
Everything's been about me lately. So what's happening with you?
最近的注意力都在我 你们呢？

173
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,030
We were just talking about me not going to Ross' wedding.
我们正在说 我不去参加罗斯的婚礼

174
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,040
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that.
有那段过往 我可能很难面对

175
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,210
This reminds me of the time when I lived on the street.
这让我想起当年流落街头时

176
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,680
This guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
有人说我陪他上床就请我吃饭

177
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,610
How is this like that?
这两件事哪里像？

178
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,790
Well,let's see. It's not really like that.
我想想…的确不像

179
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,500
Because that was an actual problem.
因为那才算是问题

180
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,220
And yours is just a bunch of high-school crap...
你这只是高中女生无病呻吟 

181
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,130
...that nobody really gives!
没人在乎

182
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,400
I'm sorry. I just thought
抱歉，我只是…

183
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,150
Here come the water works.
泪眼攻势来了

184
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,940
I called the company that sent her, and they don't care.
我已经没辄了 我打给仲介站，他们不管

185
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,350
I called 911 and they yelled at me. This is an emergency!
我打119又被吼 这还不算紧急事件吗？

186
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,950
I really wanna help you out, but I got plans to go see Titanic...
我真的很想帮忙 但我打算去看“铁达尼号”

187
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,060
...so I've got to call 911 to find out what time it starts.
所以我要打119问场次

188
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,920
Hey,guys.
我来了

189
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,600
Thanks again for last night. What a great party.
谢谢你，派对办得很棒 

190
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,540
The guys from work had a blast.
博物馆那伙人玩得很爽

191
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,770
One of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
其中有一个没参加过单身派对

192
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,070
Another one had never been to a party before.
另一个没参加过派对

193
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,250
So that wedding ring.
那个结婚戒指

194
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,650
-Man,that is nice. -Yeah,right?
可真漂亮 漂亮吧

195
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,620
I might pick one of those babies up for myself.
我也想买一个

196
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,560
Where might one get one of those?
要去哪里买？

197
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,720
When my grandmother first came to this country...
那个戒指？ 我奶奶刚来到这个国家时

199
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,800
...that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
全身上下只有那只戒指 和一小包衣服

200
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,140
So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.
所以那只戒指可说是无可取代

201
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,140
Absolutely. It's been in my family for generations.
当然，它是我家的传家宝

202
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,150
Every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
每个戴上它的新娘 都能幸福到老

203
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,450
So you might say it's a magic ring.
所以简直算是一只魔戒

204
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,560
Yeah,the stripper stole it.
被脱衣舞娘偷了

205
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,990
What?
什么？

206
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,760
-What did you just -I think I heard what he said.
你刚才说… 我想我听到了

207
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,100
I believe it was, "The stripper stole the ring."
应该是说… “被脱衣舞娘偷了”

209
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,040
My ring? My wedding ring?
偷了我的戒指？我的结婚戒指？ 

210
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,310
The stripper stole my wedding ring?
脱衣舞娘偷了我的结婚戒指？

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,580
How could this happen?
怎么会这样？

212
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,880
It all started when you said, "Joey,you be my best man!"
原因就在于你说了 “乔伊，你来当我的伴O吧”

213
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,990
All right. I'm going to call the cops.
好，我来报警

214
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,560
I screwed up. But you don't have to turn me in.
我搞砸了你也不用报官捉我

215
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,740
-Not on you,on the stripper. -I already did that.
不是捉你，是捉那个舞娘 我试过了 

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
They said they'd look into it after they solve all the murders.
他们说等侦破所有谋杀案再说

217
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,770
-We'll call the company that sent her. -I did that too.
那就找仲介站 我也试过了 

218
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,740
They wouldn't give me her real name.
他们不肯透露她的真名或电话

219
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,110
They said if I bother them again, they'd call the police.
他们说我再打去就要报警

220
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,410
I said,"You talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring."
我说“你去啊” “就说我掉了一只戒指”

221
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,450
So,what are you telling me?

222
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,210
There's nothing we can do?
难道一点办法也没有？

223
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:01,260
-How could this happen? -Look,Ross,I am so sorry.
怎么会这样？ 罗斯，我真的很抱歉

225
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,590
What if we just called her...
我们可以再叫她一次 

226
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,790
...used a fake name and had her come to my office?
用假名把她找去我的办公室

227
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,510
That sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!
好像不赖，但我们得找戒指

228
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,270
Here's your tea,Phoebe.
菲比，你的茶

229
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,310
It's so good.

231
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,760
-Good. -So glad you like it.
那就好 你喜欢就好

232
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,560
What? She made the tea.
怎样？茶是她泡的

233
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,770
I think I just had a contraction.
不是，我刚才阵痛了

234
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,930
-What? -My God!
什么？ 天哪

235
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,330
I felt one a few minutes ago.
几分钟前就有一次 

236
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,470
That definitely was one.
这次绝对错不了

237
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,340
You can't have the baby here.
你不能在这里生 

238
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,140
I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!
男生搬走之后我还没消毒

239
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,310
It's okay. I'll boil some water and rip up some sheets.
没事，别怕，我来烧水撕床单

240
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,550
It's probably false labor.
别紧张，可能是假性阵痛

241
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,090
That can happen near the end. Just get the book.
接近预产期会这样，去拿书来

242
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,130
-Get the book! -The book!
瑞秋，拿书来 书，好

243
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,700
-The Bible? -I don't know!
圣经？ 我哪知啊

244
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,940
All right. This is great.
好，很好

245
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,870
You get behind the desk.

When she comes in, she won't recognize you because

247
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,410
Well,why would she?

248
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,280
And then you buzz Ross and l.
然后你对罗斯和我打暗号

249

You be Mr. Gonzales, and I'll be Mr. Wong.
