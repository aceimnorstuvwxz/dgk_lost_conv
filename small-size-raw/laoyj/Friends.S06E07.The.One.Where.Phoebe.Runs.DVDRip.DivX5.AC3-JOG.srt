00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,800
It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
我的丁字裤很娇贵，不能烘干

141
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,480
Oh,yeah,it's me.
没错，是我 

142
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,780
I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.
我看到你抄了慢跑鞋溜出来

143
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,290
You lied so you could run by yourself.
你骗我好自己跑步

144
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,550
No,Phoebe,no. I was....
不是，我没有 我是…

145
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,420
I was actually just checking...
我只是跑跑看… 

146
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,790
to see...

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,760
if I could run. And I can!
看我能不能跑，结果可以

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,440
Please,I'm not an idiot.
拜托，我又不是白痴 

149
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,000
No,wait. Phoebe?
等等，菲比

150
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,650
Wow. Couples who live together do start to look alike.
同居真的会让人越来越像

151
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,090
I am working right now. So say what you have to say and leave me alone!
我在忙，有话快说，有屁快放

152
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,750
Sound alike too.
口气也很像

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,860
So,Mondler....
摩德…

154
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,400
What are you doing?
你在干什么？ 

155
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,800
What does it look like? I am cleaning.
你说呢？我在打扫

156
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,370
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all her stuff?
你动她的东西有经过她同意吗

157
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,180
I don't need that. I'll put everything back.
没必要，我会把东西都放回去

158
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,680
Put it back exactly where you found it?
完全恢复原状吗？

159
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,150
Yes. I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
当然是完全恢复原状

160
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,910
First of all, that attitude is not helping.
这种态度对你没有帮助

161
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,490
She won't care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
她才不会在乎有没有恢复原状

162
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,220
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?
你是刚认识摩妮卡吗？

163
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,230
She'll recognize that I did a nice thing...
她会认同我的体帖...

164
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,160
and appreciate it.
并感到窝心

165
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,860
Actually,this will work out well.
其实这样也蛮好的

166
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,010
Because when you move back with Joey...
等你必须搬回去跟乔伊住 

167
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,230
Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me.
乔伊的新室友就可以来跟我住

168
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,370
Oh,I see. You're trying to freak me out.
我懂了，你想吓我

169
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,210
Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right?
钱德，摩妮卡对这种事有怪癖

170
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,120
Believe me,I lived with her for 16 years. She's going to freak out.
相信我，我跟她住了16年 她会捉狂

171
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,850
Oh,my God. She's going to sit on you.
天哪，她会压在你身上

172
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,220
That probably won't hurt as much anymore.
不过她现在瘦了

173
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,020
No,she is not. I'll prove it to you.
她才不会，我证明给你看 

174
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,990
I'll call her right now.
我现在就打给她

175
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,700
Phone's done.
电话擦好了

176
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,900
-Hey,Mon. How's it going? -Terrible.
摩妮卡，你好吗？ 烂透了

177
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,470
If I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
什么事都得我自己来 

178
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,370
Other people just wreck stuff.
其他人只会搞砸

179
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,480
I think I might kill someone tonight.
我今晚可能会杀人

180
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,050
Come on, it can't be that bad.
别这样，没那么糟吧

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,020
The only thing getting me through...
是非常糟，想到快见到你了 

182
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,160
is knowing I'll see you soon.
我才撑得下去

183
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,590
I might even try to get out of here early.
我搞不好会设法早退 不要…

184
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,660
It sounds like they need you there.
餐厅似乎很需要你

185
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,490
-You're just hanging out with Ross? -It's all good! Okay,bye!
你跟罗斯在一起吗？ 一切都很好，再见

186
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,730
She's gonna kill me.
她会宰了我

187
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,700
The phone was facing the other way.
电话放反了

188
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,910
And that goes back up there.
相框应该摆在上面

189
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,440
This is good. This is under control. We should start with the big stuff.
好，一切都在掌握中 我们从大型砭愀丛起 

191
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,050
That'll be the easiest. Let's start with the couch.
那样比较简单 先搬沙发

192
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,680
I got it.
我没问题

193
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,520
That doesn't look right.
位置好像不对

194
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,890
What are you talking about? The couch is in line with the carpet.
什么意思？ 沙发刚好跟毯子对齐

195
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,400
Then I can just walk over here and casually put my feet up on....
我可以走到这边 轻松的把脚翘在…

196
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,360
Okay, here's what we do.
好

197
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,010
We move the couch closer to the coffee table.
那就把沙发往咖啡桌那边推

198
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,230
But then the back of the couch won't line up with the carpet.
那沙发的背后 就不会跟毯子边缘对齐了

199
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,570
Well,we'll just move the coffee table...
那就把咖啡桌...

200
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,740
closer to the couch.
往沙发那边推

201
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,180
But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
那咖啡桌就不在座位区正中央了

202
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,920
But the coffee table doesn't match the table!
那咖啡桌就…罗斯

203
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,460
Look, what am I gonna do?
我该怎么办？

204
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,160
I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing her to me like a moth to a flame!
我不调情，却还是吸引着她 就像火吸引着飞蛾

205
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,910
What the hell's going on over here?
这里是怎么了？

206
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,940
Monica's gonna kill you!
摩妮卡会宰了你

207
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,770
I need your help.
我需要你们的帮忙 

208
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,610
I have to do something to repel this woman.
我得想办法把这个女人吓跑

209
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,680
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
等等

210
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,750
You guys repel women all the time!
你们最会把女人吓跑了

211
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,950
Hey, I've been married three times.
我可是结过三次婚

212
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,130
No, I've seen it happen.
不，我亲眼见识过

213
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,170
You get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you manage to kill it.
你们跟女人交往得好好的 最后却总是能搞砸

214
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,140
Time after time after time after time.
一次一次又一次

215
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,570
What's your secret?
你们的秘诀是什么？

216
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,340
We do not repel women,okay?
我们并不会把女人吓跑 

217
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,280
That is completely untrue.
完全没有这回事

218
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,110
Oh, yes, we do, my man.
我们确实会

219
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,090
Remember when we went to a dance...
记不记得大学参加春季舞会 

220
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,420
and you walked up to that girl you liked and talked...
你走向看对眼的女生

221
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,130
about the lrish potato famine?
却大谈爱尔兰马铃薯饥荒？

222
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,000
What about you? You weren't so hot either.
那你呢？你当年也没那么酷

223
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,530
After everything he said, he'd go..
他每次说完话都会...

224
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,500
Monica doesn't like that either. I should stop doing that.
摩妮卡也不喜欢 也许我应该改掉

225
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,370
Girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
对了，女生不喜欢我聊科学 

226
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,810
That's not specific to girls.
不只是女生

227
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,680
This is great. What else?
太好了，还有呢？

228
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,710
They don't like you correcting their grammar.
她们不喜欢你纠正她们的文法

229
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,440
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
她们不喜欢你解释 你的笑话哪里好笑

230
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,690
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
她们不喜欢你一直问她们 喜不喜欢你

231
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,470
-Man,I am so lucky I have Monica. -I'm never gonna find love again.
天哪，幸好我有摩妮卡 我再也别想谈恋爱了

232
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,370
-Can I talk to you for a second? -Sure.
菲比，可以跟你谈一谈吗？ 好啊

Phoebe,I just wanted to say I'm sorry,okay?
菲比，我只是想跟你道歉

235
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,710
I handled the situation horribly.
我处理得很差 

236
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,320
And I should not have lied to you.
而且我不该骗你

237
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,220
So what should you have done?
那你应该怎样？

238
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,720
I should have told you the truth.
我应该跟你说实话

239
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,200
Which is?
而实话是…

240
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,600
Well,the reason I didn't want to go running with you is...
我之所以不想跟你跑步 

241
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,400
because...

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,940
the way that you run is just a little....

243

-So? -It's embarrassing.

244

People were looking at us like we were crazy.

245
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,450
-Why do you care? -Because they're people!

People you don't know and will never see again.

I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.

你从来没有往前冲到 腿好像快断了吗？

259
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,570
Like when you were running towards the swings or running away from Satan?

I couldn't say I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.
我不能说我光着身体 她可以看我光着身体
