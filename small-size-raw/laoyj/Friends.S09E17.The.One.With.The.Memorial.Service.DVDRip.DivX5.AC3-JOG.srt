我得打电话给他，只是跟他说说话 应该不会怎样

事情都是那样开始的 我不需要吃蛋糕，我只要闻一闻…

旧哈吉身上有个钮扣不见了，我找不到 有没有关系？

You're not the same.

after I've buzzed you into the building.
因为是我按开楼下的门让你进来的

事实上，我没有必要 因为“罗斯死了”的笑话根本没用

218
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,990
Okay? There were no responses.
好吗？根本就没有人回应

219
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,750
Nobody posted anything, nobody called my parents, so the joke is on you.
没有人张贴任何东西 没有人打电话给我父母，你才好笑

220
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,990
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.

而我死了，却连一个回覆都没有！

226
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,920

嗯，同志社团比死人社团还要活跃

This isn't about people not caring.
不是说大家不在乎

232
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,530
This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
而是那并非适合的抒发悲情的管道

233
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,410

-你说的没错，那不是适合的管道 -没错

Ross, what are you doing?

不，那会太离谱了，你要帮我办

239
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,930
- Ross, don't press send. Don't press.. - No, too late. Too late. It's sent.
-罗斯，不要寄出，不要寄… -不，太迟了，太迟了，寄出了

240
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,340
Sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.
对不起，还有你 跟警察先生的照片也寄了

241
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,970
That's all right. I'm tan, limber..
没关系，我晒的很黑又很健壮

242
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,120
And it looks like I talked my way out of that ticket.
看起来好像是我在求他不要开罚单

243
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,520

244
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,420
"What are we gonna do, Drake?"

245
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,630
Come in.
进来

246
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,270
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap. Have you seen Huggsy?
我刚要哄艾犸睡一下 你有看到哈吉吗？

247
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,410
Original or crappy?

248
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,270
- Original. - No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.

Then what's that big lump under your covers?
那你床上突起来的是什么？

250
