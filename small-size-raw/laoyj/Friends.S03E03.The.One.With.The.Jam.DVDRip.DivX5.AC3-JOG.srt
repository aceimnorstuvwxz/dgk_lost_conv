That's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman.

I am such a dingus!

I just want you to know I wasn't always like this.

54
00:04:47,02 --> 00:04:49,28
It's an empty apartment.

We're all alone in an empty apartment.

56
00:04:53,79 --> 00:04:56,28
I have to be at work in 10 minutes.
我在十分钟内得去上班

57
00:04:57,09 --> 00:05:01,26
All right. It's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
好吧，我又不是模范员工

58
00:05:06,53 --> 00:05:07,69
There it is!
在这里啊！

59
00:05:07,90 --> 00:05:09,89

60
00:05:12,94 --> 00:05:13,96
Do I look fat?

I accept that.

When Janice asked me and I said no, she thought I was calling her a cow.
当珍妮丝问我时，我回答不 她却认为我说她像母牛

64
00:05:24,12 --> 00:05:27,05
Walk us through it,honey. Walk us through it.
重头再说一次给我们听…

65
00:05:27,59 --> 00:05:32,65
Janice said,"Hi. Do I look fat today?" And I looked at her
珍妮丝说，她今天看起来胖吗 我看看她…

You looked at her?

67
00:05:38,63 --> 00:05:39,96
You never look.
你绝不能看

68
00:05:41,10 --> 00:05:45,27
You just answer. It's like a reflex. "Do I look fat?" "No."
你只能回答，就像反射动作 “我看起来胖吗？”，“不”

69
00:05:48,18 --> 00:05:50,67
"Is she prettier than I am?" "No."

71
00:05:53,41 --> 00:05:54,81
And it works both ways.

72
00:05:57,99 --> 00:06:01,11
So you both just know this stuff?
所以你们本来就知道这些？

73
00:06:01,36 --> 00:06:04,69
After 30 or 40 fights, you kind of catch on.
吵了大概三四十次后 你大概就记住了

74
00:06:06,19 --> 00:06:08,03
Okay. For instance:

Janice is coming back from a trip. She gives you two options.

79
00:06:21,28 --> 00:06:23,11
Wrong! Now you're single.
错了，所以你没女朋友啦

80
00:06:25,65 --> 00:06:28,64
It's actually secret option number three.

81
00:06:29,05 --> 00:06:32,35
You meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
你在登机门与她碰面 这就表现出你对她的爱

82
00:06:33,45 --> 00:06:34,82
Okay,this is good.
好，这样真不错

83
00:06:35,02 --> 00:06:38,62
All right,I have one. Janice likes to cuddle...
好，我有一个问题 珍妮丝晚上喜欢抱抱…

84
00:06:38,83 --> 00:06:41,29
...at night, which I'm all for.
我当然也喜欢抱抱

86
00:06:45,67 --> 00:06:48,07
So how do I tell her that without...

87
00:06:48,37 --> 00:06:51,57
...you know,accidentally calling her fat or something?
不小心又说她胖之类的？

88
00:06:52,01 --> 00:06:56,34
Sorry,honey. We can't help you there,because we're cuddly sleepers.
抱歉，我们帮不了你 因为我们都是抱着睡的

I'm late for work.

I thought you were "cuddly sleepers."

95
00:07:20,17 --> 00:07:22,76
No,not cuddly. Not me. Just her.

96
00:07:23,07 --> 00:07:25,10
I'm like you. I need the room.
我跟你一样，我需要空间

97
00:07:25,41 --> 00:07:26,70

我是说，他在跟踪没错 但他以为我是乌苏拉

我算过了 我每罐得卖17元才能打平
