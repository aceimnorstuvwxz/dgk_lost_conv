87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
This is the best thing that could've happened to you.

88
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,680
You've needed to get out on your own.
反正你也得独立

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,920
When I did it, at first I was scared, but then look at me now.

but that doesn't sound like me.

103
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,230
Oh,I like cars.
我喜欢汽车

104
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,970

Okay,here are the tips for this morning.
早上的小费出来了 

107
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,180
Jen gets 50, 50 for me and Joey owes 8 dollars.
珍50，我50 乔伊欠8块钱

109
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,020
-What? -For all the free food you gave away.
-什么？ -因为你到处送吃的

110
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,160
If it's free, how come you're charging me for it?
既然是送的，为什么跟我要钱

111
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,330
We don't give anything away unless it's a birthday.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,030
What if they came in third in a modeling contest?

吉儿，你怎么有钱？ 你爸不是把信用卡都收走了？

117
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,480
I memorized those numbers when I was 15.
拜托，我15岁就会背卡号了

然后把东西秀给吉儿看？

You've never heard of them?

Of course I've heard of them.

-A pashmina? -Yeah!

147
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,350
Really?

148
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,820
What's a pashmina?
帕什米纳是什么？

149
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,760
It's a rug.
一种小毯子

150
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,990
Jill?

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,900
I'm sorry,Rachel.
瑞秋，对不起…

152
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,810
You think that's gonna work on me? I invented that.
拜托，你真以为我会上当？ 泪眼攻势是我发明的

153
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,270
Right! But I am sorry.
也对，但我真的很抱歉

154
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,940
It's okay. One little setback is okay.
算了，走一次回头路还好

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,550
-But don't let it happen again,okay? -Okay.
-就是别再犯了，好吗？ -好。

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,120
Now,since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away.
既然这是老爸付的钱 我应该全都没收

157
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,520
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.
不过我没收披肩就好

158
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,060
And the pants.
还有那条裤子

159
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,570
I'll take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.
还是都没收好了 这样你才能得到教训

160
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,700
All right.

161
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,670
I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.

She took all my stuff.

163
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,810
Yeah. Everything but the little blue one.

That's the best one!

165
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,150
Oh,my God. Thank you so much!
天哪，谢谢你

166
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,220
Well,hey.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,450
Oh,my gosh,that was so lame. Like a pashmina could be a rug.
天哪，你好逊喔 帕什米纳怎么会是小毯子

168
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,360
Oh,yeah? How about you with the "I'm sorry"?
那你呢？“对不起…”

169
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,730
Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.
闭嘴，我哪有那么恶心

我那个公寓裤呢？够蠢吧？

-Were you this cute in high school? -Oh,stop.
-你高中时有这么可爱吗？ -别闹了

-你才别闹了 -你才别闹了

173
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,750
Why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it?
你别闹了 好，我坐中问，你们都别闹了

Okay. So,what do you want to do?
你想做什么？

176
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,690
Let's do something crazy.

177
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,920
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.

不过如果我要上床 你也得跟我来

See,that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all...
我本来很难说不 但是你...

181
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,280
drippy here.

00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,620
Are you saying that you don't want to get with this?
你是说你不想要我吗？

183
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,290
I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.
你最好连健康时都不要这样

184
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,890
Come on.

Don't take this personally.

I just can't have sex with a sick person.
我就是没办法跟病人上床

187
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,170
I'm with you. I can't have sex with a sick person either. Disgusting!

Let me prove it to you.

We are two healthy people in the prime of lime.

I think there's something you should know.

Better not be about the apartment pants.

I was with Ross and Jill after you left...
我刚和罗斯，吉儿在一起

199
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,990
and I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
我很确定他们之间有火花

200
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,030
-What? -I mean,it's probably nothing.

But I wanted to warn you that there might be something.

Oh,my God! I cannot believe that!

不是我反对罗斯交女朋友 但跟我妹？

210
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,750
Isn't that incest or something?

And they're gonna have sex.

Oh,no! What if he marries her too?

This is just terrible. This is just terrible.

214
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,670
And I can't stop it. I don't own Ross.

And Jill should be able to do what she wants to do.
而且吉儿有她的行动自由

我的天哪，罗斯居然要娶我妹妹

That'll be $3.85.

What? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay.
什么意思？ 昨天你还说我太美不该付钱

Sorry I'm late. What's up?

我只是想问你工作找得怎样
