And even if they weren't..

It's just weird what's happening with her and Ross.

当他们一起住时, 我以为事情就解决了

我或许不会有小孩 总是要有人帮我传承香火吧

你知道吗？或许他们一旦开始 跟别人约会，知道别人是怎样的…

they'll realize how good they are for each other.

I had this date last night. Yuck!

但是应该要说小声一点 她还在房间里面

那我们该怎么做呢？ 我们要帮他们介绍人吗？

59
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,130
I know, that just pushes them further and further apart.
我知道，这样只会使他们渐行渐远

60
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,930
I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates..
我知道要怎么做了 我们可以帮罗斯跟瑞秋介绍可怕的人

-为什么？有什么不对吗？ -我以为你跟罗斯是…
