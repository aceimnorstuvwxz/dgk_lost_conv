It's gonna be fine.

How's the packing going?

Ben? He's fine. He's right.. Oh, my God!
班？他很好，他就在…妈呀

293
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,500
Get your head out of your shirt there, son!
把头从衣服里伸出来

294
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,460
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
什么？ 对，是南瓜，我过去帮忙

-What's wrong?  -Ross and I were helping pack...
怎么了？ 罗斯和我帮忙打包

297
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,520
took a little break. I lost $1500 to him in Cups!
在休息时 我跟他玩杯牌输了1千5

298
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,810
How did you lose at Cups?
玩杯牌怎么会输？ 

299
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,690
The same way you lost!
跟你输的方式一样

300
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,420
I started out with the king and the queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.
我先拿到老K和皮蛋 砰！罗斯拿到2和3

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,360
Then I get a jack and a king. Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.
然后我拿到杰克和老K 砰！罗斯拿到4和5

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,770
Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup...
罗斯拿到满杯，D罩杯 

303
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,170
the sitting-down bonus. I didn't even get half a cup! Nothing!
和自动加码 我连半副杯牌都凑不到

305
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,100

He never played before either.

我觉得玩杯牌都靠新手的牌运

308

Let's play one more hand. One more hand.
好，我们再玩一把

No more! I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time.

I wanna give you something.

现在先送 免得我为了赌债拿去当

as a thank-you for being such a great roommate.

我不能收，你很喜欢这个雕像

317
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,580
It's "him." Not "it."
他不是雕像，他是活的

318
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,110
What if I bought it from you?

You're trying to give me money again!

When did I try to give you money?

324
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,600
Over there with the bills!

Now you start with the charity thing again!

You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself.
你不能老觉得我无法照顾自己

332
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,520
I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money.

没有那种牌，那是我捏造的
