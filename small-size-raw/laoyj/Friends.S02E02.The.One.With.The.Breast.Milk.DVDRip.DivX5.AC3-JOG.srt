Here are your keys,honey.

... because she was my brother's girlfriend.

163
00:11:12,23 --> 00:11:14,10
Wait,we only did it once.

It meant nothing to me!

So you just happened to leave it in here?

Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?

I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.

I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
我只是不认为 母乳是给大人喝的

当然母乳的容器 很吸引大人与小孩
