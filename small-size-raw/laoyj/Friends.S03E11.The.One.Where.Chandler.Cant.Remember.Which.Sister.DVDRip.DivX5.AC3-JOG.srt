"Hummina,hummina,hummina."

So he's "just a nice guy."

141
00:09:14,48 --> 00:09:18,25
Do you really think this Mark doesn't want anything for helping you?
你真的认为这个叫马克的 是不求回报地帮你？

Well,I assume I'll have to take showers with him.

... because I drank it.

你去哪里了？你拆了礼物之后 我们就找不到你了

我后来跑到贮藏室 而且不只我一个人

I fooled around with Joey's sister.

Are you insane?

Joey will kill you. He'll actually kill you dead.
乔伊会杀了你 他真的会把你杀得死死的

159
00:10:18,31 --> 00:10:20,41
You don't think I thought of that?

See? You can't tell which is which either!

We didn't fool around with any of them.

When I drink,sometimes I get overly friendly...

这是实话？还是你泡我妹妹 只是为了忘记珍妮丝？
