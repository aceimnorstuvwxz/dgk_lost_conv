我以为我们之间友谊的基础是难堪的发型。

250
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,280
If we're really gonna do this, it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
好吧，你看，要是我们真的明算账的话， 你也不是没干过违反君子协定的事。

I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
我从没跟安卓.特娜搅和到一起。

I don't know what you're talking about.

259
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,040
Really? Remember that party freshman year?
真的？还记得那个入学后第一个圣诞节假期 前一周的晚会吗？

You had some visitors.

College guys are so cute.

不过要是有个象克瑞.哈姆那样的想亲我 我是不会拒绝的。

-Aren't you..? -Yeah, Rachel.

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,980
I'll see if I can find Ross.

千万别让我坐上去，不然我们就走不了了。

284
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,470
Listen, Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
听着，安卓，你可不能告诉钱德。

Well, I did. And it hurt.
但是我知道了，我还很伤心。

290
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,050
That's when I wrote the song "Betrayal in the Common Room."
所以我才写了"在休息室被背叛"那首歌。

291
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,200
That's why that song had so much power.
所以那首歌才那么带劲

292
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,900
Man, I'm sorry.

Look, that was a long time ago.
好了，那都是陈年往事了。

294
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,150
So I made out with Adrienne, and you made out with Missy.
那，我跟安卓亲热，而你跟米西亲热。

还有一件事。 那晚我特生你的气，想报复你
