钱德现在没有在赚钱 三亿对我们可是会很好用的

13

比你被闪电打到四十二次的机率还小

你们知道吗？我确定 你们的愿望会成真

106
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,490
- You're not gonna win. - I know the odds are against us..
-你们不会中的 -我知道机率很小

107
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,820
but somebody has to win, and it could be us. And then how you gonna feel?
但是总是有人会中，可能就是我们 然后你会觉得如何呢？

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,730
We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the Cape."
我们会说“大家开直升机去海角玩吧”
