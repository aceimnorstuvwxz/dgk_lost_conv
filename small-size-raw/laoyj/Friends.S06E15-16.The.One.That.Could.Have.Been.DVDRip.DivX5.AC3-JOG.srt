1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,730
So it seems like this lnternet thing is here to stay,huh?
看来网际网路是不会消失了

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,000
It's okay not to talk.
不说话也没关系

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,500
Hey,you guys,guess what.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,980
No. Barry and Mindy.
不，是贝瑞和明蒂

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,450
Oh,sorry. I hear "divorce," I immediately go to Ross.

Who's Barry and Mindy?
谁是贝瑞和明蒂？

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,020
Barry was the guy that I almost married, and Mindy was my best friend.
贝瑞是我差点要嫁的人 明蒂是我最要好的朋友

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,920
Wasn't he cheating on you with her?
他们不是有一腿？

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,430
But that just means he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
对，但那只表示他做到一半 会在她身上睡着

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,170
-Why did they get divorced? -Well,apparently...

she caught him cheating on her with someone else.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,350
Can you imagine if I'd married him? How different would my life be?

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,240
I've always wondered how different my life would be...
我懂你的意思，我总是在想 

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,320
if I'd never gotten divorced.
要是我没有离婚会怎样

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,450
-Which time? -The first time!
哪一次？ 第一次啦

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,680
Imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
真的，要是卡萝没发现 她是同性恋

21
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,290
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
我无法想像 我老是往好的方面去想

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,400
I bet I'd still be doing my karate.
那我一定还在练控手道 （空手道）

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,810
Towards the end of our marriage, I did a lot of karate to release the tension...
后来我经常练控手道

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,140
from not doing anything else physical.
好发泄缺乏肉体运动的精力

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,840
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."
也许你不念成控手道就没事了

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,080
What if I was still fat?
如果我还是很胖呢？

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,810
You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.

-Sure I would. -Come on.

You guys really think I'm that shallow?

No,I just think Monica was that fat.
不，我只是觉得摩妮卡太胖

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,890
Hey,imagine if I'd never got fired off Days of Our Lives.
要是我没被 “我们的岁月”开除呢？

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,370
Hey. Hey,there's Carol again.
卡萝又出现了

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,670
What if I had had the guts to quit my job?
要是我有勇气辞职呢？

35
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,780
I'd probably be writing for The New Yorker, being paid to be funny.
我可能在帮“纽约客”写稿 拿钱搞笑

36
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,020
But my job's fun too. I mean,tomorrow...

I don't have to wear a tie.

38
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,680
What if I'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch?

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,790
-What? -Merrill Lynch?
什么？ 美林证券？

40
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,360
I had a massage client who worked there, and he said I had a knack for stocks.
对，我有个客人在那里上班 他说我有炒股票的头脑

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,860
Why didn't you take the job?
那你怎么不去？

43
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,590
Because at that time,I thought that everything that rhymed was true.
因为当时我很相信押韵这回事

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,790
I thought if I worked with stocks...
我觉得要是我去做股票 

45
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,470
I'd have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
就得住地窖 只能吃安眠药，养三脚猫

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,370
Yeah,you don't want that in a broker.
这种股票经纪人的确不优

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,780
Do you guys think if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
你们觉得如果有这些事 我们还会在一起吗？

48
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,990

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,160
-And she gave me.. -The ring from the cave.
给了我… 石洞里的戒指 记得

575
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,696
好…

576
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,870
Oh,my God! They let you keep that stuff?
天哪，你可以留着它？

577
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,840
Sure. As long as they don't find out, you can keep whatever you want.

578
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,380
And I want you to have it.

Every time you look at it...

I want you to remember that you are a good person.

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,560
But you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
但是你没有 这就是这枚戒指的意义

585
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,560
But I thought that ring stood for Capri's undying love for her brother.
我以为它是代表 卡普丽丝对哥哥永不止息的爱
