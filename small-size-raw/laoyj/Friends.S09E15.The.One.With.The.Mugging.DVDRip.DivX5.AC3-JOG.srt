What's wrong?

我需要想出该怎么卖 而我办不到

148
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,710
because no self-respecting adult would ever wear these.
因为有自尊的成人不会穿这种东西的

它们底部有轮子突出来 让你可以滑来滑去

154
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,480
because apparently walking is too much exercise.
因为很显然，走路太耗费体力了

不好意思，除了我们六个人之外 我还是有其他朋友的

I have a confession to make.

你记得那个在你小时候 抢劫过你的女生吗？

你在说什么呢？那不是女生 是个高壮的男生

He had a pitchfork and a sword.

You don't think I would have defended myself against a 14-year-old..?
你认为我不会反抗 一个十四岁女生吗？

但是如果你仔细想想，这倒是有点酷

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,130

我是说，我常常觉得我像是个局外人

- Even more humiliating than.. - Let's not do this!
-甚至比… -我们不要说了！

264
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,060
And then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hot tub..

Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes.

272
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,990
Maybe he falls. Maybe he hurts himself.
或许他跌倒了，或者受伤了

Or, man who's two years younger than me.
或是，比我小两岁的人

-你是怎么想出来的呢？ -我不知道！我不知道！
