00:10:42,14 --> 00:10:45,23
I wanna be buried at sea. It looks like fun.
我要海葬,好像挺有意思的

145

Define "fun. "

Come on. You'll make a day of it. You'll get a boat,pack a lunch....
那一天你们会玩得很开心的 你们会乘着船带着午餐…

然后把你的尸体丢人大海 真是有意思

148
00:10:58,05 --> 00:11:02,99
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says I'm so predictable.
每个人都自认为了解我 他们都说杰克太一成不变了

149
00:11:03,22 --> 00:11:07,96
Maybe after I'm gone,they'll say, " Buried at sea? Huh? "
或许我死后他们会说 海葬,哈?

150
00:11:11,30 --> 00:11:13,43
That's probably what they'll say.
他们大概会这么说吧

151
00:11:13,93 --> 00:11:15,56
I'd like that.

Look,l' m sorry about yesterday.

So,what do you think it is about me?

I don't know what.
我说不上来

158
00:11:48,34 --> 00:11:50,24

真可惜，因为你和罗尔本来很登对

00:12:05,89 --> 00:12:07,91
He's no Brian in Payroll.
他不像布莱恩

165
00:12:10,93 --> 00:12:11,98
Is Brian?

Brian's a little out of your league.

Excuse me. You don't think I could get a Brian?

Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me.

I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.

Some things are better left unsaid.
