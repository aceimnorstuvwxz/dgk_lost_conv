3
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:21,022
Charlie?

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,034
和我一块儿去散步怎样?
How about you and I go for a walk?

5
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,065
不
No.

6
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:30,051
不  不去  Locke  今天我哪儿都不想去
No thanks, Locke.I'm gonna stay in today.

7
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:31,021
来吧
Come on.

8
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,034
新鲜空气对你有好处
Fresh air will do you good.

9
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:35,034
我的照片要比这好看多了
I take better pictures than that.

10
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:48,097
而且  如果你想放皮夹里的话 这张显然太小了
Smaller too, if you want something for your wallet.

11
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:52,071
我过来取些东西  这...
I just came by for a few things and this was...

12
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:55,068
这照片和我的东西放一块了
This was with my stuff.

13
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:00,060
就是说  你不会留下了?
So you're not staying?

14
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:01,091
你可以说我脱离集体
Call me a broken record,

15
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:04,025
但山洞是一个天然的屏障
but caves are natural shelter.

16
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,076
呆在那儿比呆在海边要安全多了
And a hell of a lot safer than living on the beach.

17
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:08,098
你在生我的气
You're mad at me.

18
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:11,017
没有  Kate  我...
No.Kate, I'm...

19
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:16,095
我只是搞不懂你为什么不和我...我们一块儿过去
I just don't understand why you won't come with me...us.

20
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,006
过去住的话  也就一英里的路
It's maybe a mile up there, if that.

21
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:20,052
我们出事已有8天了  Jack
We crashed eight days ago, Jack.

22
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,032
-我不是要在这儿安家  -我也想离开这岛
-I'm not setting up house here.  -I want off this island, too,

23
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:24,061
但我们都清楚 短期内是不可能离开的
but we both know that's not gonna happen anytime soon.

24
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,078
Sayid有个计划
Sayid has a plan.

25
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:27,089
我知道 寻找求救码的信号发源处  是吧
Yeah, to find the source of the distress code. I know.

26
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:29,060
那信号来自岛屿的某个地方
That signal's coming from somewhere on the island.

27
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:33,012
那信号已重复循环了16年了  Kate
The signal has been running on a loop for 16 years, Kate.

28
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:36,020
但那个发求救信号的女子 并没有被解救
And the woman that left it, she wasn't rescued.

29
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,055
你凭什么认为一定 会有人来救我们?
What makes you think it's gonna be any different for us?

30
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:39,080
我相信
I believe it.

31
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:42,068
我很想自己能分享你的信仰
I wish I shared your faith.

32
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:44,058
我不介意和她分享一些东西
I wouldn't mind sharing a few things with her myself.

33
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:48,004
你想要什么  Sawyer?
What do you want, Sawyer?

34
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:49,095
听说医生要来这儿占位置
Heard the doc here is vacating the premises.

35
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:52,094
我想我最好抢在别人前面 把这地方占了
Thought I best lay claimsv to my new digs before somebody else did.

36
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:56,067
我会把这儿弄的舒舒服服的
I can fix this place up real good.

37
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,012
我甚至发现有人要和我一块儿分享
I might even find somebody to share it with me.

38
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,021
以后再聊吧
I'll talk to you later.

39
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,034
是你吗?
Is that you?

40
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,060
保佑我  神父  因为我的过失
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

41
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:46,057
距上一次忏悔有1个礼拜了
It's been a week since my last confession.

42
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:48,094
继续  我的孩子
Go ahead, my son.

43
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:51,047
昨晚  我...
Last night I had...

44
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:56,095
我和一个不相识的女子发生了关系
physical relations with a girl I didn't even know.

45
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,074
我明白  还有呢?
I see. Anything else?

46
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:05,002
这过后我又...
Yeah. Uh, right after that, I had...

47
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:10,040
我又和另一女子发生了关系
relations with another girl.

48
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:16,068
完事以后  我又看她们俩...
Then straight after that, I watched while they had...

49
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:20,085
看她们发生那种关系
relations with each other.

50
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,054
你知道  这是我的乐队  神父..."驱轴乐队"
You see, it's my band, father...Driveshaft.

51
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:31,023
当时我们在曼彻斯特表演  
We've been playing the clubs in Manchester, and, uh...

52
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,087
大家都玩得很兴奋
we've been getting some heat,

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,059
随后  你知道 
a following, you know, and...

54
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:40,045
那些女子...
the girls...

55
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:45,052
她们来到我们的地方  你知道 真的是很诱惑人
there's some real temptations that come with the territory,

56
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,082
如果你知道我在说什么的话
if you know what I mean.

57
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,002
生活中我们会碰到很多的诱惑
Well, we all have our temptations,

58
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:54,047
但屈服于诱惑 那只是你的选择
but giving into them --that's your choice.

59
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:56,030
我们活在这世上
As we live our lives,

60
00:03:56,061 --> 00:04:00,021
生活就是要你作出选择  难道不是吗?
it's really nothing but a series of choices, isn't it?

61
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:03,039
我已经作好了我的选择
Well, then I've made my choice.

62
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,013
我要离开乐队
I have to quit the band.

63
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,056
谦恭将降临这个地球
And the meek shall inherit the earth.

64
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:29,048
Liam  你在干什么?  这是教堂  把腿放下来
Liam. What are you doing? This is a church. Get your boots off.

65
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,006
不要急  唱诗班的小家伙
Relax, choirboy.

66
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:33,052
我给你带来了另人振奋的好消息
I bring good tidings of great joy.

67
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:36,039
我们刚刚签约了
We've just been signed.

68
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:38,056
一个出唱片的合同
A recording contract.

69
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,051
你会成为摇滚之神的
You're gonna be a rock god.

70
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:02,052
干的好  Charlie
Nice work, Charlie.

71
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,001
你真是个好诱饵
You make excellent bait.

72
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:10,030
很高兴我帮得上忙
I'm glad I could oblige.

73
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,065
现在把毒品还我
Now give me my bloody drugs.

74
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,069
你听到我说的话了么?
Did you hear what I said?

75
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,075
我要你把毒品还我
I want my drugs back.

76
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,007
我需要毒品!
I need them!

77
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:45,047
但是是你自己给我的
Yet you gave them to me.

78
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:48,012
我真他妈后悔给了你!
And I bloody well regret it!

79
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:49,043
我病了  老兄!
I'm sick, man!

80
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,059
你看不出来吗?!
Can't you see that?

81
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,076
你比你想象的要坚强得多  Charlie
I think you're a lot stronger than you know, Charlie.

82
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:54,091
这我会证明给你看
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

83
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:57,049
我允许你三次向我要毒品
I'll let you ask me for your drugs three times.

84
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,072
第三次的时候  我会把毒品给你
The third time, I'm gonna give them to you.

85
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:02,043
现在明白了吧  这算是第一次
Now, just so we're clear, this is one.

86
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:06,057
为什么?为什么?你为什么要这么做?
Why? Why? Why are you doing this?

87
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,064
折磨我?
To torture me?

88
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,089
你还是放弃吧  尽快把毒品给我
ust get rid of them and have done with it.

89
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:11,092
如果我这么做了 那你连个选择都没有了  Charlie
If I did that, you wouldn't have a choice, Charlie.

90
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:15,009
而且比起本能 作出选择或决定
And having choices, making decisions based on more than instinct

91
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:18,030
是唯一能够把你和它区别开来的
is the only thing that separates you from him.

92
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:25,017
三根天线
Three antennae.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,057
作为三角形的三个点
Three points of a triangle.

94
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,045
一根插在海边
One here on the beach.

95
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:33,024
另一根  Kate将把它插在 丛林内部大约2公里处
Another Kate will position in the jungle roughly 2 kilometers in.

96
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:37,080
第三根  我会带到高地去--就那儿
And the third, I'll take to high ground --up there.

97
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,003
如果那法国信号
If the french transmission

98
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,058
是来自这三角范围的某个地方
is coming from somewhere within our triangulation,

99
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:44,063
我就能定位这个信号发射地
I'll be able to locate the source.

100
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,041
但还是有两个难点
But there are two complications.

101
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:47,060
那是肯定的
Of course there are.

102
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:51,050
我安置在天线内的电量不多
The power cells I crafted onto the antennas are dry.

103
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:53,083
我也不知道能维持多久
There's no telling how long they'll last.

104
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:56,076
一分钟  或许要多  或许要少
A minute, maybe more, maybe less.

105
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,090
所以只有大家都就位了 才能启动天线装置!
So we have to wait until we're in position before we switch them on?

106
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:03,043
我们怎么知道对方都已经就位了?
How are we gonna be able to tell that we're actually in the right position?

107
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,090
我们相互之间没办法联系
We have no way to communicate with each other.

108
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,057
炮筒?
Bottle rockets?

109
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:11,022
感谢上帝允许烟火的走私
Thank god for fireworks smugglers.

110
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,006
听着 当我就位以后  我会发射炮筒
Now, when I'm in position, I'll fire off my rocket.

111
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:17,028
你俩看见以后  同时发射你们的
When you two see it, you fire yours.

112
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,068
最后一个炮筒一升天
As soon as the last one has gone up,

113
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,080
我们就迅速启动天线装置
we'll all switch on our antennas.

114
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,084
好的  但你说有两个难处
Okay, but you said that there are two complications.

115
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:25,079
接收机是没电的
The battery in the transceiver is dead.

116
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,038
没有接收机  这一切都将是白忙活
Without the transceiver, all of this is for nothing.

117
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,055
笔记本中的有些部件可能会有用
Something from a laptop computer would probably work,

118
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,070
但我找不到
but I've not been able to find anything.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,049
我想我知道去哪儿找
I think I might know where to look.

120
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,060
自从坠机后  你就像美洲大鼠 一样会藏东西
You've been hoarding like a pack rat since the crash,

121
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:41,034
却连一台笔记本都没有?
and you don't have a single laptop?

122
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:43,026
我们都是易怒的
We are testy.

123
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:45,024
还在因分手烦恼?
Still upset about your little breakup?

124
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,066
你和Jacko?
You and Jacko?

125
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:47,094
一定很累
Must be exhausting.

126
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,005
你说什么?
What's that?

127
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,087
像寄生虫一样活着
Living like a parasite.

128
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,020
只入不出
Always taking, never giving.

129
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,019
你要我去干活  是吧?
Boy, you've got me pegged, don't you?

130
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,032
我明白了
I get it now.

131
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,052
你不想离开这个岛 是因为回去也没什么好留恋的
You don't want off this island because there's nothing for you to go back for.

132
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,011
没有你思念的人
Nobody you miss.

133
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:03,082
也没人思念你
And no one misses you.

134
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:06,098
你是不是同情我了?
Oh, are you feeling sorry for me?

135
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,010
我没同情你
I don't feel sorry for you.

136
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,077
我可怜你
I pity you.

137
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,037
你所要做的就是说声"请"
All you had to do was say "please."

138
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,082
伙计  这里面什么东西  煤块吗?
Dude, what's in these things, cinder blocks?

139
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,086
我把我认为会用到的东西都带来了 以备不时之需
I packed everything I thought might be useful here without leaving the others shorthanded.

140
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:40,004
要帮忙吗?
Hey, do you guys need a hand?

141
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,033
以前在乐队有专门托运人员之前 都是我们自己拉装备的
I used to lug the band's equipment before we had roadies, way back in the day.

142
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:47,063
-让我... -不  Charlie  拉链是...
-Here, let me ---No, Charlie, the zipper's...

143
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,030
抱歉  我想帮忙的
Sorry. I was just trying to help.

144
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:55,058
我知道  没关系
I know. It's okay.

145
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:58,066
嘿  帮我把剩下的包裹搬来好吗?
Hey, want to help me grab the rest of those bags?

146
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,033
我行的吗?
Could I?

147
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:19,051
...有点头疼
... have a headache.

148
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:24,028
镇定安眠药
Diazepam.

149
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,031
那是治疗焦虑的
It's for anxiety.

150
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:30,088
-我在找阿斯匹林  -对头疼来说  这种药效很强
-I was looking for aspirin.  -Pretty strong stuff for a headache.

151
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:32,095
是的
Yeah, right.

152
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,062
你没事吧?你看起来有点...
Hey, you okay? You're looking a little...

153
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:37,082
我  不  我没事 就是有点头疼
I...no, it's nothing. It's just a headache.

154
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,020
Charlie  随它去吧 去取些水 你可能是脱水了
Charlie, leave it. Go get some water. Maybe you're dehydrated.

155
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:44,079
Charlie  我来就行了
Charlie, I got it.

156
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:47,081
你先照顾好自己
Go take care of yourself, man.

157
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:50,025
我暂时不需要你的帮忙
I don't need youright now.

158
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:09,020
拜托  Charlie  没有你我们做不成
Come on, Charlie boy, we can't do this without you.

159
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,054
你才是他妈的"驱轴灵魂"
You are bloody Driveshaft.

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,016
注意语言
Watch the language.

161
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,098
现在是我们出风头的大好时机
This is our shot at the big time.

162
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:20,006
什么?  难道你不想成名?
What? You don't want to be famous?

163
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:22,059
我不是为了那个  我只关心我的音乐
It's not about all that. I only care about the music.

164
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:25,021
是的  你的音乐  是你的歌让我们签的约
Yeah, your music. Your songs that got us signed.

165
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,036
我只是一个有着漂亮脸蛋 唱着你的歌的小丑
I'm just a clown with a pretty face that sings them.

166
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:29,037
你想把机会让给别人?
And you want to take away my chance to be somebody?

167
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,024
Liam  这不是你的缘故
Liam, it's not about you.

168
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:32,059
这是...
It's...

169
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:34,057
我爱这只乐队
I love the band.

170
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,044
但这不是真正的我
It's not who I am.

171
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,045
有时  我总感觉有点迷失
Sometimes I just get lost in it.

172
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:43,027
不会再那样了  因为我会一如既往的照顾你
Won't happen, 'cause I'll be there looking out for you.

173
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,086
我们大家都相互照顾 那不是兄弟间应该做的事吗?
We'll look outfor each other...what brothers do, right?

174
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,016
对吧?
Right?

175
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,059
等! 等! 等! 等...
Wait, wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

176
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:52,016
答应我一件事
Just promise me one thing.

177
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,009
如果事情变得太过疯狂
If things get too crazy,

178
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:56,032
不管怎样
no matter what,

179
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:57,071
如果我说我们就此结束
if I say we're done,

180
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,092
我们立马走人
we walk away.

181
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,005
我们立马走人
We walk away.

182
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:04,050
Liam  你得承诺
Liam, promise.

183
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:07,076
我们立马走人
We walk away.

184
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:10,082
小兄弟  你是摇滚之神
You're the rock god, baby brother.

185
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:16,036
坏家伙!
Aah! Wanker!

186
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:30,078
你应该让医生检查一下你的手腕

187
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,010
没事  会好的

188
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,030
看你怎么穿的?

189
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:40,011
太不雅观了

190
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:42,022
多穿点

191
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:46,000
太热了

192
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:54,020
伙计  这是你的?
Hey, dude, this yours?

193
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,059
是的
Oh, yeah.

194
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,072
你一定有疑问  因为我是驱轴乐队的贝斯手
Probably wondering because I play bass in Driveshaft.

195
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,025
我还写了很多的曲子
I wrote a bunch of tunes on that.

196
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:05,010
听着  伙计  Jack要你把吉他放在其它地方
Listen, man, Jack just wants you to find another placefor it.

197
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,013
他有东西要搬来  马上就到了
He's moving supplies and says it's in the way.

198
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,048
你知道  有多少人崇拜我吗!
You know, a lot of people look up to me.

199
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:17,089
他们尊重我
They respect me.

200
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:20,075
而你...却把我当成他妈的小孩子
And you...you just treat me like I'm some bloody child,

201
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,014
好像我是个无用的笑话
like I'm some useless joke.

202
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:23,002
你在说什么呀?
What are you talking about?

203
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,028
"Charlie做不好这个"
"Charlie's not good enough to do this,"

204
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,033
"Charlie挡着路了"
"Charlie's just in the way."

205
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,073
坐下  让我看看你
Sit down. Let me take a look at you.

206
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:28,016
你要照顾我是吧?
Oh, you're gonna look out for me, yeah?

207
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:29,063
我们是相互照顾的  事情就是这样
We'll look out for each other. That's how it is.

208
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,019
Charlie  冷静  好吗? 你失控了
Charlie, just calm down, all right? You're not yourself right now.

209
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,081
你不了解我  我是他妈的摇滚之神!
You don't know me. I'm a bloody rock god!

210
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,020
不
Oh, no.

211
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:58,020
Charlie  Jack在哪?
Charlie, where's Jack?

212
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,086
Jack在哪?
Where's Jack?

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,098
Jack! Jack  能听到我说话吗?!
Jack! Jack, can you hear me?!

214
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:21,053
我们刚在聊天  石头就这么下来了 一切都太突然了
We were just talking, and it came down on us. It all happened so fast.

215
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:22,067
我们需要帮助
Dude, we gotta get help.

216
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:24,094
Charlie  你去海边叫些人手过来!
Charlie, go down to the beach and get help!

217
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:26,000
好  我这就去
Okay, I'm on it.

218
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,029
别忘了告诉Kate!
And make sure you tell Kate!

219
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:32,040
我们要怎么做...
What we're doing...

220
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:35,044
追踪一些虚幻的求救信号
chasing some phantom distress signal...

221
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,063
如果行了  那真是太神奇了
what are the odds of this working?

222
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,078
和我们能够在 飞机失事中存活一样神奇
No worse than the odds of our surviving that plane crash.

223
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:43,051
一直以来都有人在飞机失事中存活的
People survive plane crashes all the time

224
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,071
但这次不一样
Not like this one.

225
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:48,005
在我们还在空中的时候 尾舱就已经折断了
The tail section broke off when we were still in the air.

226
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:49,097
我们这部分舱像翻跟斗一样 跌进了丛林里
Our section cartwheeled through the jungle,

227
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,066
除了一些刮伤  我们成功的活了下来
and yet we escaped with nothing but a few scrapes.

228
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:54,012
这又如何解释?
How do you explain that?

229
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:56,039
中大运了
Blind dumb luck.

230
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,092
没人会这么幸运的
No one's that lucky.

231
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,066
本来我们已经死了
We shouldn't have survived.

232
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,077
抱歉  Sayid
Sorry, Sayid,

233
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,042
但事情就这么发生了
but some things just happen...

234
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,024
没有规律  也没有原因
no rhyme, no reason.

235
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,051
我们需要帮忙!
Hey! We need help!

236
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:13,087
-怎么了?  -是Jack  他出事了
-What's wrong, man?  -It's Jack. He's trapped.

237
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,042
什么?
What?

238
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:16,013
山洞倒塌了 我们甚至不知道他是否还活着
A cave collapsed. We don't even know if he's alive.

239
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,071
-快  我们得走了  -Scott?
-Come on, we got to go.  -Hey, uh, Scott?

240
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:18,077
-我是Steve  -我是Scott
-I'm Steve.  -I'm Scott.

241
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:21,018
事情很紧急  叫些人走吧..
We got an emergency. Grab a couple guys and let's go.

242
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:22,004
我们得走了
We got to go now.

243
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:24,070
 快  我们得走了
Hey, come on. Let's go.

244
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:29,051
Shannon  你得准备好做一件 很重要的事  好吗?
Shannon, you have to be ready to do something really important, okay?

245
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:30,090
5:00点
5:00 sharp.

246
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,094
你得准备好启动那个天线装置
You need to be ready to turn that antenna on over there.

247
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,056
底部有个开关
There's a switch at the base.

248
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:36,027
为什么?
Why?

249
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,032
因为Kate和Sayid正在三角定位 那个求救信号
Because Kate and Sayid are triangulating the french signal.

250
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,012
但天线的电力很弱
But the antenna's power is really weak,

251
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:44,005
所以你得等着  直到他们把炮筒发射上天
so you have to wait until they fire their bottle rockets.

252
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:45,048
然后你也点燃炮筒
Then you fire this one,

253
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:47,095
接着就启动天线装置  明白了吗?
then you turn on the antenna. Got it?

254
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,081
开关在哪?
Switch is where now?

255
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:53,083
你听到我说什么了吗  你到底是能还是不能?
Did you hear a word I said? Can you or can't you do it?

256
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,001
-当然我能  -好  好的
-Yeah, I can.  -Okay. Okay.

257
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:01,054
等等  Kate
Wait. Kate.

258
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:03,050
我们得把Jack这事告诉Kate
Hey, we have to tell Kate about Jack!

259
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,029
抱歉  爱跑腿的  你错过了
Sorry, sport. Just missed her.

260
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,085
她和"穆罕默德"大约10分钟前去树林了
Her and Muhammed headed into the woods about 10 minutes ago.

261
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:08,063
哪边走的?
Which way?

262
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,032
不要焦虑了 朋友  我知道他们往哪边走的
Don't sweat it, amigo. I know which way they went.

263
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,063
-是的  但...  -我会告诉她的
-Yeah, but...  -I'll tell her.

264
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,023
你尽管做...随便你做什么...
You just keep doing...whatever it is you do around here.

265
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:05,039
好
All right.

266
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,076
好  好的
All right, all right.

267
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,082
感谢你出来
Hey, mate. Thanks for coming out.

268
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,020
Liam!

269
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,058
你怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

270
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,062
又一场精彩的表演 你光彩四射
Another kick-ass show. You were bloody brilliant.

271
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,071
那句合唱词"you all,everybody."应该是我领的
I sing the chorus to "you all, everybody."

272
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,086
是的抱歉
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

273
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,085
感觉那时我特兴奋 而且观众都想这样
It's like I got caught up in the moment, like the crowd wanted it.

274
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,077
是我知道 但如果我先开始  你随后...
Yeah, I know, but if I start, and then you come in after...

275
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:31,005
她可以! 让她进来!
She's cool! Let her in!

276
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,065
我发誓这不会再发生了
Won't happen again. I promise.

277
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:36,036
Allo  亲爱的
Allo, lovely.

278
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:49,087
放松点儿  小兄弟
Chill, baby brother.

279
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:06,055
等等!等等  Jack在里面
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait, Jack's in there.

280
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:10,014
移动之前先让我检查一下 万一这不稳...
Letme check it out before youstart moving things around. If it's unstable...

281
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,038
-哦  你怎么知道...  -8年的建筑工作
-Well, how do you know...  -Eight yearsof construction work.

282
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,062
Walt  退后  不要靠近岩石  行不?
Walt, get back, man. I don't want younear the rocks, okay?

283
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,080
还有看好你的狗
And take the dog with you.

284
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:17,001
你们应该去找Locke先生
You guys should get mr. Locke.

285
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,009
Locke在丛林里抓掠物 谁知道他现在在哪?
Locke's out in the jungle killing stuff. Who knows where he is?

286
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:27,065
好  听着  这地方十分不稳
All right, look, this area here is load-bearing.

287
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:31,019
我们得在一个稳固的 没有危险的墙壁处挖
We got to dig where there's no danger of the wall buckling in on itself.

288
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,064
好  就这儿  我们在这儿挖 这儿的墙不会塌下来
All right, here. We dig in here so the wall doesn't collapse.

289
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,002
每次四个人  用手挖 除非能找到铲子
Four at a time, by hand till we can find some kind of shovel.

290
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,051
我们轮流挖  慢慢挖
We take shifts and go slow.

291
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:47,011
没有挖的人就清理挖出来的岩石
Whoever isn't digging should be clearing the rocks that we pull out

292
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,071
还有给干活的人递水  行吗?
and bringing water to who is working, okay?

293
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,045
行动  来吧
Let's move. Come on.

294
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:00,039
你来这儿干什么?
What the hell are you doing here?

295
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:03,087
我只是来告诉你一些事
I just came to tell you you were right about me.

296
00:18:03,097 --> 00:18:06,055
你凭什么认为 我会对你要告诉我的事感兴趣?
What makes you think I'm interested in anything you have to say?

297
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,089
我只是来告诉你  你说得很对
I just came to tell you you were right about me.

298
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,089
除了自己  我不会帮助别人
That I don't help anyone but myself.

299
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,047
我来了  准备投入工作
Well, here I am, ready to pitch in.

300
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:26,072
你来这儿帮忙?
You're here to help?

301
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,056
你的表现让我惊讶  这让我很不舒服
You act any more surprised, I'm gonna get offended.

302
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,091
出事了?Charlie?
Something wrong, Charlie?

303
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:49,005
是的
Yeah.

304
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:50,033
Jack

305
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,010
他  
He's, uh...

306
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,053
山洞发生了意外
there's been an accident at the caves.

307
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,059
Jack被困在洞里了
Jack's trapped in a cave-in.

308
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:01,013
有人在想法子弄他出来吗?
Is anyone trying to get him out?

309
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:03,065
有  那儿有一大堆人
Yeah, there's a bunch of people there now.

310
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,023
你为什么不和他们呆在一块儿?
And why aren't you with them?

311
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,082
你来不只是想告诉我Jack的事  是吧?
You didn't come here to tell me about Jack, did you?

312
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,032
我想要回我的东西  Locke
I want my stash, Locke.

313
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:27,011
我受不了了
I can't stand feeling like this.

314
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,014
过来  我给你看样东西
Come here. I'm gonna show you something.

315
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:42,081
你认为茧里面是什么东西  Charlie?
What do you suppose is in that cocoon, Charlie?

316
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:46,077
我不知道  蝴蝶吗?
I don't know, a butterfly, I guess.

317
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:50,015
不是  比蝴蝶漂亮多了 这是一个蛾的茧
No, it's much more beautiful than that. That's a moth cocoon.

318
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,051
很讽刺是吧!蝴蝶很引人注目  但蛾 --它们吐丝
It's ironic. Butterflies get all the attention, but moths --they spin silk.

319
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:57,064
它们更快更强壮
They're stronger, they're faster.

320
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:01,005
-太奇妙了  但...  -你看到这小洞了?
-That's wonderful, but...  -You see this little hole?

321
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,076
这蛾快破茧了
This moth's just about to emerge.

322
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:06,064
它现在在里面挣扎着
It's in there right now, struggling.

323
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:09,074
慢慢地挖出一条道 穿破厚厚的保护层
It'sdigging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon.

324
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,025
现在  我可以帮它
Now,I could help it

325
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:15,013
用这把刀子
take my knife,

326
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:19,025
轻轻的划出一道口子  蛾就自由了
gently widen the opening, and the moth would be free.

327
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,095
但它太弱了  以致于根本活不下来
But it would be too weak to survive.

328
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:26,034
挣扎是变得强大的自然方法
Struggle is nature's way of strengthening.

329
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,071
现在  这是你第二次向我要回毒品
Now, this is the second time you've asked me for your drugs back.

330
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:36,009
再问我要一次  这就是你的了
Ask me again, and it's yours.

331
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,064
通了!有个洞了!
We're through! We got a hole!

332
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:04,002
Jack! Jack!  能听到我说话吗?  Jack?
Jack! Jack, can you hear me, Jack?

333
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:10,005
拜托  伙计  回答我呀
Come on, dude, answer me

334
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:16,032
我听到他了!他还活着!
I hear him! He's alive!

335
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,043
Jack老兄  你没事吧?
Jack, bro, you okay?

336
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,024
我被夹住了  动不了了
I'm pinned. I can't move.

337
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:29,009
我移动不了!
I can't move!

338
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,087
我们怎么办?
What do we do?

339
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:33,098
怎么把他弄出来?
How do we get him out?

340
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,040
Charlie和我在一起的!
Charlie was with me!

341
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,041
-他没事  他出来了  -听着  Jack?
-He's okay. He made it out.  -Hey, listen, Jack?

342
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:46,001
我们会把你弄出来的
We're gonna get you outta there, okay?

343
00:21:58,072 --> 00:22:00,079
第二根天线就安置在这吧
We'll place the second antenna here.

344
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,073
想帮忙?
You want to help?

345
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,071
把这根天线安装在那边的树上 越高越好
Attach this antenna up in that tree as high up as you can.

346
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,055
哦  谢了 头
Golly, thanks, boss.

347
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,001
5:00点
5:00.

348
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:22,092
看着我的信号灯 然后就轮到你发射
Watch for my flare. Then it's your turn.

349
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:25,009
我不信任他
I don't trust him.

350
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,014
谁会呢?
Who does?

351
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,003
我不放心你和他在一起
I don't trust him with you.

352
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:34,025
我会处理好他的
I can handle him.

353
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:46,025
我们不能把洞弄得再大了 太危险了
Okay, we can't safely make that tunnel any bigger,

354
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,019
但Jack还是出不来
but since Jack can't get out,

355
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:50,046
我们当中必须有人进去 帮他移开乱石
one of us is gonna have to go in and unpin him.

356
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,080
什么  爬进去吗?
What, crawl through that?

357
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:53,013
我想他的意思是小点个子的
I think he means someone smaller.

358
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:57,084
-伙计  我们听不懂中国话  -是韩语  老兄
-Dude, we don't understand chinese.  -Korean, man.

359
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,014
他们是韩国人
They're korean.

360
00:23:01,022 --> 00:23:04,086
-我来吧  -Charlie?
-I'll do it.  -Charlie?

361
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,014
不  听着  你还没恢复过来 或许我可以爬进去
No, man, look, you're still too shook up. I might be able to squeeze

362
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,049
等等  如果发生什么事 谁来照顾你的孩子?
Wait. Who's gonna take care of your son if something happens?

363
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:18,027
她有丈夫 而他有个妹妹
She's got a husband. He's got a sister.

364
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,011
这儿只有我是单身的
I'm alone here.

365
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,067
找不出其他人了
No one on the island.

366
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:26,058
我来做吧
Let me do this.

367
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,086
还不到5:00点 好象你是最后一次看手表似的
Still ain't 5:00, just like the last time you checked your watch.

368
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,094
我只是不想错过Sayid的信号
I just don't want to miss Sayid's signal.

369
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:44,091
记住  我来点火  你启动天线装置
Remember, I'll fire the flare. You set off the antenna.

370
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,097
真该感谢上帝 有你这么个老提醒我的家伙
I just thank the good lord I got you here to keep reminding me.

371
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:50,084
这活并不好干 但总得有人来做
It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it.

372
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:56,004
那家伙哪儿吸引你了?
So what is it about that guy?

373
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,058
Jack?

374
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,033
他什么地方让你...
What is it about him that makes you all...

375
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:04,068
抵不住腰部的诱惑?
weak in the loins?

376
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:07,052
你想做猪  还是天生就这样?
You try to be a pig, or it just come naturally?

377
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:11,006
他是个医生  对吧?
So he's a doctor, right?

378
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:14,019
是的  女士喜欢医生
Yeah, ladies dig the doctors.

379
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:16,045
给我一卷绷带
Hell, give me a couple of band-aids,

380
00:24:16,052 --> 00:24:18,093
一瓶过氧化氢 我也能做个领导者
a bottle of peroxide, I could run this island, too.

381
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:22,014
你在把你和Jack作比较?
You're actually comparing yourself to Jack?

382
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:27,049
我们间并没有很大的区别  宝贝
Difference between us ain't that big, sweetheart.

383
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:32,006
我敢说  要是他能够再多活几周的话
I guarantee you if he had survived a few more weeks on this island,

384
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:33,038
你就会明白的
you'd have figured that out.

385
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:36,076
你刚说什么?
What did you just say?

386
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:44,089
我这蠢蛋 我说了吗?
Ah,damn. Didn't I tell you?

387
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:49,023
山谷传来声音说圣人Jack被埋进洞里了
Word from the valley is St. Jack got himself buried in a cave-in.

388
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,062
往好的方面想 现在你总算有人可同情了
Look at the bright side. Now you have someone else to pity.

389
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:08,071
听着  伙计  慢慢爬  好吗?
Listen, man, go slow, all right?

390
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:11,013
不要推身边的石块
Try not to nudge any of the rocks around you.

391
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:12,089
还有呢?
Anything else?

392
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,000
是的
Yeah.

393
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,038
好运
Good luck.

394
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:17,055
小心点  老兄
Be safe, man.

395
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:19,019
祝你好运  Charlie
Good luck, Charlie.

396
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,054
好吧  谢谢  朋友们
All right. Thanks, guys.

397
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:05,027
晕啊
Bloody hell.

398
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:10,028
小兄弟  随你挑哪个妞  坐吧
Hey, baby brother, grab a bird and sit down.

399
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:12,027
出去
Get out.

400
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:13,088
你也是  出去
You too, get out.

401
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:18,005
快  现在!!
Come on, now.

402
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:19,031
5分种后回来
Come back in five minutes.

403
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,030
声道检测
Sound check.

404
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,042
你误了声道检测
You missed sound check.

405
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:29,076
你连排练都没来
You don't show up for rehearsal.

406
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:30,087
一小时后就要表演了
We've got a show in an hour.

407
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:33,035
表演  我喜欢表演
Ooh, show. I like shows.

408
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:37,030
是的
Ah, yeah.

409
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:41,006
好
All right.

410
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:42,028
够了
That's it.

411
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:43,099
今晚过后  剩下的巡回演出全部取消
After tonight, we cancel the rest of the tour.

412
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:47,042
大家走人
And walk away.

413
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,080
你想就此了事?
Are you off your end?

414
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:51,019
我们说好当事情变得..... 我们就走人
We're walking away like we said we would if things got

415
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,021
走人?去哪?
Walk away and go where?

416
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,058
Liam  这些垃圾会害了你的!
Liam, you're killing yourself with this junk!

417
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:59,036
-你在毁了整个"驱轴乐队" -我就是"驱轴乐队"!
-You're destroying Driveshaft!-I am Driveshaft!

418
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:02,088
甚至没人知道贝斯手是谁!
Nobody even knows who the sodding bass player is!

419
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,014
行了  Charlie
This is it, Charlie.

420
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,038
事情都这样了
End of the rainbow.

421
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:08,042
你真认为你能走人?
Do you really think you can walk away?

422
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:10,023
知道不  恩?
Then what, eh?

423
00:27:10,077 --> 00:27:14,093
面对吧  看看这个乐队  你在乐队有个屁用啊?
Face it, if you're notin this band, what the bloody hell use are you?

424
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:20,065
Liam

425
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:21,080
滚开!
Piss off!

426
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,020
Charlie?!

427
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:30,003
Charlie  快爬!
Charlie, move!

428
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:31,090
Charlie!

429
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:04,045
我  ...
I'm, uh...

430
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,096
我是来救你的
I'm here to rescue you.

431
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,082
-我们再试一次  -我们不能就这么走了...
-I say we try again.  -We can't just leave

432
00:29:15,097 --> 00:29:17,051
如果我们走了  他们会闷死在里面的
If we don't move, they're gonna run out of air.

433
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:19,020
嘿  不要再说了!再仔细想想
would you stop talking? I'm trying to think!

434
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,069
他在哪儿?他在哪儿?!
Where is he? Where is he?!

435
00:29:21,078 --> 00:29:22,049
Kate

436
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,097
他在哪儿?Jack在哪儿?
Where is he? Where's Jack?

437
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,065
他在里面
He's in there.

438
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:39,009
他还活着吗?
Does anyone know if he's alive?

439
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:43,011
-他还活着吗?!  -我们不知道
-Is he alive?!  -We don't know.

440
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:45,003
我们挖了一条道  Charlie爬进去了
Charlie went in there through a tunnel that we dug,

441
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,024
但又塌了
but it collapsed.

442
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:52,046
为什么不挖了?
Why 1is nobody digging?

443
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,065
好  1  2... 3!
Okay, 1, 2... 3!

444
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:15,031
对不起  Jack  对不起
Sorry, Jack. Sorry.

445
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:16,080
你还行吗?
You all right?

446
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,098
我肩膀脱臼了
My shoulder is dislocated.

447
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,071
你得帮我把它弄回去
You're gonna have to pop it back in.

448
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:27,070
-不  我做不到  -我需要你的帮忙  伙计
-No, I can't.  -I need your help on this, man.

449
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:29,037
-我真做不到  Jack  -行的  你做的到的
-I can't do it, Jack.  -Yes, you can.

450
00:30:29,047 --> 00:30:30,087
你能做到的
Yes, you can.

451
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,039
好吧
Okay.

452
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:35,064
那我...那我该怎么做?
What do I...what do I do?

453
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:39,025
抓住我的手
Take my hand.

454
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:41,051
等等  好  好  等
Just a sec. Okay. Okay, wait.

455
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:42,085
好  好了
Okay. Okay.

456
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:47,080
现在  我一说拉 你就尽最大的力气拉
Now, when I tell you to, pull as hard as you possibly can.

457
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:49,047
Jack  我不知道我是否能...我不知道...
Jack, I don't know if I can...I don't...

458
00:30:49,062 --> 00:30:51,011
你能够做到的  Charlie
You can do this, Charlie.

459
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:55,002
好  好  好...
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

460
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,019
拉
Now.

461
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:35,054
Charlie

462
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:37,023
你来干吗了?
What you doing here?

463
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:39,089
什么  这么长时间 小子就不能来拜访大兄弟了?
What, a bloke can't pay his big brother a visit once in a while?

464
00:31:40,013 --> 00:31:43,004
当然可以  真蠢 干吗不先打个电话?
Of course he can. Why didn't you call, you lunatic?

465
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:44,039
你在悉尼做什么呢?
What are you doing in Sydney?

466
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:47,002
都安排妥当了  Liam
It's all lined up, Liam.

467
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,075
跟随一个叫"Meat Coat"的乐队 巡回演出8周
Eight weeks on tour opening for some band called Meat Coat.

468
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:54,065
第一场演唱会在洛山矶举办
First gig's in Los Angeles.

469
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:57,084
洛山矶啊  Liam
L.A., Liam.

470
00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:01,080
这是再次给自己 打造品牌的好机会啊
This is a chance to get back on a label.

471
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,075
一个真正的机会
A real one.

472
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,069
是我们复出的时候了
This is our comeback.

473
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:12,039
Charlie  我不想复出了
Charlie, I don't want to come back.

474
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:18,051
好  呃  事情其实是这样
Yeah, right. Well, here's the thing.

475
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:23,094
没有你  他们就不要"驱轴乐队"
They won't book Driveshaft without you.

476
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:27,072
所以我请你...
So I'm asking...

477
00:32:28,068 --> 00:32:29,095
以一个兄弟的身份...
as a brother...

478
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:33,058
就如你以前请我一样
the way you asked me.

479
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,040
我错过Megan生日的那晚 你和我在一起
You were with me the night I missed Megan's birth.

480
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:41,094
你是一块我想在Drenden开演唱会的绊脚石
You were the one I was stumbling around Dresden with trying to find a sodding fix.

481
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:52,074
-伙计  你还在用  是不是?  -不要转换话题
-Ah, man, you're still using, aren't you?  -Oh, don't change the subject.

482
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:54,058
那就是你不回我电话的原因
That's why you haven't been returning my calls.

483
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:56,068
-这巡回演出  你到底去还是不去?  -你说过你会戒掉的
-You gonna go on tour with us or not?  -You said you'd get help, man.

484
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:59,043
-你的号码  我找不到了  -看来你还是有毒隐!
-I lost your sodding number.  -You're still a junkie!

485
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:00,091
是你把我弄成这样的!
Well, you did this to me!

486
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:02,099
还说是为了音乐!
It was about the music!

487
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:08,033
音乐  Liam
Music, Liam.

488
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,054
你把它从我身上带走了
You took that away from me.

489
00:33:13,047 --> 00:33:18,002
听着  你和我们一块儿住几周吧!
Listen, why don't you stay with us for a few weeks?

490
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,081
Karen和我会想办法帮你的
Karen and me, we can get you help.

491
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,000
悉尼还是有很多好节目的
Sydney's got some really good programs.

492
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,004
算了吧
Forget it.

493
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,002
不要走
Don't go.

494
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,069
-感谢你的帮忙  兄弟  -留下吧  求你了
-Thanks for your help, brother.  -Stay, please.

495
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,067
我要照顾好你的!
I'm just looking out for you!

496
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,052
你从来没照顾过我!
You never looked out for me!

497
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,099
我还有个计划
I have a plane to catch.

498
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:49,014
这样已经多久了  Charlie?
How long has it been, Charlie?

499
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:52,025
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're going on about.

500
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:54,046
距离上一次吸毒已经多久了?
How long since your last fix?

501
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:02,050
差不多有1天半了
Almost a day and a half.

502
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,078
没毒品吸  感觉怎样?
How's the withdrawal treating you?

503
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:06,083
有幻觉?
Any hallucinations?

504
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:11,026
除了和你一小时前 在丛林里的谈话
Apart from the conversation I had with you about an hour ago in the jungle?

505
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:13,026
应该说没有
No, not really.

506
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,039
你干吗不说出来?
Why didn't you say anything?

507
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:19,065
我可以帮你度过这个难关的
I could have helped you through this.

508
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:23,030
是的  你一定认为我是个没用的 彻头彻尾的隐君子
Yeah. You thinking I'm useless and a junkie to boot.

509
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:24,082
没用?
Useless?

510
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,009
你才不会没用
You're not useless.

511
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:30,020
爬进来救我需要多么大的勇气
That took a lot of guts getting in here and trying to rescue me.

512
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,052
我不会忘记的
I won't forget that.

513
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:34,078
我们的余生吗?
For the rest of our lives?

514
00:34:39,062 --> 00:34:42,018
以我们呼吸氧气的速度
At the rate we're using our oxygen in here,

515
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,032
维持不了多久了
that won't be too long.

516
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:48,046
这地方...
This place...

517
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:50,016
让我想到忏悔
it reminds me of confession.

518
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:53,089
在这个狭小紧闭的空间
This little claustrophobic booth.

519
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,078
我还不知道你是个有宗教信仰的人
I wouldn't have taken you for a religious man.

520
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,061
我过去是
I used to be.

521
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:03,018
想听我祷告吗?
Hey, you want to hear my confession?

522
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,040
或许得花点时间
It might take a while.

523
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,026
我也不是什么高徒
Hey, I'm no saint, either.

524
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,085
怎么了?
What's wrong?

525
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:16,012
有蛾
There's a moth.

526
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:17,044
有什么?
A what?

527
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:18,089
就在你后面  看  看
Right behind you. Look, look.

528
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:20,058
这儿有哦!!
There's a bloody moth in here.

529
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,011
看
Look.

530
00:35:24,062 --> 00:35:26,008
Charlie  你干什么?
Charlie, what are you doing?

531
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,034
Kate  你休息一下吧
Hey, Kate, you need to take a break.

532
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,063
我没事儿
I'm fine.

533
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:53,084
挖的人够了
We got enough people to dig.

534
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:56,003
你要是保持这样的节奏挖 自己会先垮的
You keep going at this pace, you're gonna kill yourself.

535
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:02,052
有光
There's light.

536
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,027
什么?
What?

537
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:05,051
我看见光了!
I can see light!

538
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,083
是医生!
Hey, it's the doctor!

539
00:36:58,009 --> 00:36:59,067
轻点儿!
Oh! Ow! Easy!

540
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,093
我的肩
My shoulder.

541
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:03,008
小心
Careful.

542
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,088
你们怎么出来的?
How'd you get out?

543
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,043
Charlie  是Charlie想的办法出来的

After all you've been through. Take it easy, man.
