1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,027
"其它人"就要来了
The Others are coming.

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:08,000
我们只有3个选择  跑  躲  要么就是死
You have only three choices: Run, hide, or die.

3
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:09,058
我们确实有个计划
We do have a plan.

4
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:11,067
你去丛林里弄些炸药回来
Yeah, go to the jungle,

5
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:15,004
然后炸开舱盖让大家躲进去
get some dynamite, blow open a hatch,hide everyone inside.

6
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,034
不
No.

7
00:00:17,044 --> 00:00:20,006
停下  快停下
Stop! Stop it!

8
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,009
停下  我们不能这么做
Stop it, we can't!

9
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,056
停下  别点着
Stop, don't light it!

迷 失
第二季 第一集

13
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,093
4  8  我们死定了  15  注定要死了...
4, 8, We're dead. 15. Doomed and dead.

14
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,005
Hurley  你还好吧?
Hurley, you OK?

15
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:25,024
噢  是的  还不错  我想去尿尿
Huh? Yeah. Awesome.I just...have to pee.

16
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:29,080
好主意  你们两个...去看看那个着火的死亡之洞吧
Great idea, dude, go look in the burning death hole.

17
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,075
这到底是什么?
What is it?

18
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:49,016
是什么并不重要
It doesn't matter what it is.

19
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:52,030
我们炸开舱门就能让大家在里面安全避难了么?
We blew the door so we could get everyone inside so they'd be safe.

20
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,000
这计划不会管用的
That plan is not gonna work.

21
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,076
我们不可能让大家都能及时下去
We'll never get everyone down in time.

22
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:09,084
-是水  -很浅  更像是一个污水坑
-Water.  -Shallow. Sounds like a puddle.

23
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:11,098
-大概...在下面40英尺处?  -最多50
-40 feet down?  -50, tops.

24
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:14,017
我们可以用从机身上拉下来的绳子
We could use the wire from the fuselage,

25
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:15,015
绕在身上作为保护
rig up a harness...

26
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:19,049
-John  我们要走了  -是的  好主意  我们照做好了
-John, we're leaving now.  -Yes. Great idea, let's do that.

27
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,061
我们经历了好多磨难才走到这一步  Jack
We all went through a lot to get here.

28
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:23,082
梯子已经坏了
The ladder is broken.

29
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:26,062
你要让40个人一个个从这儿下去?
You're gonna lower 40 people down there one by one?

30
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:29,000
他们正等着我们回去告诉他们怎么做
They're waiting for us to tell them what do,

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,068
别去做那什么保护索了
so forget the harnesses.

32
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,043
Jack

33
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:33,045
怎么?
What?

34
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,040
我们还是冷静一下吧
Why don't we all just calm down here?

35
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,049
听着  如果你想在白天下去探险的话  没问题
No, if you wanna go exploring in the morning, fine,

36
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:39,094
但是今晚  我们收工了
but tonight we're done.

37
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:44,095
我去拿我们没用过的炸药  然后我们回营地去
I'm gonna get the dynamite we didn't use and we're heading back to the caves.

38
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:49,085
John  你来帮忙包炸药怎么样?
So how about you pack it up, John?

39
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,079
可以  当然可以
Sure. Of course.

40
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,026
好的
OK.

41
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:06,002
Jack  你为什么不想下去看看?
Why don't you want to go down there,Jack?

42
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,028
女性  将近30岁  没有身份证明
Female, late twenties, no ID.

43
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:13,079
她第二次来这儿做电击了
Coded twice on the way over here...

44
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,074
另一个呢?
Where's the other one?

45
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,059
在我们后面  马上来了
They're on their way.

46
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,073
消防队得占用一下进口
Fire department had to use the jaws.

47
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,072
伤者的情况?
What do we got?

48
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,051
女性  将近30岁
Female, late twenties, auto accident.

49
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,083
那到底是什么东西?
What is that?

50
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,033
驾驶杆的一部分
A piece of the steering column.

51
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,076
好了  我们开始  抓稳她的领口

-车是她开得么?  -是的  就她一个人
-Pericardial's pierced. Was she driving?  -Yeah. Alone.

57
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:37,005
城市越野车的驾驶员呢?
Where's the driver of the SUV?

-Tube Mr Rutherford...  -I can't intubate, you've got to.

Sheppard医生  她的血压已经降到60到80了
Dr Shephard, her BP's 80/60.

61
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:51,096
好了  我要一个注射器  大点的

62
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:54,071
你  帮忙压紧点

65
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,034
-注射器  -给你

70
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:34,069
把她带去重症监护室  别让她动
Get her up to ICU and keep her immobilised.

71
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:40,096
我想在婚礼上...跳舞

72

她说她想在她婚礼上跳舞

76
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:04,008
那儿没人

77
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,040
没人会来的
No one is coming.

78
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,082
但是那个法国女人说过...
But the French woman said...

79
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:09,037
那个法国女人有点不正常  你知道么?
The French woman is missing a bloody wing nut.

80
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:12,046
我是说  那全是胡说的  只是一个鬼故事罢了
I mean, it was all bollocks.It's a ghost story.

81
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:15,031
黑烟是她自己点的
She set the fire herself.

82
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,026
怎么了?
What?

83
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:20,058
没什么
Nothing.

84
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,088
有人见到Vincent么?
Has anyone seen Vincent?

85
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:30,087
那只狗  有人见到它么?
The dog? Anyone seen him?

86
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:32,069
有人看见那只狗么?
Has anyone seen the dog?

87
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,065
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

88
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:38,037
那只狗走丢了
I lost the damn dog.

89
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,081
你为什么这么做?
Why'd you do that?

90
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,079
你为什么要点燃导火线?
Why'd you light the fuse, man?

91
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:56,016
我为什么不点呢?
Why wouldn't I light the fuse?

92
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:59,052
因为我正跑向你
Maybe because I was running towards you,

93
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:02,058
挥着手  大叫着  别这么做
waving my arms,yelling, "Don't do that!"

94
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:07,035
恩  你说到点子上了
Well, you've got a point there.

95
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:10,089
我猜可能是因为我很想进去看看吧
I guess I was excited to get inside.

96
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,065
我是说我们就是为了这个而来的  不是么?
That's why we came here, isn't it?

97
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,050
就是为了这个我们才这么大老远跑去"黑岩石"那儿
That's why we went out to the Black Rock,

98
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,001
带回炸药炸开了舱盖
and got the dynamite to blow the hatch.

99
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,014
我们这么做了所以我们才能躲进去  Hugo
We did it so we could get inside, Hugo.

100
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:21,024
然后拯救大家
And to save everybody's lives.

101
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:24,032
然后拯救大家
And to save everyone's lives.

102
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,064
或者说这就是我们的命运  对么  John?
Or maybe it was just our destiny. Right, John?

103
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,047
也许是
Maybe.

104
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:34,014
伙计们  呃  这个舱盖...
Guys. It's the hatch door.

105
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:36,046
你们最好过来看看
You'd better see this.

106
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,060
检疫隔离

107
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,011
Vincent

108
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,005
别走太远了
This is not a good idea.

109
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,056
5分钟前我还看见它的
I saw him five minutes ago.

110
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:50,099
况且你也说过  那儿根本没有其它人
Besides,you said there wasn't anyone out here.

111
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:53,019
我是说我们没见到任何人
I said we didn't see anyone.

112
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:55,064
那只狗会自己回来的  它总是这样的
The dog will come back on his own,he always does.

113
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:59,093
看管那只狗是别人第一次拜托我的事
Watching that dog was the one thing anybody ever asked me to do.

114
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:02,057
如果它有个什么三长两短...
If something happens to him...

115
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:05,018
你上一次睡觉或是吃东西是在什么时候?
When was the last time you slept or had something to eat?

116
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,093
你已经有点虚脱了
You're exhausted.

117
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:11,017
我不能告诉那个孩子我丢了他的狗只是因为我太累了
I can't tell that kid I lost his dog because I was exhausted.

118
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:19,045
我从后面抓它
I'll circle around behind him.

119
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:20,092
好的
OK.

120
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:33,026
Vincent

121
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:36,011
Sayid

122
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,093
Sayid

123
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:49,046
你在哪儿?  Sayid
Where are you!? Sayid!

124
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,084
Sayid

125
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:23,038
Walt?

126
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:31,079
你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

127
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,087
Shannon

128
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:39,016
怎么了?
What is it?

129
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,049
什么?
What?

130
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:56,080
你为什么这么想下去?
Why do you want to get down there so bad?

131
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,065
小姐  我为什么这么想下去?
"- Ly". Why do I want to get down there so "badly"?

132
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:03,063
Jack认为我疯了  是么?
Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he?

133
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:07,034
为什么?  因为你想从一个写着"检疫隔离"
Why? Cos you want to drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside

134
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:11,018
并从里面锁住了的舱门里进去?
by a foot-thick steel door that says "Quarantine"?

135
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:14,017
恩  往好的方面想想吧  舱门已经被毁了
Look at the bright side:The damage is done.

136
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:16,030
好的方面
Bright side.

137
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,049
如果Jack认为我有点疯狂  我不怪他  真的
And if Jack thinks I've lost it,I can't blame him, really.

138
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:23,077
并且5个小时以前  我差点被一个看起来
Then again, five hours ago I was pulled into a hole

139
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:27,006
像柱状的黑烟拉进洞里
by what appeared to be a column of black smoke.

140
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:30,072
你看到了么  Kate?
Did you see it, Kate?

141
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:36,025
那么我想我们都疯了
Then I guess we're both crazy.

142
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:39,075
想想Jack认为他看见了什么
I wonder what Jack thinks he saw.

143
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,088
伙计  你得有所行动了
You should go ahead, man.

144
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:47,068
别让Locke有时间和你的女人在一起
Don't want Locke making time with your girl.

145
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:49,023
伙计  说笑罢了
Joke, dude.

146
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,001
现在没有这个心情  Hurley
Not really in the mood, Hurley.

147
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:56,004
真的么?  你通常总像是哈哈先生
Really? Wow.Usually you're like, Mr Ha-ha.

148
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,072
你想想
There ya go.

149
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:59,091
生活不是那么糟糕  是么?
Life's not so bad, right?

150
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:02,041
我是说  是的  "其它人"就要来...也许是吃了我们
Sure, the Others are coming to like, eat us all,

151
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,055
然后偶尔的  有些人把火气全撒在你头上
and every once in a while someone blows up all over you,

152
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:08,036
但是我们每天还是要睡觉的
but we do get to sleep in every morning.

153
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:11,029
恩哈  那些数字怎么说?
And the numbers?

154
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,071
什么?
What?

155
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:15,013
"那些不是好数字"
"The numbers are bad. "

156
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:19,000
当我扭住你的时候你是这么叫的
That's what you were yelling right when I tackled you.

157
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,060
-是的  说来话长  -我有时间
-Yeah. It's kind of a long story.  -I've got time.

158
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,095
-你会认为我疯了  -说说看
-You'll think I'm crazy.  -Try me.

159
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:33,055
以前  我在神经病监护室的时候
A while ago, I was in this kind of psych ward

160
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,009
有个叫Leonard的人
and there was this guy, Leonard.

161
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,065
我每次见到他  他总是在说这些数字
All the time I knew him,all he ever said were these numbers.

162
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:42,090
4,8,15,16,23,42,一遍一遍又一遍的重复
"4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42".Over and over and over again.

163
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,092
然后它们就深深得印在我的脑子里了
And they kind of got stuck in my head.

164
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:46,052
当我出来的时候
So when I got out...

165
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:49,005
呃  实际上是当我出来后几个月
well, actually a couple months after I got out,

166
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:52,082
有次我在买冰冻墨西哥玉米煎饼的时候 我突然想我该去玩彩票
I was buying a frozen burrito and thought "I should play the lottery",

167
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:56,034
我就用印在我脑子里的这些数字买了号码
and I guess those numbers were stuck in my head, so I played them.

168
00:13:56,034 --> 00:14:01,057
然后我就赢了1亿1千4百万
And I won... $114 million.

169
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,022
接下来事情发生了
That's when it started happening.

170
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,080
我的爷爷死了
My grandpa died,

171
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,092
我的房子着火了
my house caught on fire,

172
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:10,042
我工作的鸡肉店被流星给撞了...
the chicken joint that I worked at got hit by a meteor...

173
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:13,096
呃...事实上是陨石
Well, actually, a meteorite.

174
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:18,039
好了  今晚我在那个舱盖上又看到了这些数字
OK, so, tonight, I see the same freaking numbers on that hatch thing.

175
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,051
刻在边上
Just written on the side.

176
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:24,046
所以我就想要阻止你们  因为那个东西是被诅咒了的  伙计
And that's why I tried to stop it,because that thing is cursed, man.

177
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:32,042
你曾经被送进精神病医院?
You were in a psych ward?

178
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:36,026
-我不是疯子  -我没说你是
-I'm not crazy.  -I'm not saying you are.

179
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:39,023
那么  好了?  就这样了?
So, what, that's it? That's all?

180
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:41,095
-你想让我说什么?  -你为什么不相信我?
-What do you want me to say?  -How about you believe me?

181
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:45,062
Hurley  它们只是数字
Hurley, they're numbers.

182
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:52,012
医生通过谈话来让病人觉得好过的行为叫什么?
What's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?

183
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:55,096
-医生的举止  -恩  就是那个
-Bedside manner.  -Yeah, that.

184
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:59,085
你做得糟透了  伙计
Yours sucks, dude.

185
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:15,018
他怎么样了?
What happened to him?

186
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:18,070
放松点  好么?
Just try to relax, OK?

187
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:20,099
我撞上的那辆车
The car that I hit.

188
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:23,039
那个司机年级较大
The other driver was older...

189
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,062
他在抢救室里死了
He died in the ER.

190
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:33,081
我全身都没有知觉
I can't feel anything.

191
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:36,070
我知道
I know.

192
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:41,092
我怎么了?
What's happened to me?

193
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,071
你的脊椎骨脱臼并骨折了
You have a fracture dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine,

194
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:49,082
而且多处是粉碎性的
with multiple crushed vertebrae.

195
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:53,016
你的背脊断了
Your back is broken.

196
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:57,036
你的脾撕裂了血都流向了腹部  我们得设法控制住
Your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen and has to be stopped.

197
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,088
我会进行外科手术
I'm gonna operate

198
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:00,063
尽最大可能医好你
and repair as much as possible,

199
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:03,029
但是最乐观的结果也只能是
but even the most optimistic result puts

200
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:06,033
保持你腰部以下的感觉能力和移动能力...
the likelihood of retaining any feeling

201
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:13,032
不过基本上是不可能的了
or mobility anywhere below the waist at extremely unlikely...

202
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:19,050
Shephard医生?
Dr Shephard,

203
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,049
可以和你说两句么?
may I have a word, please?

204
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,069
那么  我哪儿做错了?
So, what'd I do wrong?

205
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,081
你做错事了?
You did something wrong?

206
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:30,090
你在皱眉
You're frowning.

207
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,060
我的脸总是这种表情
My face is always this way.

208
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,024
爸爸  嘿  好了
Dad, hey, come on,

209
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:38,015
说来听听
let's hear it.

210
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:44,026
偶尔你应该给病人一些希望
You might want to try handing out some hope every once in a while?

211
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:46,091
即使有99%的可能彻底无药可治
Even if there's a 99 per cent probability

212
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:48,075
家属们还是会倾向于听到这1%的机会
that they're hopelessly screwed,

213
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:56,033
这样就没什么问题
folks are much more inclined to hear that one per cent chance that things are gonna be OK.

214
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,036
她的脊椎被碾碎了
Her spine is crushed.

215
00:16:58,036 --> 00:17:00,040
而我告诉她一切都会好的
I tell her that everything's gonna be OK,

216
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,083
那是误导的希望  爸爸
that's false hope, Dad.

217
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,047
也许你是对的
Maybe. Maybe.

218
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:09,057
但那还是希望
But it's still hope.

219
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,063
我知道我看见了什么
I know what I saw!

220
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,088
是他  是Walt
It was him. It was Walt.

221
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:26,095
Shannon  轻点声  你会使其他人不安的
Shannon Please lower your voice. You upset others.

222
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,089
我听到了耳语声
I heard whispers.

223
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,007
-哪儿?  -到处都是
-Where?  -Everywhere.

224
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,026
-什么耳语?  -我不知道  是他们
-What whispers? Who?  -I don't know! "Them".

225
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:33,041
你认为是救生筏出了什么问题了么?
Do you think something happened to the raft?

226
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,015
救生筏没事  Walt和你的丈夫在一起
Nothing happened to the roft. Walt was with your husband, Sawyer...

227
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:39,006
Sayid  我亲眼看见的
Sayid, I know what I saw!

228
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:41,028
他们回来了
They're back.

229
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:59,088
Locke找到了  呃...
Locke found a...

230
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:05,006
离这儿半英里外的一个舱门
...hatch in the ground about a half mile from here.

231
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:08,038
我们去把它炸开了  这样大家都可以躲在里面了
We left to blow it open so we could hide inside.

232
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:13,057
大家都可以躲在里面了  以防万一...
So all of us could hide inside in case...

233
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,045
但是现在不用去考虑这个了 因为那没什么用
But it doesn't matter,it's not gonna work,

234
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:20,040
今晚我们没有办法下去
there's no way for all of us to get in there tonight.

235
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,038
Jack

236
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,014
Arzt博士呢?
where's Dr Arzt?

237
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,071
呃  他没能和我们一起回来
He didn't make it.

238
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:32,056
你们看见他们了么?
Did you see them?

239
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:34,026
你们看到"其他人"了么?
Did you see the Others?

240
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:39,097
Shannon  没有什么其他人  我们已经谈过了
Hey! Shannon! There are no "Others".We've had this conversation.

241
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:56,048
一切都会好的
Everything's going to be OK.

242
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:59,093
我们...我们放松点  我们会没事的
Let's just... let's take it easy.We're gonna be all right.

243
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:03,012
我们今晚就呆在这儿  好么?  我们一起
We're gonna stay here tonight, OK?Together.

244
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:08,081
我们还有4把枪  并且会在所有的进出口设岗哨的
We've still got four guns.We'll put lookouts at all the entrances.

245
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:13,042
只要我们大家呆在一块儿我们就会没事的
We're all gonna be safe as long as we stay together.

246
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,085
太阳在3小时内就会升起
The sun comes up in three hours,

247
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:20,010
我们都将会看到明天的日出的
and we are all gonna be here to see that happen.

248
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,048
我保证
I promise.

249
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:37,022
John  你在干什么?
John. What are you doing?

250
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,054
我在弄些绳索
I'm getting some cable.

251
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:42,029
用来干什么?
What for?

252
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:46,094
我要下去舱门里看看
It's for the hatch. I'm going in.

253
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:55,015
你真的认为现在这么做很明智么  John?
You think that's the smartest thing to do right now, John?

254
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,070
我也拿不准
I doubt it.

255
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,073
事实上  你是对的
In fact, you're right.

256
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,096
呆在这里最安全
Safest thing is to stay here.

257
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:03,008
等着日出
Wait for morning.

258
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:07,036
等着看那些"其他人"  看看他们是否会露面
Wait for these "Others",to see if they ever show up.

259
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:11,085
等着救生筏上的勇者带来救兵
Wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help.

260
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:16,010
但是我已经等不下去了
But me? I'm tired of waiting.

261
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:41,013
你相信么?
So, do you believe it?

262
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,023
相信什么?
Believe what?

263
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:51,037
一切都会好的
That everything's gonna be OK.

264
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,016
是的
Yeah.

265
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:57,004
我相信
I do.

266
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:59,042
这有点不像你
Kind of unlike you.

267
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,051
居然如此乐观
The whole glass-half-full thing.

268
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,099
是这样么?
There's a glass?

269
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:14,004
你做了一件好事  说了你说的那些话...
You did a good thing.Saying what you said.

270
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:17,044
照顾所有的人
Taking care of everybody.

271
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:21,077
并且给了他们希望
And just giving them something to count on.

272
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:27,041
如果你当时不在场  Jack...
If you weren't here, Jack...

273
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:35,088
我会从舱门里掉下去
I'm going to the hatch.

274
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:38,085
我知道为什么你不能下去  我是说  他们需要你
I understand why you can't go. I mean,they need you here,

275
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:42,076
我知道  我真的知道
I get it. I do.

276
00:21:44,022 --> 00:21:48,059
但是不管你反不反对  Locke还是会下去
But Locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not.

277
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:52,060
那么如果他摔下去摔断了脖子...
And if he falls and breaks his neck...

278
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:58,018
一起活  单独死  对么?
Live together, die alone, right?

279
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:04,082
是的
Right.

280
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,063
你的未婚妻伤得很重
Your fiancee was seriously injured.

281
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:17,096
手术可能会持续10到12个小时
It could take as long as ten,maybe twelve hours.

282
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:23,053
我只有手术时才能知道她伤得有多重
I won't know how extensive the damage is until I get inside.

283
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:31,098
她正准备去试衣和挑选桌布
She was going for a dress fitting and to look at tablecloths.

284
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:35,072
婚礼是...什么时候?
When is it? The wedding?

285
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:38,074
8个月后
It's eight months.

286
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:41,045
我保证Sarah在那以前会恢复的...
I'm sure Sarah will have recovered by then, if...

287
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:45,017
"恢复"?  什么意思?
"Recovered?" What does that mean?

288
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:48,048
现在正在进行物理治疗  但是如果她真的伤得很重...
There will be ongoing physical therapy,but if she works really hard...

289
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:56,065
我们能  呃...做爱么?
Will we be able to...you know... make love?

290
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:00,016
你得知道Sara在她下半辈子可能一直需要
You need to know that there is a chance

291
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:05,049
很好的专业护理
Sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life.

292
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:11,073
就像...她不能独自去浴室?
What, like, she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself?

293
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:29,056
过来
Come here.

294
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:33,000
过来
Come here.

295
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:38,022
我要告诉你一个秘密
I want to tell you a little secret.

296
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,090
来吧
Come on.

297
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,092
近一点
Closer.

298
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:53,074
可以了
It's OK.

299
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:59,028
我知道我再也不能跳舞了
I know I'm not gonna be dancing anymore.

300
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:10,063
但我还是能参加我的婚礼
I can still roll around at my wedding.

301
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:15,048
到时你也来  好么?
You're invited, OK?

302
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:23,004
我会医好你的
I'm going to fix you.

303
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:57,091
本来以为现在你已经下去了
Expected to find you halfway down there by now.

304
00:24:57,091 --> 00:25:01,037
我在等你
I was waiting for you.

305
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:12,081
那么你是想让我先下去?
So you want me to go down first?

306
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:14,069
是的  你比较轻
Well, you're lighter.

307
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:18,035
我能放你下去也能轻松得把你拉上来
I can belay you down and bring you back up just as easy.

308
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:21,013
通道在下面也可能会变窄
Shaft might get narrower down there, too.

309
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:25,012
你在上面就是因为你想看看我有没有被什么东西吃掉
You left out the part where you just wanna see if I get eaten by something.

310
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:29,017
是的  恩  那也是一个原因
Yeah, well. That too.

311
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:34,068
-不会太紧吧?  -刚好
-Not too tight?  -I've got it.

312
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:42,034
好了
OK.

313
00:25:58,077 --> 00:26:00,077
等等
Wait.

314
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:03,062
如果我想停下我该怎么说?
What do I say if need to stop?

315
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:06,062
"停下"
"Stop."

316
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:10,026
恩  好的
Right. OK.

317
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:14,040
好的  我去了
Let's go.

318
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:10,042
啊  Kate  你还好么?
Kate! Are you all right?

319
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,032
还好
Yeah.

320
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:19,031
我把手电筒掉了
I dropped the light.

321
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:22,035
我们也许应该...
Maybe we should...

322
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:26,000
呃  那好吧
Well, OK, then.

323
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:53,082
停下
Stop!

324
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,050
看见什么了?
What is it?

325
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,079
John

326
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,010
下面好像有什么东西...
I think there's something down...

327
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,076
Kate  你还好吧?
Kate, are you all right?

328
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:34,002
Kate

329
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:36,032
Kate

330
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:39,032
Kate

331
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:45,029
你在说笑吧?
You're kidding, right?

332
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:47,031
你要回去那儿?
You're going back?

333
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:48,027
是的
Yeah.

334
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:51,003
你自己说的要我们等到天亮
What about all that stuff you said about waiting until morning

335
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:53,085
并且看到日出
and watching the sun rise?

336
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:57,027
我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

337
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,078
Kate

338
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:27,065
Locke

339
00:30:51,054 --> 00:30:54,012
混蛋
Damn it!

340
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:55,037
兄弟  你还好吧?
You all right, brother?

341
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:56,084
我没事  没事
I'm fine. I'm fine.

342
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:58,074
放松点  把绑带卸下来
Take it easy, keep the weight off.

343
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:01,062
来  我看看
Here, let me look.

344
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:03,064
很痛么?
Does this hurt?

345
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:06,065
恩  你没有扭伤
Well, you haven't sprained it, then.

346
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:09,041
但我认为今晚你没机会能追上我了
Don't fancy your chances of catching up, though.

347
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,095
我没想着要追上你
I wasn't trying to catch up.

348
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:14,077
好吧  你不是这么想的
Oh, aye, 'course you weren't.

349
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,038
你是怎么知道我没有扭伤的?
What do you know about sprains?

350
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,095
我以前可以说是一个医生
I was almost a doctor, once.

351
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:22,058
世界真是很小
Small world.

352
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:26,009
那么说你也是医生?
You're a doctor, then?

353
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:39,090
那你有什么理由?
So what's your excuse?

354
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,008
理由?
Excuse?

355
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:44,063
跑得好像后面有恶魔追着你一样的理由
For running like the Devil's chasing you?

356
00:31:44,063 --> 00:31:47,099
我的理由...我在训练
My excuse: I'm training.

357
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:49,026
为了什么训练?
Training for what?

358
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:52,032
为了跑遍全球
For a race around the world.

359
00:31:52,032 --> 00:31:55,088
我知道很令人惊讶
Impressive, I know.

360
00:31:56,075 --> 00:32:00,005
那么你的理由最好也能说得过去  兄弟
So your excuse better be good, brother.

361
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,037
只是为了想些事情
Just trying to work a few things out.

362
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:08,001
一个女孩  是么?
A girl, right?

363
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,081
一个病人
A patient.

364
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:13,089
啊  一个女病人
Ah, but, a girl patient.

365
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:19,001
她叫什么名字?
What's her name?

366
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:22,027
她叫Sarah
Her name's Sarah.

367
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,049
那么你对她做了什么?
What'd you do to her, then?

368
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,074
做了什么?
Do to her?

369
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:30,084
你这么自我摧残肯定是做了一些有价值的事
You must have done something worthy of this self-flagellation.

370
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:35,008
我告诉她...
I told her...

371
00:32:35,008 --> 00:32:38,036
我做了一个承诺但我无法履行
I made a promise I couldn't keep.

372
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:41,022
我告诉她我会医好她...
I told her I'd fix her

373
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,095
但是不能
and I couldn't.

374
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:47,023
我失败了
I failed.

375
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:55,065
再问一下...
Just one thing...

376
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,018
如果你医好了她呢?
What if you did fix her?

377
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,040
我没有
I didn't.

378
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,056
但是如果你做到了呢?
But what if you did?

379
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:04,026
伙计  你不知道你现在在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

380
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:05,083
我不知道?  我怎么会不知道?
I don't? Why not?

381
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:10,065
因为在她的情况看来  能医好那真是奇迹了  兄弟
With her situation,that would be a miracle, "brother".

382
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:16,027
那你就是不相信奇迹了?
And you don't believe in miracles.

383
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:20,094
是的
Right.

384
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:26,037
无论如何我再给你个建议吧
Well, then.I'm gonna give you some advice, anyway.

385
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:31,021
你得把它抬起来
You have to lift it up.

386
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:39,006
把它抬起来?
Lift it up?

387
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,064
你的脚踝
Your ankle.

388
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:46,093
得让它保持住一定的高度
You got to keep it elevated.

389
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:49,090
聊得真愉快
It's been nice chatting...

390
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,047
Jack

391
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:54,097
Jack  我是Desmond
Jack, I'm Desmond.

392
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:56,080
那么  兄弟  祝你好运
Well, good luck, brother.

393
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,051
在新生活中再见了  好么?
See you in another life, yeah?

394
00:37:45,086 --> 00:37:49,023
我不会这么做
I wouldn't do that.

395
00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:52,058
Kate在哪儿?
Where's Kate?

396
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:55,097
你到底做了...
What the hell's...

397
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,074
我还活着么?
Am I alive?

398
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:26,003
是,是的  你还活着
Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.

399
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:33,047
你身上有气味
You smell.

400
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,081
谢谢
Well, thank you.

401
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:39,004
你身上气味很浓
Wow. You really smell.

402
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:43,001
是  我...我去跑过步了
Yeah, I went for a run.

403
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:46,044
好像你跑了很远
You smell like you ran far.

404
00:38:46,044 --> 00:38:48,076
我淋过浴了  我是说  我想我现在不是太酷
Well, I showered.I guess I just didn't cool...

405
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:56,032
我在一个竞技场里跑步 现在回来想再来看看你
I wanted to get back down here and check on you and...It was a tour de stade.

406
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:59,019
什么?
What?

407
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:05,026
就是在体育场的每一个区里上上下下地跑
When you run all the steps in every section of a stadium. Up and down.

408
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:09,025
你为什么那么做?
Why would you do that?

409
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:13,033
我很紧张
I'm intense.

410
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:15,037
那现在好了么?
Did you finish?

411
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:19,044
没有  我又伤了我的脚踝
No, I hurt my ankle.

412
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,014
真是糟糕
That sucks for you.

413
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:28,090
Kevin在么?  我的未婚夫
Is Kevin here? My fiance?

414
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,099
