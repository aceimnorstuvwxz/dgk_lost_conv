00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:38,094
哦 那是不可能的
Uh, no, you didn't.

148
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:43,038
当时你还在1公里远的地方
You were, like, a mile away.

149
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:50,022
哦 那是因为...我的听力好吧
Well, I suppose I... I've got good hearing.

150
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:57,035
那你也听到闪电了?
You... hear the lightning as well?

151
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:59,064
什么?
Excuse me?

152
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:01,070
那闪电
The lightning.

153
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,057
你碰巧在 Claire 的帐篷外面搭了那个竿子
Just by chance, you pitched your little rod outside Claire's tent,

154
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:10,034
2小时后 闪电就来了
and two hours later, lightning strikes.

155
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:21,089
谢谢你的酒 朋友
Thanks for the drink, pal.

156
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:23,048
嘿 我不知道你在做什么
I don't know what you're doing.

157
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:25,094
你最好告诉我们 喂!
You'd best tell us.

158
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:28,086
你以为转动了那个钥匙 你就是英雄了?
You think because you turned some key, that makes you a hero?

159
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,058
你不是什么英雄 兄弟
You're no hero, brother.

160
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:32,021
我不知道你到底在做什么
I don't know how you're doing

161
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:35,044
但我却看到了个懦夫
but I know a coward when I see one.

162
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:37,068
是啊--
yes

163
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:40,090
你不会想知道在我转动那钥匙后 发生了什么!
You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key!

164
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,038
- 你不会想要知道的 - 伙计
You don't want to know--

165
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:48,032
- 放开我! - 你不会想要知道的!
- You don't want to know!- Get him off!

166
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:01,009
等等!Desmond!
Wait!

167
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:05,010
我们来世再见 兄弟!
I'll see you in another life, brother.

168
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:26,058
我爱你 Penny
I love you, Penny.

169
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,068
我的天啊...
My god.

170
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:46,092
Des 你还好吗?
Des, are you all right?

171
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,078
待在那儿别动
Stay there. Hang on.

172
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,060
我去拿些冰块
I'm just getting ice.

173
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,034
哦 上帝啊
OH, My God.

174
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,022
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

175
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,029
宝贝 你没事吧?
- Sweetie, you okay?

176
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,030
发生了什么?
- What's happening?

177
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,093
你在粉刷天花板时
Well, what's happening is the result of combining ladders,

178
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:05,005
你从梯子上摔下来了
painting the ceiling and alcohol.

179
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:09,053
你还好吗?
Are you okay? Are you nauseous?

180
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:12,002
- 这是我的公寓 - 对啊
This is my flat.

181
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,094
如果你想要我有家的感觉的话
Although if you want me to feel at home here,

182
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:18,029
你最好叫它我们的公寓
you might start calling it our flat.

183
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:22,050
几个手指 Des?
How many fingers, Des?

184
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,036
亲爱的 看着我
Love, look at me.

185
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:28,018
怎么了?
What's wrong?

186
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:38,050
没什么
Absolutely nothing.

187
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:09,002
让我来
Here. Let me.

188
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:13,017
- 谢谢 - 等会儿
- Thanks.- Hang on.

189
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:16,008
脖子上还有油漆的痕迹
You've got paint on your neck.

190
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,091
有吗?

191
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,077
脑震荡好了吗?
How's that concussion?

192
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:23,012
她穿的衣服跟码头工人穿的工作服一样烂
She swore like a docker with a crackin' set of knockers

193
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,066
你来到我的生活中来说...
you move into my humble...

194
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:28,083
根本就不算什么...
is...

195
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:33,060
用"老鼠夹"来形容很恰当吗?
"rat trap" accurate?

196
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:44,045
好了
All right

197
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:47,074
你不需要为我爸打工的 Des
You know you don't really need a job from my father, Des.

198
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:49,075
那和工作无关
It's not about the job.

199
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,091
我想让他尊重我
I want him to respect me.

200
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:54,041
他会尊重你的
Then respect you he shall.

201
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,044
但如果是他太愚蠢而忽略了你的才华
But if for some reason he's too daft to see how brilliant you are,

202
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:01,022
那也不是世界末日
it's not the end of the world.

203
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:04,082
你刚才说什么?
What did you say?

204
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:23,014
给你的 甜心
Here you go, luv.

205
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,054
你还好吗?
You all right?

206
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:26,045
是的 我没事
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

207
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:33,032
只是有点"情景重现"罢了
Just had a bit of a d嶴?vu, that's all.

208
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:45,032

什么?
Excuse me.

215
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:02,000
你刚才说什么?
What did you say?

216
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,087
我说"给815的快递"
I said, "delivery for 8-15".

217
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:15,045
Hume先生 Widmore先生可以见你了

219
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:27,069
Penny 没告诉我你以前是个演员 Desmond
Penny didn't tell me you were an actor, Desmond.

No, it's actually set design for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

221
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,049

Impressive.

222
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,060
你大学没有毕业?
You didn't graduate from university.

223
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,028

行政部门有没有位置给你

234

不是什么好差事...但这也是个起步
Not the most glamorous duty, but it's a start.

他是一位受尊敬的 皇家海军上将

和你分享简直就是在浪费

257
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,028
也会让创造它的人蒙羞 因为你
and a disgrace to the great man who made it, because you,

258
00:17:58,028 --> 00:18:03,063
Hume 永远不会成为一个伟大的人

Widmore先生...我知道我不--

你只是不配喝我的威士忌

Today... This happened today. This...

288
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,096
我记得他说我没用
I remember that he said I wasn't worthy,

289
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:21,059
我很失望 我脱下我的领带
and then I came down and I took off my tie,

290
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,075
然后把它扔掉了 Penny 问我"领带去哪了?"
and then I lost my tie, and Penny said, "where was it"?

291
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:28,032
然后天开始下雨了
And then it started to rain!

292
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:44,039
山鴐(一种鸟)有不可预见的能力
Your thesis is a bit neat. The wild card, Partridge,is unpredictability.

293
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,017
把实验作十次 你就会发现不同之处了
Run the same test ten times, you’ll get ten different outcomes.

294
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:48,041
生命是如此奇妙--
That's what makes life so wonderfully--

295
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,095
Donovan!这种情况
Donovan! Case in point.

296
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:56,020
谁会料到一个浑身湿透的男人 出现在大厅里?
Who could have known that a drenched Scotsman would appear in this rotunda?

297
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,068
你看起来不错 Des 但--
You've looked better. Not much, but...

298
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:59,056
我想问你些事
I need to ask you something.

299
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:01,098
可以啊
By all means, do.

300
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:06,001
你知道时间旅行吗?
What do you know about time travel?

301
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:19,052
你疯了吗?
Are you bloody insane?

302
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:21,030
你只要告诉我有没有这种可能 
Just tell me if it's possible.

303
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,047
哪部分?
Which part?

304
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,025
一座有许多舱门的岛屿
The island full of mysterious hatches,

305
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:26,069
还有那台能够拯救世界的电脑?
or the computer which keeps the world from ending?

306
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:28,008
不
No

307
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:29,092
忘了我们是最好的朋友
Forget you're my best mate, all right?

308
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:34,051
作为一个物理学家 有没有可能 我去到从前
As a physicist, is it possible that I've somehow managed to go back in time

309
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:40,072
现在又回到现实生活了?
And am now living my life over again?

310
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,097
这不是开玩笑 Donovan
It's not funny, Donovan.

311
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:45,036
Penny的父亲训斥你不会有出息
Penny's father berates you for not being a great man,

312
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:49,009
你就预见未来你去按那个 拯救世界的按钮?
and viol? You’ve dreamed a future where you push a button to save the world.

313
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,049
那些都是真的 兄弟
These things are not in my head,brother.

314
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,078
我记起来了
I remember things.

315
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:58,003
好吧
All right, then.

316
00:21:58,003 --> 00:21:59,099
那接下来会发生什么?
What happens next?

317
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:02,024
不是这样的
It doesn't work like that.

318
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:05,058
我记不得所有事 只是...
I don't remember everything, just...

319
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:07,062
零星的片段
just bits and pieces.

320
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:11,077
那还真巧
How wonderfully convenient.

321
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:23,012
我记得这个
I remember this.

322
00:22:23,012 --> 00:22:26,030
我知道这首歌
I know this song.

323
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,068
那个点唱机...
The jukebox...

324
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:33,051
Des 我开始担心你了
Des, you're worrying me now.

325
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,091
我记得这个夜晚
I remember this night.

326
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:38,072
gray bridge在两球落后比赛只剩2分钟的情况下
Graybridge comes back from two goals down in the final two minutes

327
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,080
最后反败为胜
to win this game.

328
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,010
真是个奇迹!
It's a bloody miracle!

329
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,049
然后 Jimmy Lennon 从那扇门走进来
Jimmy Lennon's goanna come through that door

330
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:47,055
用板球棍打伤了酒保的头
and hit the bartender right in the head with a cricket bat,

331
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,029
因为他欠了他钱
'cause he owes him money.

332
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,048
- 说实在的 Des--
- Seriously, Des-

333
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,010
看好了
Just watch.

334
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:56,011
现在他要进球了
He'll score the first goal right now.

335
00:22:57,064 --> 00:23:00,074
哦!完美的扑救...
Brilliant save by...

336
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:03,014
不不--他们卷土重来
They came back.

337
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,080
他们--他们赢了
They--they won.

338
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,057
Jimmy lennon和板球棍
Jimmy Lennon, cricket bat.

339
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:21,045
根本没什么时间旅行 Des
There's no such thing as time travel, Des.

340
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:30,076
据我所知 真爱难求
And from what I understand, true love can be just as unlikely.

341
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:38,068
如果你真的爱 Penny  就马上和她结婚
So, if you love Penny, stop messing about and marry her.

342
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:17,036
你闻起来像去过酒吧
You smell like the pub.

343
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:21,084
那是因为我刚从那里回来
That's because I was at the pub.

344
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:23,048
你没有得到工作?
You didn't get the job.

345
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:25,097
是的
yes

346
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:28,077
我父亲对你说了什么?
What did my father say?

347
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:33,040
你父亲...很可爱
Your father... was lovely.

348
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,050
对于我没有资格的问题上 我们达成了共识
We just both agreed that I wasn't exactly qualified.

349
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,008
我说我们来庆祝
I say we celebrate.

350
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:44,036
庆祝命运褪去了你痛苦的存在
I say we celebrate that fate has spared you a miserable existence

351
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:47,014
于 widmore 公司里
under the employ of Widmore industries.

352
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:48,025
明天让我带你出去吧
Let me take you out tomorrow.

353
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:50,055
我们去长提的龙虾馆 我请客
Let's go for lobsters on the pier, my treat.

354
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:54,088
我们不应该庆祝 因为你父亲不喜欢我 
I don't think my failure to impress your father is any occasion to celebrate.

355
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:59,005
但是我爱你
Well, the occasion is I love you.

356
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:04,072
为什么?
Why?

357
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:07,078
你为什么爱我?
Why do you love me?

358
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:11,008
因为你是个好人
'Cause you're a good man.

359
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:15,085
这就是我爱你的原因
In my experience, they’re pretty hard to come by.

360
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:28,084
嘿 Des?
Hei, Des?

361
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:32,061
你在哪?
Where are you?

362
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:36,079
我就在你身边
I'm right here.

363
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:51,003
第一次做这事吧?
Never done this before, have you?

364
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:53,038
那还不明显吗?
Is it that obvious?

365
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,013
我一向能看出来的
I can always tell the first-timers.

366
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:02,001
你能告诉我你的心理价位吗?
Now then, may I ask your price range?

367
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,028
我不是那种吝啬的人
I'm not a man of means.

368
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:06,033
我希望 有一天...
I hope to, you know, one day...

369
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:10,063
我正好有你想要的东西
I have just the thing.

370
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:23,087
这不会弄瞎女王的双眼
This won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still,

371
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:27,087
但那仍是生命之光
it has the sparkle of life.

372
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:36,055
我就要这个了
I'll take it.

373
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:37,080
我...抱歉?
I'm... sorry?

374
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,099
这个很完美 我买下了
It's perfect. I'll take it.

375
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:43,029
不 你不会的
No, you won't.

376
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:46,093
把戒指还给我
Give me the ring. Give it here.

377
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:49,095
我不明白
I don't understand.

378
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:50,071
这是不对的
This is wrong.

379
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:51,072
你没买下这枚钻戒
You don't buy the ring.

380
00:26:51,072 --> 00:26:53,044
你犹豫了
You--you have second thoughts.

381
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,026
你从那扇门走出去了
You walk right out that door.

382
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:58,067
所以还是还给我吧
So come on. Let's have it.

383
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,012
我不知道你是怎么了
I don't know what you're on about.

384
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:05,084
你没买这枚戒指 Desmond
You don't buy the ring, Desmond.

385
00:27:08,004 --> 00:27:09,034
你怎么知道我的名字?
How do you know my name?

386
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:13,016
我不仅知道你的名字 还知道你没有向Penny求婚
I know your name as well as I know that you don't ask Penny to marry you.

387
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:15,008
事实上 你伤了她的心
In fact, you break her heart.

388
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,052
当然...
Well, breaking her heart, of course,

389
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:19,053
这驱使你几年后
is what drives you in a few short years from now

390
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:22,064
参加那个航海来证明她父亲是错的
to enter that sailing race to prove her father wrong,

391
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:25,084
然后来到了那个岛上
which brings you to the island

392
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:29,017
花了三年来输入那些数字
where you spend the next three years

393
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:35,009
直到你被迫转动了那个应急钥匙
of your life entering numbers into the computer, until
 you are forced to turn that fail-safe key.

394
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:40,035
如果你没做那些事的话 Desmond David Hume
And if you don't do those things,Desmond David Hume,

395
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:45,042
我们都会死的
every single one of us is dead.

396
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:51,063
所以还是把戒指还给我
So give me that sodding ring.

397
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:02,077
我知道这对你很难
You're going to be difficult about this, I can see.

398
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:05,068
你是谁?
Who are you?

399
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:09,064
你喜欢栗子吗?
Do you like chestnuts?

400
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:12,021
什么?
What?

401
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:15,098
谢谢
Thank you.

402
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:25,033
那个男人穿了双红色的鞋子
That man over there is wearing red shoes.

403
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,036
那又怎么样?
So? What, then?

404
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:34,081
只是想说他不怎么赶时髦
Just thought it was a bold fashion choice worth noting.

405
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:40,090
这些都不真的 是吗?
This isn't really happening, is it?

406
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,062
什么?
Sorry?

407
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:49,023
我有过脑震荡
I've had a concussion.

408
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:52,071
你是我的潜意识
You're my subconscious.

409
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:54,084
是吗?
Am I?

410
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:56,061
你来这是...
You're here to...

411
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:59,096
让我别向Penny求婚
to talk me out of marrying Penny.

412
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:02,054
那不会管用的
Well, it won't bloody work.

413
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:04,016
不 你错了
Oh, yes, it will.

414
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,050
不
No

415
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,027
那里没什么岛
There is no island.

416
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,085
没什么按钮
There is no button.

417
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:09,061
那太疯狂了
It's madness.

418
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:11,087
我爱她 她也爱我
I love her. She loves me.

419
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:16,002
我想和她度过余生
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with her.

420
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:17,098
不 Desmond...
No, Desmond...

421
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:21,047
你不会的
You won’t.

422
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:29,097
哦 我的天
Oh,My God

423
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:36,047
你知道这会发生的 是吗?
You knew that was gonna happen, didn’t you?

424
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:40,083
为什么什么也不做?
Why didn't you do anything?

425
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:44,083
因为我不能改变一切
Because it wouldn't matter.

426
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:51,024
我告诉他那个脚手架 明天他还是会被出租车撞死
Had I warned him about the scaffolding, tomorrow he'd be hit by a taxi.

427
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:57,003
如果我警告他那个出租车 后天他在洗澡时滑倒摔断了脖子
If I warned him about the taxi, he'd fall in the shower and break his neck.

428
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,061
这个宇宙 很不幸 有某种...
The universe, unfortunately,has a way of...

429
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:04,067
流动的联系
course-correcting.

430
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:07,054
那个男人注定要死的
That man was supposed to die.

431
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:11,045
这是他的路
That was his path.

432
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,021
你的路就是在那座岛上
Just as it's your path to go to the island.

433
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:22,018
你这样做是没有选择的 Desmond
You don't do it because you choose to, Desmond,

434
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:27,033
你原本就应该这样做
you do it because you're supposed to.

435
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:32,073
一小时后我要和 Penny 见面
I'm gonna meet Penny in an hour.

436
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:35,014
我要向她求婚
I've got the ring.

437
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:37,039
她会答应的
She'll say yes.

438
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,059
我可以选择我的路
I can choose whatever I want.

439
00:30:42,094 --> 00:30:46,006
你不一定喜欢你的那条路 Desmond
You may not like your path, Desmond,

440
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:55,013
但按那个按钮才是真理
but pushing that button is the only truly great thing that you will ever do.

441
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:07,001
我要付你多少钱?
How much for the ring?

442
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,085
- 嗨! - 嘿

443
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:59,075
- 我迟到了吗? - 你来的正好
- Am I late?- Right on time.

444
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:01,057
可爱的恋人 拍张照吧?
Take your photo, lovebirds?

445
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:02,074
不 谢谢了 朋友
No, thanks, mate.

446
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:05,036
你们总要那些给孙子看的
Come on, something to show the grandkids.

447
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:07,035
来吧 Des 拍给我们的孙子看
Come on, Des, let's do it for all those grandkids.

448
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,036
是吗? 要拍吗?
You'll do it?

449
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:09,084
好吧
All right.

450
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:12,051
让我看看什么适合你们?
Let's see what we got for you here, eh?

451
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:14,062
- 啊 美丽的沙漠 - 不
Ah, a beautiful desert scene.

452
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,046
不是沙漠? 好吧
No, not the desert? All right.

453
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:18,010
啊 我知道了 森林吧
I know. The Alps.

454
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,061
啊 我喜欢这森林
I love the Alps.

455
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:20,067
哦 我讨厌这个
I hate the Alps.

456
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:23,003
是啊 也不是森林
Yeah, not the alps.

457
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:25,085
这张行了吧 迷人的marina景色
Here we go. Beautiful marina scene.

458
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:29,032
- 我们拍这幅吧 - 就是这幅没错吧?
- Yeah, let's do that.- It's the one, isn't it?

459
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,046
好了
All right.

460
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,053
- 把上衣脱掉 - 你们站好位置了!
Take your coat off. It’s boiling.

461
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:34,033
这样不错 还有棕树
There's palm trees.

462
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,017
好 准备
Here we go.

463
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:39,059
1,2...
one,two…

464
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,046
哦 真是经典
An instant classic.

465
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:46,040
- 只要5英镑 - 给你 亲爱的
- Only 5 quid.- Here we go, luv.

466
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,036
这是你的 朋友
Here you go, mate.

467
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:51,013
找你20
Out of 20.

468
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:57,095
小价钱换来欢乐的记忆
You're a lovely couple. Small price to pay for the memories, right?

469
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,057
我不能走过去
I couldn't go through with it.

470
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:13,043
什么?
What was that?

471
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,004
我不能这样做
I can't do this.

472
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:18,019
你不能做什么?
You can't do what?

473
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:22,039
我们
Us.

474
00:33:22,065 --> 00:33:25,014
这...
This...

475
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:29,049
这段感情
This relationship.

476
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,025
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

477
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:35,068
我怎么能? 我...
How can I?

478
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,018
我不能照顾你 我没有工作
I can't look after you. I haven't got a job.

479
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,047
我没有...
I don't have any...

480
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:46,039
我连5英镑的照相钱都付不起
I can't even afford 5quid for a bloody photograph.

481
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:48,037
你应该找到更好的
You deserve someone better.

482
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:51,024
我应该?我选择和你在一起 因为我爱你
I know what I deserve. I chose to be with you. I love you.

483
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:54,073
爱是不够的 做一个好人也是不够的
Love's not enough.Being a good man is not enough.

484
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,095
这是怎么了 Des? 这都是从哪里来的?
What's this about, Des? Where's this coming from?

485
00:33:57,095 --> 00:34:00,053
这些发生的太快了--你搬了进来
It's all happening too soon--you moving in,

486
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:03,031
你粉刷房间 改变一切
you're painting rooms, you’re changing things.

487
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,040
我甚至都不喜欢红色
I don't even like red.

488
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,075
你为什么要离开你昂贵的公寓 来和我住?--
And why would you leave your flat--your expensive flat--

489
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:09,072
别这样做
Don't do that.

490
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:13,068
别假装你不在意 别以为你能改写历史
Don't you pretend you don't care, and don't you dare rewrite history.

491
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:19,029
我离开我的公寓是因为 你住在里面变的自大了
I left my expensive flat 'cause you were too proud to live there, remember?

492
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:23,050
如果你想要我离开
If you want me to go, if you want me to leave,

493
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:31,021
不要把这个说成 我做了什么 我应该怎样...
then don't make this about what I do or don't deserve...

494
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:37,079
而体面的承认你这样做 因为你是个懦夫!
and have the decency to admit that you're doing this because you're a coward.

495
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:48,063
对不起 Pen 但这...
I'm sorry. But this...

496
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,023
我们本不应该在一起的
we're not supposed to be together.

497
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:31,062
要什么?
What'll it be?

498
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,056
呃...
en…

499
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:41,093
就给我你们店最便宜的酒
Just give me a pint of your cheapest.

500
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:43,020
我在庆祝
I'm celebratin'.

501
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,066
哦?为了什么?
What's the occasion?

502
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:54,012
我犯了人生最大的错误 最差的部分是...
I think I've made the biggest mistake of my life, and the worst part is...

503
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:56,049
我从前也犯过
I'm pretty sure I've made it before.

504
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:59,040
那就叫做"情景再现"朋友
That's what they call do?vu, mate.

505
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,017
是吗?
Do they now?

506
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:25,081
我弄错了一天
I had the wrong night.

507
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:27,069
我是对的
I was right.

508
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:30,040
我弄错了一天 我听到了歌声然后...
I was off by a night. I heard the song, and then...

509
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,075
我记起来了
I remember this.

510
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:34,032
我没疯!
I'm not crazy!

511
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:35,075
我仍然能改变一切
I can still change things.

512
00:36:35,075 --> 00:36:39,072
我仍然能改变
I can still change it.

513
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,094
Jimmy lennon
Jimmy Lennon.

514
00:36:41,094 --> 00:36:45,045
我的钱到底在哪里?
Where the hell's my money?

515
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:49,017
嘿 躲开 兄弟!
Hey, duck, brother!

521
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:23,058
让我再回去一次
Let me go back one more time.

522
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:27,091

526
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,012
你怎么知道 claire 溺水了?
How'd you know Claire was drowning?

527
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:47,043
因为我听见他求救了
Well, I could hear her calling for help.

528
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:52,042
那你也听见闪电了?
You, uh, hear the lightning as well?

529
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:56,034
你碰巧在 claire 的帐篷外面 搭了那个竿子
Just by chance, you pitched your little rod outside Claire's tent,

530
00:38:56,034 --> 00:39:00,099
2小时后 闪电就来了
and two hours later, lightning strikes.

531
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:11,009
嘿 我不知道你在做什么 但我却看到了个懦夫
I don't know how you're doing what it is you're
 doing,but I know a coward when I see one.

532
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:13,059
是啊 一个--!
Yeah, a coward--

533
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,036
你不会想知道在我转动那钥匙后 发生了什么!
You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key!

534
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:17,010
放开我!

539
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:28,019
不论你做什么
It doesn't matter what you do.

540
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,075
你到底在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

541
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:33,063
你改变不了的
You can't change it.

改变不了的
You can't change it.

543
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:40,078
不论你做什么 你还是改变不了的
No matter what you try to do, you just can't change it.

544
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:46,010
他有点疯了 我们把他带回他的帐篷去
He's wankered.Let's get him to his tent.

545
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,009

很抱歉我掐了你
Listen, I'm sorry I tried to strangle you, all right?

550
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:06,097
我们扯平了 朋友 
Fair play, mate. Here we go.

551

552
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:14,012

553
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:18,005
Desmond...

554
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:23,050
我想知道你到底发生了什么事?
You are gonna tell me what happened to you.

555
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:34,014
当我转动了那个钥匙...
When I turned that key...

556
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:39,066
我的生活...
my life...

557
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:43,035
又回到了从前
flashed before my eyes,

558
00:40:43,035 --> 00:40:46,089
然后我又回到了这丛林
and then I was back in the jungle,

559
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:50,082
还在这该死的岛上
still on this bloody island.

560
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:54,000
但那些片段 Charlie...
But those flashes, Charlie...

561
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,083
那些片段--他们 没有停下
those flashes--they didn't stop.

562
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,050
那么...
So...

563
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:04,026
你想告诉我你看见 Claire 溺水的片段了?
you're telling me you saw a flash of Claire drowning this morning?

564
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:06,012
这就是你怎么会去救她?
That's how you knew how to save her?

565
00:41:06,012 --> 00:41:10,086
我不是在救 Claire,Charlie
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.

566
