1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,035
剧情回顾...

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,046
我见到了我的亲生父亲
I met my real father.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,090
好消息  不是么?
Great news, right?

4
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:08,042
他假装很爱我  
He pretended to love me

5
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:09,080
为的就是要偷走我的肾
just long enough to steal my kidney.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,013
我昨晚一直跟着你 
I followed you last night.

7
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:13,012
那是你父亲的房子吗?
Is it your father's house?

8
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:16,010
你以后不会再去那个地方了
you're not gonna go to that place anymore.

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,010
好的
All right.

10
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:19,023
你认为
You think

11
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:22,036
你是第一个被骗的人么?
you're the first person that ever got conned?

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,040
你需要一个父亲 而我需要一个肾
You needed a father figureand I needed a kidney.

13
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:29,006
-嘿  Helen...  -你得做出选择
-Hey, Helen...  -You're gonna have to choose.

14
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,010
他还是我
Him or me.

15
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:37,050
我叫Henry Gale   我从明尼苏达来
My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota.

16
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:39,060
你画一张去你热气球那儿的地图
You draw up a map to your balloon.

17
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:40,096
我们就会去那儿找到它的
 We go out there, we find it.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,080
如果我画错了  他们会杀了我
And if I mess up, they'll crucify me.

19
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,016
你到底知不知道它在哪儿?
Do you or do you not know where it is?

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,016
我在那儿葬了我的妻子
I went back there to bury my wife.

21
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,030
是去他热气球那儿的 
It's to his balloon.

22
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:50,012
这至少要走一天
This is at least a day's walk.

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,076
那我们现在就动身  
Then we should get going.

24
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,036
他说过热气球就在这儿
This is where he said it would be.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,020
-我们得确定一下  -如果我是他们中的一个
-We need to be sure.  -If I was one of them,

26
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,020
那些你们认为是敌人的人
these people that you seem to think are your enemies,

27
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,033
那儿就不会有什么热气球了
there'd be no balloon.

28
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,078
我会画一张去一个隐秘的地方的地图
So I'd draw a map to a real secluded place.

29
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:05,096
当你们的朋友到那儿时  
And when your friends got there,

30
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,046
一群我的人就会在那儿等他们了
a bunch of my people'd be waiting for them.

31
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:13,000
还好我不是他们的一员  不是么?
I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,076
-我做了什么你要带我去郊游?  -什么?  
-So, what did I do to deserve this?  -What?

33
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,026
一个小伙子就不能带他的女朋友
Can't a fella take his girl

34
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:47,056
出去野餐吗?还得要原因?
out for a picnic lunch just 'cause?

35
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,010
"小伙子"?
"Fella"?

36
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:52,076
是的  小伙子
That's right. Fella.

37
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,073
那么  你准备带我去哪?
So, where you taking me?

38
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:59,093
我不会说的  你别问了
I'm not telling, so just quit asking.

39
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,030
没有我能帮上忙的吗?
Can I be of any help?

40
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,086
你就看讣告  喝咖啡就行了
You just read your obituaries and drink your coffee

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,076
所有的事情我来处理
and I'll take care of the everything.

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,066
别看不起讣告
Don't knock the obits;

43
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,010
这是报纸最有意思的部分
it's the nicest part of the paper.

44
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:17,080
人一旦死了就不会有人再对他说三道四
No one ever says anything mean about people once they're dead.

45
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,080
恩  在我看来
Mm. And here I am thinking

46
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,076
连环画才是报纸上最有意思的部分
the funnies are the nicest part of the paper.

47
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,063
John?

48
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,060
John  你父亲叫什么?
John, what's your father's name?

49
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:35,026
怎么了?
Why?

50
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,033
是叫Anthony么?
Is it Anthony?

51
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:39,036
Anthony Cooper

52
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,070
是的  是叫这个名字
Yes. That's right.

53
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,013
他死了
He's dead.

54
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,033
再画一遍
Draw it again,

55
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:01,060
去你热气球那儿的地图
the map to your balloon.

56
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:05,080
我在开玩笑  一个玩笑罢了
I was joking. I was making a joke.

57
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:11,036
那儿除了我的热气球就没别的了
There's nothing out there besides my balloon.

58
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,016
我只是太沮丧了
I was just frustrated.

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,000
这么说太愚蠢了
It was a stupid thing to say.

60
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:17,036
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,015
无论如何  现在太晚了 
It's too late anyway.

62
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,016
她已经走出很远了  Jack
She's already long gone, Jack.

63
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,063
那么  该做的都做了
So, what's done is done?

64
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:28,016
是的
That's right.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
把他带回武器库去
Put him back in the armory.

66
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:48,033
为什么让他对你这么说话?
Why do you let him talk to you like that?

67
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:59,013
等等  我...
Hey, wait, I...

68
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,020
闭嘴
Shut up.

69
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:05,016
John  我很抱歉
John, I'm sorry.

70
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,046
John

71
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:16,030
也许他画错了
Maybe he's wrong.

72
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,010
我们应该找找悬崖另一边
We should search the other side of the cliff.

73
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,030
我们已经找了三小时了
We've been searching for three hours.

74
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,096
热气球根本不存在  Charlie
This balloon does not exist.Charlie!

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
那么他为什么画这张地图?
Then why'd he draw the map?

76
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,093
你告诉他你会保护他的
You told him you'd protect him

77
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,093
不管找不找得到热气球
whether we found the balloon or not.

78
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,053
你又多给了他两天来拖延时间
You've given him two more days to stall,

79
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:33,036
去想怎么逃跑
to figure out how to escape.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,033
我们到此为止了
We're done.

81
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:37,000
Charlie

82
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:40,020
在这  往这边
Over here! This way!

83
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,086
Sayid

84
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,040
他说过他埋了她  是么?
He said he buried her, right?

85
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:53,070
他的妻子?
His wife?

86
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,043
为什么这里没有雨?
Why isn't it raining here?

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000

90
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:38,088
Hurley

91
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,081
你有看到Ana Lucia么?
have you seen Ana Lucia?

92
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,035
她去丛林了
She took off into the jungle

93
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:43,010
和Charlie  Sayid一起  昨天走的 
with Charlie and Sayid yesterday.

94
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,045
昨天
Yesterday.

95
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:49,008
他们有说要去哪么?
She say anything about where they were going?

96
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:50,058
那要靠猜了
Well, that would,

97
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,051
每次有人告诉我什么 我都要猜他到底是什么意思
like, assume anybody actually tells me anything.

98
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,078
也许如果我在你们圈子里 
Maybe if I were in the loop,

99
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:56,028
就能帮上点什么忙了
I could be more helpful.

100
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:59,028
根本没什么圈子  Hurley
There is no loop, Hurley.

101
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,046
打扰一下  Jack  
Excuse me, Jack.

102
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,098
他全身火热还有点焦躁不安
He's been really hot and fussy.

103
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,041
你能看一下么?
Do you mind having a look?

104
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,058
-恩  好的好的  -谢谢
-Yeah. Sure, sure.  -Thanks.

105
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:14,081
圈子  伙计  圈子
Loop, dude. Loop.

106
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,071
那个  发烧是不是全好了?
So, the fever's completely gone?

107
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,085
全好了
Completely.

108
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:20,085
你不是随便说说的吧?
You're not just saying that, right?

109
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,045
你看起来有点心烦意乱
You seem a bit distracted.

110
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,085
不  我很好  Aaron也一样
I'm fine. And so is Aaron.

111
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:28,035
谢谢
Thanks.

112
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,055
还看诊吗?
Doctor still in?

113
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,015
我在涨潮抓贝类的时候
I was grabbing for mussels in the tide pool,

114
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,035
被海胆扎了
pissed off a sea urchin.

115
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,041
看起来没感染
Well, doesn't look infected.

116
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:40,058
擦点尼奥普林就没事了
A little Neosporin wouldn't hurt.

117
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:42,041
哦  好的  尼奥普林
Yeah. Right. Neosporin.

118
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:45,075
我想现在的汇率
I think the current rate of exchange is

119
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:48,048
十件衣服才换一管药膏
ten loads of laundry for a tube.

120
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,028
是的
Right.

121
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,015
怎么回事?
What was that?

122
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,091
John?

123
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:33,095
发生什么事了?
What's the matter?

124
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,011
你确定你要这么做?
You sure you want to do this?

125
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,088
你知道  我们可以直接去野餐的
We could just go on that picnic,you know.

126
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:07,001
很快  我保证
Soon, I promise.

127
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,078
也许他把他的肾留给你了
Maybe he left you his kidney.

128
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:24,055
我们活着的人
"For we who are alive, who are left

129
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:27,055
会与他们在云端重逢
will be caught up together with them in the clouds

130
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:29,075
在空中共同会见我们的主
to meet the Lord in the air,

131
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:32,081
之后就会与主同在
and so we will live with the Lord forever. "

132
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:39,051
我们把Anthony Cooper的灵魂托付给你
We commit the soul of Anthony Cooper to you,

133
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:41,061
但是我们永远不会分开
that we shall never be separated.

134
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,000
现在  
And now

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,055
我们一起向耶稣祈祷  阿门
we are united with Christ as we go toward him. Amen.

136
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:55,028
你想说点什么么  John?
Do you wish to say anything, John?

137
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:10,008
我原谅你了
I forgive you.

138
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:29,035
John?

139
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:32,088
嘿  你在么?
Hey, you out there?

140
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,075
是什么声音?
What's that noise?

141
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,095
John?  怎么了? 说话啊
John? What's going on? Talk to me.

142
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,055
安静点好么?
Will you be quiet?

143
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,098
告诉我怎么了  到底...
Tell me what's happening. What the hell is...

144
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,098
你给我闭嘴
Will you shut up?

145
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:49,058
10... 9... 8...
Ten, nine, eight,

146
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,011
7...
seven,

147
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,065
6... 5... 4...
six, five, four,

148
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,031
也许你得叫Jack来
-Maybe you should get Jack!

149
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:56,045
3...
three,

150
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:59,038
我说了闭嘴
I said, shut up!

151
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:25,011
怎么了?
What happened?

152
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:32,088
我压四个番木瓜
I bet four papayas.

153
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,091
你不能压  我刚压了
You can't bet. I just bet.

154
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:38,031
你可以叫牌也可以加注
You can either call, or raise,

155
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:41,028
要么放弃
or lay 'em down, muttonchops.

156
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,088
别看我
Don't look at me.

157
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:47,081
放弃吧  Hurley 他牌比你大
Lay them down, Hurley. he's got you beat.

158
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:51,031
 伙计  我还有杀手锏
Dude. I've got a killer hand.

159
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:52,045
不  你没有
No, you don't.

160
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,078
你是五张顺子
You got a baby straight.

161
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:58,051
他有同花
He's got the flush.

162
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:02,065
我呢?  我有什么?
What about me? What do I got?

163
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:05,002
很难说  
Hard to say,

164
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:06,085
但你就是为了好玩
but you're just playing for the fun of it.

165
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:09,010
恩  好玩也没什么不好 
Well, fun's not bad.

166
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,061
你偶尔也应该玩玩
You should try it sometime.

167
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,071
不要加注了  Hurley
Don't call him, Hurley.

168
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,035
嘿  职业牌手
Hey, Amarillo Slim!

169
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:21,058
你在电视上看了点扑克牌玩法
You think because you watch poker on TV

170
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,035
就想同高手过招?
you can tussle with the big boys?

171
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,088
我得回舱子里了
-I've gotta head back to the hatch.

172
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,095
舱子又不会自己走掉  医生
Hatch ain't going nowhere, Doc.

173
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,031
赢几个芒果吃怎么样?
How about you put your mangoes where your mouth is?

174
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:42,031
我想我可以玩一两把
I guess I could play a hand or two.

175
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:54,015
发生什么事了?
Hey! What's going on?

176
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,038
你还在吗?
Are you still out there?

177
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,031
John  John

178
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,088
我在
I'm here.

179
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:07,097
是什么声音?  怎么回事?  
What were those noises? What's wrong?

180
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,041
没什么事
Nothing is wrong.

181
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:29,088
那么结论如何  Locke先生?
So what's the verdict, Mr. Locke?

182
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:33,088
抗震螺钉都是一等的
The seismic bolting is all first-rate,

183
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:38,031
没有长霉  没有生锈
there's no visible mold, no dry rot.

184
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:41,071
我都会写进报告里的  但是我想
It'll all be in my report,but I think

185
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:44,081
你和你丈夫是找对房子了
you and your husband got a pretty nice house here.

186
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:46,081
如果我有丈夫的话
If I had a husband,

187
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:50,048
我肯定他听到会很高兴的
I'm sure he would be happy to hear that.

188
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:53,011
你在这张发票上签个名...
If you'll just sign this invoice.

189
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,078
你好  儿子
Hello, Son.

190
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:37,025
你想要什么?
What do you want?

191
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:39,059
听着  John  
Look, John...

192
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,028
我知道我这么对你是不对的
I know what I did to you was wrong.

193
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:44,028
你偷了我的肾
You stole my kidney.

194
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,041
我当时快要死了
I was dying.

195
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:53,061
你应该先问问我的
You could have asked me.

196
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,075
你想从我这里得到什么?
What do you want from me?

197
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,005
我假装死了是因为
I killed myself off because

198
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:08,085
外面有两个人想要我的命
there are two men who were going to beat me to it.

199
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:12,045
你做了什么  偷了他们的肝?
What did you do, steal their livers?

200
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:16,045
没有  我拿了他们七十万美元
No. I took them for 700,000 dollars.

201
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,068
退休前捞一笔
Retirement con.

202
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:23,028
我把钱放在一个保险箱里
I put the money in a safe deposit box,

203
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,088
但是那两个人很可能等在银行里
but these two guys might be sitting on the bank

204
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,075
看我是否会出现
to see if I show my face,

205
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:29,085
所以我才要你
which is why I need you to go in there

206
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:33,028
去那儿帮我把钱拿来
and get it for me.

207
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,091
你认为我是傻子?
Do you think I'm stupid?

208
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:45,081
我给你二十万
I want you to take 200 grand of it.

209
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,081
这弥补不了我对你的所作所为
It won't make up for what I did to you,

210
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:53,095
但我只能做这些了
but it's the best I can do.

211
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:57,031
我会在飞机场边上的旅馆
I'll be at the Flightline Motel,

212
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,081
一直等到明天下午
near the airport, until tomorrow afternoon.

213
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:02,025
之后不管拿不拿的到钱 我都立马走人
And then I'm gone, money or no money.

214
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:06,075
还有  John 如果到那时你还没来...
And, John, if I don't see you again...

215
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:11,031
我会理解的
I'll understand.

216
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,075
我们被困住了
We're locked in.

217
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,095
什么?
What?

218
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:33,041
这些玻璃门降下来了
These blast doors came down.

219
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,092
房间被封锁了  
The whole living area is sealed off.

220
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:36,078
我出不去了
I can't get out.

221
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:39,088
你试着拉过...
Did you try to pry...

222
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,071
是的  但我不能...
Yeah, but I couldn't...

223
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:46,065
也许...
Maybe...

224
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:50,045
也许如果我们两人...
Maybe if the two of us...

225
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:52,075
你要我帮你么?
You want me to help you?

226
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,038
是的
Yeah.

227
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:03,061
如果我真的帮你把这些门打开了
And if I do help you get these doors up...

228
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,068
你又会把我关回这里  是么?
then you're gonna lock me back in here, aren't you?

229
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:12,035
是的
That's right.

230
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:19,068
那么我要你保证  John
Then I'm going to need your word, John.

231
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,021
我要你保证你不会让你们的人
I'm gonna need your word that you won't let your people

232
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:26,095
伤害我
do anything to me.

233
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:28,071
如果你说的是实话
Well, if you're who you say you are,

234
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,038
你还有什么好担心的呢?
what are you worried about?

235
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,088
他们出事了
Things have happened to them,

236
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,041
根本不关我的事
things that I had nothing to do with.

237
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:36,085
但是除了我他们找不到人来出气
But they've got no one to blame,except for me.

238
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,091
气都撒到我头上了
So, I'm gonna need your word...

239
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:44,075
所以我要你保证你会保护我
that you'll protect me.

240
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:46,098
无论发生什么事
No matter what.

241
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,001
你是谁?
Who are you?

242
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:16,068
我叫Henry Gale 我来自明尼苏达...
My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota...

243
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:21,011
我和你一样坠落在这个岛上
And I crashed on this island just like you.

244
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:29,008
好吧  我保证
All right. You have my word.

245
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:38,055
伙计  你赢了
Dude, you got me.

246
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,065
我不玩了
I'm out.

247
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,032
你知道我的牌么  医生?
Think you're in my head, Doc?

248
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:48,089
还有三个木瓜  叫牌还是认输
You've still got three papayas. Call or fold.

249
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:51,065
看来你有麻烦了  高手
Well, you're in trouble now, Cool Hand.

250
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:54,052
一对Q  这样就有三个了
Pocket Queens makes me a set.

251
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:03,099
-三个K  -喔  伙计
-Kings wired.  -Oh dube.

252
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,069
但至少我不知道你的牌
But at least I'm not in your head.

253
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,005
那么  就这样吧
Well, I guess that's it.

254
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,049
什么意思  就这样?
What do you mean, "it"?

255
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,069
Sawyer  你输光了
Sawyer, you're busted.

256
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,075
我全赢了  再让你去摘芒果
I got it all. Wouldn't be fair for you

257
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,032
我都有些过意不去了
to go and pick more mangoes.

258
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,005
我有更多的芒果
Well, I got a hell of a lot more than mangoes.

259
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:26,062
你还想要什么下注?  随便说
You wanna play real stakes? Name 'em.

260
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:29,022
这里已经有一堆了  伙计
It's a pile of fruit, man.

261
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,042
我要把它们赢回来
And I want it back.

262
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,029
要不要我去找个裁判来?
Should I go and get a ruler?

263
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:38,052
就到这里吧  胖子 干吗不去弄点吃的?
Fun time's over, Mongo. Why not hit the buffet?

264
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:40,019
-可我还想...  -好了  Hurley
-But, I wanna...  -Come on. Hurley.

265
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:42,099
我们走  让这些孩子自己玩吧
Let's go. Leave these boys to their sandbox.

266
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,039
再来一把  医生
One more hand, Doc.

267
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,085
赌什么?
What's it gonna take?

268
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:55,035
你从武器库偷的药品
The medicine you stole from the armory.

269
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,049
所有的
All of it.

270
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:13,069
准备好了吗? 1 2 3
Ready? One, two, three.

271
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:27,015
加油
Let's go.

272
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,059
用力些
Harder!

273
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:39,080
工具箱  把工具箱拿来  我撑着 
The tool box! Get the tool box. I'll hold it.

274
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,015
你可以吗?
You sure?

275
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,079
快去
Get it!

276
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:46,042
快  快点  放到下面去
Come on! Come on! Put it under!

277
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:11,002
John  等等  你不觉得...
John, wait. Don't you think...

278
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,085
让门停下来
You have to stop the door.

279
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,015
找点其它的东西垫在下面
Put something else under the door!

280
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,079
快
Come on, come on!

281
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:27,042
堆起来  堆起来
Stack 'em, stack 'em.

282
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,022
我被压得不行了
You have to stop the pressure.

283
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:34,022
天那  快  快
Come on, come on, come on!

我拉你出来  来吧
Let's get you out, come on.

286
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,069
不不不  停下
No! No! Stop!

287
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:46,002
停下  停下  停下
Stop! Stop! Stop!

288
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,045
好吧  我们等人来  好么?
All right, we'll wait until somebody comes down. All right?

289
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:54,035
只是时间问题
It's only a matter of time.

290
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,045
是么?
Yeah?

291
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,085
不  我们没时间了
No, we don't have time.

292
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:44,025
亲爱的...
Honey.

293
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,005
穿上你最好的衣服
Put on your Sunday best.

294
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:49,035
我带你去野餐...
I'm taking you out to paint...

295
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,049
John  我们有客人
John... We have visitors.

296
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:59,002
呃  这些人说他们认识你的父亲
Um... These men say they knew your father.

297
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:04,059
John  我是Jimmy Bane
Hi, John, I'm Jimmy Bane.

298
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:06,059
我想Helen告诉过你我...

299
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:08,075
-我和他不是很熟  -她是这么说的
-I didn't really know him.  -She told me.

300
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,089
但我还是想问你几个问题
But I'd like to ask you a couple questions,

301
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,075
如果你不介意的话
if that's OK?

302
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,075
好  当然
Sure. Of course.

303
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,063
在你父亲死后你有见到过他么  
Have you seen your father since he died,

304
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:19,032
Locke先生?
Mr. Locke?

305
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:22,015
我怎么可能...
How... Have I?

306
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,053
呃  我们在想他可能没有死
Well, we were thinking possibly he's not dead.

307
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:25,084
你也许也知道  
And maybe you know that.

308
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:28,015
我是说  作为儿子  
I mean, for his son,

309
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,045
你在他的葬礼上并没有太痛苦
you didn't look too shook up at his funeral.

310
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,012
你怎么敢这么说?
How dare you?

311
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:36,001
如果你知道那个男人是怎么对他的
If you had any idea what that man did to him,

312
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:37,006
那个狗娘养的... ...
what that son of a bitch...

313
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:39,035
嘿  Helen
Hey, Helen.

314
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,069
我们是去送他的
We were there to get past him,

315
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:45,032
让他走  我们好开始自己的生活
to get on with our lives, to let him go.

316
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:50,005
好的  好的
OK, OK.

317
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,015
我们走前再问一件事
Just one thing before we go.

318
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,019
你的包里是什么  John?
What's in the bag, John?

319
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:04,045
工作文件之类的  我是个房屋勘探员
Work papers and stuff, I'm a home inspector.

320
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:08,065
介意我看一下么?
You mind if we take a look?

321
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,025
恩...
Well...

322
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:35,049
就这样吧
There you go.

323
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:40,052
谢谢你的咖啡  小姐
Thanks for the coffee, miss.

324
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:00,039
Helen  我很抱歉  你没事吧?
Helen, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

325
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:04,055
你是在骗他们么  John?
Were you lying to those men, John?

326
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:08,085
没有  我当时很害怕
No, I was scared.

327
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,069
我只是...
I was...

328
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:13,082
我只是很害怕
I was scared.

329
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:30,069
那么  你是在哪儿学的牌  医生?
So, where'd you learn to play cards, Doc?

330
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:34,065
埔开
Phuket.

331
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:37,009
你去泰国干吗?
What the hell were you doing in Thailand?

332
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:42,049
怎么  你以为我不知道埔开在哪儿么?
What, you don't think I know where Phuket is?

333
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:45,029
我是初中没有毕业
Just 'cause I dropped out of ninth grade

334
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:48,012
可我不是傻子
don't make me an idiot.

335
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,045
在远东吧  是么?
Far East, huh?

336
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,075
看不出来你是出过远门的人
I wouldn't have taken you for a world traveler.

337
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:54,085
你在那儿刺的文身吗?
That where you got the art on your shoulder?

338
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:59,009
你再发一次牌吧?
How about you deal again?

339
00:25:59,012 --> 00:26:00,069
什么?
What?

340
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:05,015
这次在桌面上发
This time from the top of the deck.

341
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:10,035
哦  我只是想试一下
Well, I had to try.

342
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,075
那个是用来干嘛的?
What does it do?

343
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,042
我们还不清楚
We're not exactly sure.

344
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:26,012
你们每隔...
And you push it...

345
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:28,052
108分钟就按一次按钮  是的
Every 108 minutes, yeah.

346
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:30,049
警报还有多久开始响?
How soon does this alarm go off?

347
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:33,019
很快  所以我要你
Very... Which is why I need you to go up

348
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:35,022
从格栅爬进通风口
through the grate and into the vents.

349
00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:36,092
格栅上锁了  我试过的
Grate's bolted shut. I tried.

350
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,095
是的  食品室还有一个格栅
Yeah. There's another grate in the pantry.

351
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,082
你可以从那里出去
Get through there.

352
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:43,009
从通风口爬去屋顶
Take the vent into the dome.

353
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:45,055
也许我们可以等...
Maybe we should wait for...

354
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:48,059
我们不能等了  警报随时会响
We can't. It'll go off any minutes.

355
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:52,089
我相信你了  Henry  现在你得相信我
I trusted you, Henry. Now you gotta trust me.

356
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:54,089
按键一定要按
That button has to be pushed.

357
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:57,099
好的  我该怎么做?
OK. What do I do?

358
00:26:58,002 --> 00:26:59,023
一旦你到那儿  
Once you're inside,

359
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,055
会听到警报声
you'll hear the alarm beeping.

360
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:04,079
然后你就得输入密码
And you just have to enter the numbers:

361
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:07,029
4  8...

362
00:27:07,032 --> 00:27:10,069
15  16  23  42

363
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:12,069
然后按执行键
And then you press "execute. "

364
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:16,002
密码一定要按顺序输  不能错
Exactly those numbers in exactly that order.

365
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:19,069
4  8  15  16  23  42

366
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:21,032
我记住了
I got it.

367
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:23,002
快去
Go.

368
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:28,095
你能够到么?
Can you reach it?

369
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:30,049
可以吧
I think so.

370
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:46,069
当心
Be careful.

371
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:52,082
Henry

372
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,095
Henry

373
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:15,022
怎么了?
What's going on?

374
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:18,052
Jack和Sawyer终于要开始一决胜负了
Jack and Sawyer are finally gonna beat each other up.

375
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:22,012
十个芒果
Ten mangoes.

376
00:28:22,015 --> 00:28:27,005
好吧  我用阿司匹林跟你的牌
OK. I'll call you with the aspirin,

377
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,059
再加一瓶羟氨苄青霉素
and raise you a bottle of Amoxicillin.

378
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:32,075
你知道羟氨苄青霉素是什么吗?
Do you even know what Amoxicillin is?

379
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,038
你可能去过埔开  医生 
You may have been to Phuket, Doc,

380
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:37,052
但我去过塔拉哈西
but I been to Tallahassee.

381
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,055
看来什么东西热起来了
Let's just say something was burning

382
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,055
这可不是因为阳光的原因
and it wasn't from the sunshine.

383
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:51,015
我全压了
I'm all in.

384
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:55,019
看来你是想让我放弃
Well, that's the move of a man who wants me to lay it down.

385
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:57,052
你是不会放弃的
You're not gonna lay it down.

386
00:28:57,055 --> 00:29:01,029
我不会?  为什么不会?
I'm not, huh?  Why's that?

387
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:04,055
因为现在有一帮人在看我们
Because there's a bunch of people watching us right now.

388
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:10,005
你不想让他们看到你再输
and you don't want them to see you lose.

389
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:20,012
恩  好的  我跟了
Well, all right. I call.

390
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:21,085
你有什么?
What you got?

391
00:29:25,075 --> 00:29:27,055
对九?  
A pair of nines?

392
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:29,095
一对九你就全压了?
You pushed in with a pair of nines?

393
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:33,059
好了  看看你的吧
You caught me. Let's see 'em.

394
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:40,039
正好压住你  不是么?
Guess it was enough, huh?

395
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,089
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

396
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:46,032
我过会儿去拿药
I'll come get the meds later.

397
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:52,042
当我问你你要赌什么时
When I asked you what you wanted for stakes,

398
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:54,062
你为什么不说要赌枪?
why didn't you ask for the guns?

399
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,022
当我要枪的时候...
When I need the guns...

400
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:04,019
我就会拿到枪的
I'll get the guns.

401
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,032
Henry?

402
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:15,042
起来  真该死
Get up, damn it!

403
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,032
Henry

404
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:24,004
Henry  你没事吧?
Henry, are you all right?

405
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:25,069
怎么了?
What happened?

406
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:29,019
听我说  你必须爬到通风口
Listen to me, you have to get up into the vents

407
00:30:29,022 --> 00:30:31,069
去那边把数字输入电脑
and enter the numbers in the computer.

408
00:30:31,072 --> 00:30:33,079
我有多久...
How long was I...

409
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,042
拜托  你要抓紧
Please! Go right now.

410
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,049
我们快没时间了
We're running out of time.

411
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:39,092
好的  好的
OK. Yeah.

412
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:41,072
当心点
Be careful!

413
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:59,049
Henry?

414
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:06,082
Henry  听得到么
Henry, can you hear me?

415
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:20,042
Henry

416
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:26,039
Henry

417
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:45,022
来了  是谁?
Yeah, who is it?

418
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:47,022
是我  John
It's John.

419
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:55,079
我能进来么?
Can I come in?

420
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:58,032
当然
Yeah, of course.

421
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:07,075
有问题么?
Any problems?

422
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,015
没有
No.

423
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:16,035
你的朋友  在我葬礼上的那个  她叫什么?
Your date at my funeral, she got a name?

424
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,085
Helen

425
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:23,092
真是个好名字  长得也很漂亮
That's a nice name. Pretty girl, too.

426
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:27,059
我  呃...
I'm...

427
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:30,092
我准备向她求婚
I'm going to ask her to marry me.

428
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:33,025
就今晚
Tonight, actually.

429
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:35,092
恩  祝你好运

431
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:42,022
恩  谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

432
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:47,095
你的那份  足够你安排一个美妙的蜜月了
Your share. Should buy you a nice honeymoon.

433
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:51,045
我不是为钱才这么做的
I didn't do this for the money.

434
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:56,009
那你为什么这么做?
Then why did you do it?

435
00:33:02,032 --> 00:33:04,032
呃... 好吧
Well... All right.

436
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:07,059
呃... 我的飞机  出租车在等我
My plane... I got a cab waiting.

437
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:12,065
如果你不想要这些钱
If you don't want the cash,

438
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:15,069
这儿的服务员的小费可就多了
the maid's gonna get a hell of a tip.

439
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:22,092
再见  John
Bye, John.

440
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:36,099
你就是他爸?
Are you him?

441
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:38,052
听我说  亲爱的...
Listen, sweetheart, I...

442
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,065
你怎么能这样?
How could you?

443
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:44,029
你怎么能这么对他?
How could you do this to him?

444
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,095
我们已经忘了这些了
We were moving past this!

445
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:01,005
Helen  等等
Helen, wait.

446
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:03,052
Helen  等等  你不明白
Helen, wait. You don't understand.

447
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:05,052
我正准备告诉你一切
I was gonna tell you.

448
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:07,052
-你骗了我  -不  等等  我能解释
-You lied.  -I can explain.

449
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:11,032
你当面向我说谎
and you lied to me.

450
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:12,099
-你已经做了选择  John  -不 
-You've made your choice, John.  -No

451
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:15,025
比起我来你更需要他的爱
You need his love more than mine.

452
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:17,099
不  我的选择是你  我正要...
No! My choice is you. I was gonna...

453
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:22,019
我爱你  我...
I love you. I...

454
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:24,022
不  等等  求你了  等等  Helen
No, no, please, please. Please, Helen...

455
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:25,089
拜托  我爱你
Please. I love you

456
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:28,059
而且  我想和你共度余生
and I want to spend my life with you

457
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:32,062
我不能没有你  Helen
and I can't live without you, Helen.

458
00:34:32,065 --> 00:34:35,009
所以...
So, will...

459
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:41,015
所以...
So...

460
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,012
你愿意嫁给我么?
Will you marry me?

461
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:09,035
Helen

462
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,012
Henry

463
00:35:44,065 --> 00:35:47,082
Henry

464
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:55,049
Henry

465
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,085
Henry...

466
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:04,052
说话啊
Please say something.

467
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,099
Henry

468
00:37:06,045 --> 00:37:08,002
Henry

469
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:15,019
有人么?
Anybody here?

470
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:21,009
有人么?
Is anybody here?

471
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:22,072
Henry

472
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,049
你回来了
You came back.

473
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:40,025
怎么  你以为我就把你一人留在这?
What, did you think I was gonna leave you here?

474
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:42,092
来吧
Come on.

475
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:45,005
你可以站起来么?
Can you stand?

476
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:49,012
我不能...
I don't...

477
00:37:49,015 --> 00:37:50,062
我想可以
I think so.

478
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:08,082
谢谢  Henry
Thank you, Henry.

479
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:11,002
谢谢你没离开我
Thank you for not leaving me.

480
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:14,042
不客气  John
You're welcome, John.

481
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:27,054
嘿  嘿  Jack  等等
Hey. Hey, Jack. Wait up.

482
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:29,081
你要回舱子里去?
You heading back to the hatch?

483
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:31,018
是的
Yeah.

484
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:33,025
我可以一起去么?  
Mind if I join?

485
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:34,089
我很久没洗澡了
It's been a while since I had a shower

486
00:38:35,004 --> 00:38:36,064
我希望...
and I was just hoping that...

487
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:38,084
事实上  水管出了点问题
Actually, the plumbing's busted.

488
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:42,004
-坏了?  -是啊  水里都是泥
-Busted?  -The water's been running muddy.

489
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:44,061
我想有根管子破了
I guess we got a cracked pipe,

490
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:46,061
但是要找到原因还得再过一段时间
but it's gonna take some time to find it.

491
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,074
哦  这样啊  我想这么多路我是白走了
Oh. Well, I guess I wasted a trip then.

492
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,061
那么  一旦我处理好
Well, I'll let you know as soon as

493
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:55,008
我尽快告诉你
we get things worked out down there.

494
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:56,088
好的
OK.

495
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:02,024
很高兴你打败了Sawyer
I'm glad you beat Sawyer.

496
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,028
你知道么?  我可以明早再去舱子里
You know what? The hatch can wait until morning

497
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:13,061
不如陪你回海滩吧
if you'd like me to walk you back to the beach.

498
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:22,081
你看见了么?
Do you see that?

499
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:25,064
是的
Yeah.

500
00:39:41,098 --> 00:39:44,094
一个降落伞
It's a parachute.

501
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,051
等等
Wait.

502
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:59,014
是食物
It's food.

503
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:12,064
那到底是什么?
What the bloody hell is that?

504
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:20,023
你们找到了什么?
What did you find?

505
00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:26,058
-我抓稳你了  -慢点  慢点
-I gotcha.  -Easy, easy.

506
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,004
抱歉
Sorry.

507
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:44,004
你怎么...你怎么做到的
What did you do...what did you do to end it

508
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,031
怎么把门弄上去的?
and make the doors go up?

509
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:48,031
我就做了你跟我说的
I did what you told me to.

510
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,017
我输入了数字  
I punched in the code

511
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,031
按了执行键
and I pressed the "execute" button,

512
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,094
但什么事都没发生
but nothing happened

513
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:55,011
那个钟却倒了回去
other than that clock flipping back.

514
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:57,008
我正要爬回通风口
I was just climbing back into the vent

515
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:58,094
灯全灭了
when the lights went out.

516
00:40:58,098 --> 00:41:02,058
十秒钟后  门就开了
Ten seconds later the doors went up.

517
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:04,078
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

518
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:08,088
你的意思是这都是巧合?
You think it was all just random?

519
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:13,011
别问我  这是你们的舱子
Don't look at me. It's your hatch.

520
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:16,024
离他远点
Get away from him.

521
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:17,084
等等  你不知道...
Wait, you don't...

522
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:20,044
-给我退后  -Sayid  没事的
-Step back, right now.  -Sayid, it's OK.

523
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:22,050
我说了  后退  
I said, get away!

524
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,011
没事的  是我放他出来的
It's all right. I let him out.

525
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:27,008
这儿发生了很多事
There was some kind of lockdown or something.

526
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:28,011
他...他在帮我
He...He was helping me.

527
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,037
你没找到我的热气球么?
Couldn't you find my balloon?

528
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:35,094
是的  我们找到了
Yeah. We found it.

529
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:38,014
我们找到了你的热气球 Henry Gale
We did find your balloon, Henry Gale.

530
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:41,004
就像你所描述的一样
Exactly how you described it.

531
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:44,084
我们也找到了你说的坟墓
We also found the grave you described.

532
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:46,084
你妻子的坟
Your wife's grave.

533
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:50,078
你说的你徒手挖的坟墓
The grave you said you dug with your own bare hands.

534
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:53,088
全都在
It was all there.

535
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:56,030
你的整个故事  你的托辞...
Your whole story. Your alibi...

536
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,074
都是真的
It was true.

537
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:03,091
但是我还是不相信那是真的
But still I did not believe it to be true.

538
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:05,091
所以我挖开了坟墓
So, I dug up that grave.

539
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:11,086
我发现里面不是个女人
and found that there was not a woman inside,

540
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:13,021
而是一个男人
there was a man.

541
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,028
一个叫Henry Gale的男人
A man named Henry Gale.

542
