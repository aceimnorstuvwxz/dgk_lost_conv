3
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:51,041
帮我找封信好么...是留着等我来取的
I'm expecting a letter."Hold for guest arrival."

4
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:55,033
-好的  你叫什么?  -Joan Hart
-Sure. What's your name?  -Joan Hart.

5
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:59,076
Joan Hart

6
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:41,058
白金版
Platinum.

7
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:45,018
白金版?
Platinum?

8
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,068
就像白金版唱片一样
As in platinum record.

9
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,084
就是有百万销量的那种
As in a million units sold.

10
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:55,056
现在  当大家知道我在空难中死了以后
Now, Drive Shaft's albums must've...

11
00:02:55,057 --> 00:03:00,086
主动轴乐队的专辑大概就会滞销了
...spiked when everybody found out that I died in some catastrophic plane disaster.

12
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:03,010
但是当我活着...
But when I come back?

13
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:05,023
回去以后...
Alive!

14
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:08,004
那肯定会很疯狂
It's gonna be insane.

15
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:11,030
那么你认为那个救生艇有用了?
So you think the raft's gonna work?

16
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:13,031
当然它很有用  看看那个东西
Of course. Look at that thing.

17
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:17,032
那不是救生艇  他们造的是一艘船
It's not a raft. They built a sodding boat.

18
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:20,082
当他们获救的时候  直升飞机就会来的
When they get picked up, the helicopters will come,

19
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:26,081
这会让我们看起来很难以置信  并且会因此出名的
making us ridiculously and eternally famous.

20
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:28,054
怎么了?
What's the matter?

21
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:31,020
你不想出名么?
Don't you want to be famous?

22
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:37,065
你看看那边发生了什么?
What do you think's going on over there?

23
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:42,027
当然  如果你们不想死的话
Sure. You can absolutely wait a few weeks before you launch.

24
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:46,049
你们绝对应该等到几周后再出发
I was just assuming you didn't want to die.

25
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:51,059
那么  我们下一次能在什么时候出发?
So, uh, when's the next time we can launch?

26
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,086
3个...
Three...

27
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:55,021
可能是4个月吧
maybe four months.

28
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:58,049
好了  就算是电视里的气象员也不能准确预测天气
Come on! Even a weatherman on TV don't know what's gonna happen.

29
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,048
我们为什么要听Arzt的?
Why are we listening to Arzt?

30
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,052
因为我是一个博士  而你只是一个山里的农民
Because I'm a doctor and you're a hillbilly.

31
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,016
你是一个混蛋的高中理科老师
You're a damn high school science teacher.

32
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:09,047
Sawyer  让他说下去
Hey, Sawyer, let's just let the man talk.

33
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,006
这些天来每天下午都下雨
It's been raining every afternoon.

34
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:15,055
这就是说我们正处在季风季节快要来的时候
That means that we are on the cusp of monsoon season.

35
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:18,093
季风季节是很不利的
Monsoon season is bad.

36
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:24,048
现在  信风正在向北面吹
Now, the trade winds are blowing north right now.

37
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:26,017
行船的方向是向北的
Shipping lanes are north.

38
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:29,052
北面才是你们真正想去的
So north is exactly where you want to be.

39
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:30,030
那说明了什么?
What's that mean?

40
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:33,043
那是说当季风季节来的时候
It means, when the monsoon season hits,

41
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:36,069
信风会转而向南方吹
the trade winds are gonna shift to the south.

42
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,022
救生艇是顺着风向走的
The raft goes with the wind.

43
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:44,081
有人知道我们南面唯一的陆地是哪个么?
Can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that's south of us?

44
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:46,099
南极洲
Antarctica.

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,036
说对了Jack  南极洲
That's right, Jack. Antarctica.

46
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:52,028
那么我们应该什么时候走?
So when do we have to leave?

47
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:55,028
昨天
Yesterday.

48
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:05,047
那么很明显你是相信他了?
So obviously you believe him.

49
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:09,033
Arzt?  我不知道  但是我是不会放弃任何机会的
Arzt? I don't know. But I'm not taking any chances.

50
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:11,079
你认为你明天前能准备好么?
You think you'll be ready by tomorrow?

51
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,069
那人说没一天可以浪费了
Man said not a day to waste.

52
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,082
补给都备好了?   你准备了食物  淡水...
Supplies all set? You got food, fresh water, every...

53
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:19,013
Kate别冲动  但是我有事要做
Look, Kate, no offense, but I got work to do.

54
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:21,042
为什么突然这么感兴趣?
Why the sudden interest?

55
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:24,033
因为我要和你一起走
Because I'm going with you.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:42,011
迷 失
第一季 第二十二集

57
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:45,055
救生艇满了  我们只能载四个人 而人已经齐了
Look, raft's full. We need four, we got four.

58
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:48,027
-包括Sawyer么?  -是的
-Including Sawyer?  -Including him.

59
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:51,022
我们需要他的东西  所以他用他的东西换来了他的船票
We needed the stuff he had, so he bought his way on.

60
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:52,069
在第一个已经被烧了的救生艇上
On the first raft, which burned.

61
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,011
我不来跟你辩理  我告诉过他...
I'm not gonna get into semantics. I told the guy...

62
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,018
他甚至不知道怎么航海
He doesn't know how to sail.

63
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:58,033
那么你知道?
And you do?

64
00:05:58,034 --> 00:06:02,073
我在喷气船上当了两年的船员  我知道在帆船上该怎么做
I spent two summers crewing Jlboats. I know my way around a sailboat.

65
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:09,013
也许是这样...  但是交易就是交易
Yeah... maybe so, but a deal's a deal. I'm sorry.

66
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:11,091
你也带Walt么?
You're bringing Walt too?

67
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,012
我刚说了那是很危险的
I'm just saying it's dangerous.

68
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:17,070
我来决定怎么保护我孩子的安全
I decide what's best for my boy.

69
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:21,043
现在对他来说最好的事就是离开这个该死的岛了
And right now, what's best for him is to get the hell off this island.

70
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:24,000
救生艇已经满了
The raft's full.

71
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,039
我有快递给Diane Jansen
I have a delivery for Diane Jansen.

72
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,097
她刚从重点护理组出来  她在208房间
She just came up from ICU. She's in room 208.

73
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,051
好的
Okay.

74
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:45,087
在你右边的拐角处
Around the corner, to your right.

75
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:48,051
-谢谢  -不客气
-Thanks.  -You're welcome.

76
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:25,016
Tom

77
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:30,031
Katie

78
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,017
你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

79
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,025
Diane得了癌症快死了
Diane's dying of cancer.

80
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:41,002
虽然我还欠着她没去看她
I thought I owed it to her to come see her.

81
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,096
我听说了  我很难过
I heard. I'm sorry.

82
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:47,060
是的  我也是
Yeah, me too.

83
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:54,028
那么你坐在我车的后面有什么特殊的原因么?
So any particular reason why you're hanging out in the back of my car?

84
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,003
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

85
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,099
你也要走么?

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,024
拜托了Jin  说说话

87
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,048
是的  我也要走

88
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:37,002
还有多远?
How much further?

89
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:38,078
快到了
We're almost there.

90
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,003
可以告诉我我们去哪儿了吧  Sayid
Wanna tell me where we're going, Sayid?

91
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:43,005
你最好还是自己看看
It's better that you see it for yourself.

92
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,001
不  我不是太肯定
No, I'm not so sure it is.

93
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,092
告诉我你为什么把我带到这儿来  不然我就回去了
Tell me why you brought me here or I turn around.

94
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,057
是我叫他把你带到这儿来的
He brought you out here because I asked him to.

95
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:54,095
我叫他别和你说
I asked him not to tell you.

96
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:57,044
我希望你虚心一点
I wanted you to have an open mind.

97
00:08:57,045 --> 00:09:00,038
对什么虚心一点?
Open mind about what?

98
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:33,031
天那
My God.

99
00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:38,002
-这是什么东西?  -正是那个东西
-What is this thing?  -Exactly.

100
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:42,080
我想是时间我们谈谈这个了
I guess it's time we talked about this.

101
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,094
长官
Yo, chief!

102
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:55,040
有几个问题
Dumb question here.

103
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,018
我们是要在海上航行  是么?
We're sailing out on the ocean right?

104
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,075
你认为呢?
You mind?

105
00:09:58,076 --> 00:10:02,092
这个苏禄人打理的手提箱里尽是腌鱼
Sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish.

106
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,043
那又怎么?
Yeah?

107
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,068
我们不能抓鱼么?
We can't catch fish?

108
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:09,015
你知道多少在海上的生存知识?
Do you know anything about surviving at sea?

109
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:12,033
航行?  驾驶?  掌舵?
Sailing? Navigating? Steering a raft?

110
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:13,027
你会么?
Do you?

111
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:16,009
不管我知不知道  船是我造的
Doesn't matter what I know, I built it.

112
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,071
也许让你上救生艇是一个错误
Maybe you are the wrong guy to go on the raft.

113
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:23,000
你要踢掉我是么  米基?
You gonna vote me off, Mickey?

114
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,015
那么哪个顶替我的是哪个混蛋?
And who the hell's gonna take my place?

115
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,011
你以为你在做什么混账事?
What the hell you think you're doing?

116
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:43,008
别装作你不知道
Don't give me the "Aw, golly" eyes.

117
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,046
Michael刚刚跟我说了你骗取了我上救生艇的名额
Michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft.

118
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:51,007
我只是问了几个问题  他肯定是误解我了
I was just asking some questions. He must've misunderstood me.

119
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:52,099
我知道你在做什么
I know what you're doing.

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,049
-是么?  -是的
-Yeah?  -Yeah.

121
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,041
就像我知道你为什么这么想要拿回Haliburton证件
Just like I know why you wanted that Haliburton case so bad.

122
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:02,079
那个属于和我们坐同一架飞机的美国军官的东西
The one that belonged to the U.S. Marshal who was flying with us.

123
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:08,016
-你是他的犯人  -放开我
-You were his prisoner.  -Let go of me.

124
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,054
唯一逃跑的机会就是上救生艇  不是么?
Your only chance of running's getting on that raft, ain't it?

125
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:16,093
我们会被一艘船救起
If we get picked up by a ship,

126
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:20,075
而后回来营救剩下的那些人
when they come back to rescue the rest of y'all,

127
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:24,044
你的名字旁就会有一颗漂亮的大星号
gonna be a nice big asterisk next to your name.

128
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,024
亲爱的  别担心
Well, don't worry, puddin',

129
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:32,001
你的秘密我会帮你保守的
your secret's safe with me.

130
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:34,020
但是你也要知道
But just so you know,

131
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:38,020
你绝对别想取代我的位置上救生艇
no way in hell you're getting my spot on that raft.

132
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:44,041
Sawyer
Hey, Sawyer!

133
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:46,087
我要那个名额
I want your spot,

134
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:49,085
我会替代你的名额的
I'll get your spot.

135
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:04,090
伙计  给我瓶水
Give me that water, man.

136
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:10,039
给你  爸爸
Yo, Dad!

137
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,058
谢谢
Thanks.

138
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:18,075
你刚才在和Sawyer吵什么?
So, what were you and Sawyer arguing about?

139
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:21,079
我向他说了一些他不想听的事
I told him something he didn't want to hear.

140
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,059
为什么他那么想上救生艇?
Why does he wanna get on the raft so much?

141
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:28,023
因为他知道上这艇他就会获救的
Cause he knows it's gonna work.

142
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:29,091
当我们获救时
When we get rescued,

143
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:32,016
我们会回来营救剩下的那些人的  对么?
we're gonna come back for everybody else, right?

144
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,095
是的  那是当然了
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

145
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,055
但是有件事
But the thing is...

146
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,055
这个岛...
this island...

147
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,066
是...  想再找到它有点难
is... finding it again might be hard.

148
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:48,024
我们能坐飞机来找么?
Can't we fly around and look for it?

149
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,047
当然可以
Absolutely.

150
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:54,079
但是还不能保证能找到  这就是为什么你和...
But there's no guarantees. That's why you and...

151
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,000
爸爸?
Dad?

152
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:05,031
这就是为什么你...
That's why you...

153
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,044
爸爸
Dad!

154
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:10,066
爸爸
Dad!

155
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:13,017
叫Jack来
Get Jack.

156
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:25,074
帮帮忙
Help!

157
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:28,002
我需要帮忙  我爸爸不对了
I need help! It's my dad.

158
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:31,036
-怎么了?  -他的胃很痛
-What's the matter?  -His stomach is really bad.

159
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:34,025
把他带回Michael那儿  我去找Jack
Take him back to Michael. I'll go get Jack.

160
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:37,087
-好的  我们快走  -往这边
-Okay. Let's go.  -This way.

161
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,007
Jack

162
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:47,027
Jack

163
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:50,067
你发现这个多久了?
How long have you known about this?

164
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:52,082
3周吧  差不多是的
Three weeks, give or take.

165
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,049
3周了
Three weeks.

166
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,067
你来这儿挖这个东西已经有3周了
You've been out here for three weeks digging this thing up

167
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,065
而你却从没和我说起过?
and you never told me?

168
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:02,039
尊敬的Jack  什么时候我向你汇报事情过了?
All due respect, Jack, but since when do I report to you?

169
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,061
尊敬的John  你说谎了
All due respect, John, but you lied.

170
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,090
在你决定和大家说之前
How long did you have that case full of guns

171
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:13,072
你有一整箱的枪这个秘密你保守了多久了?
before you decided the rest of us needed to know?

172
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:18,009
你有你自己的判断力  我有我的
You used your best discretion. I used mine.

173
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:25,055
-那么我们怎么才能打开它?  -什么?
-So how do we open it?  -What?

174
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:27,070
你想打开它?
You want to open it?

175
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,091
是的
Yeah.

176
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:31,084
我们应该埋了它
We should bury it.

177
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:34,045
我带你来是为了让你劝他离开这个疯狂的东西
I brought you here to talk him out of this insanity.

178
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:35,061
里面可能会有任何东西
Anything could be inside.

179
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:37,054
最好的想法是  里面有补给资源
Best case scenario, there's supplies.

180
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,043
最坏的也只是我们把它当遮蔽物来用
Worst case, we use it as a shelter.

181
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,051
Jack  事实上我能想到比那更坏的事
Actually, Jack, I can think of much worse cases than that.

182
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:45,022
你注意到这个舱门的一些问题了么?
You notice anything about this hatch?

183
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,072
没有把手
There's no handle.

184
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:50,025
原因已经再明显不过了
Could the reason for that be more obvious?

185
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:54,080
可能本来它就不打算让人从外面打开
Maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside.

186
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,057
Jack

187
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:05,044
Jack

188
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:08,015
我在这儿
Yeah! Over here!

189
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,034
是Michael  有点不对劲
It's Michael. Something's wrong.

190
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:21,093
你今天吃了什么?
What'd you eat today?

191
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:26,097
水果...  鱼
Fruit, fish.

192
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:29,063
喝了足够的水了么?
Drinking enough water?

193
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:31,018
两三瓶吧
Two, three bottles.

194
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,056
你从哪儿打来的水?
Where are you getting that water from?

195
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,048
和其它人一样  山洞里打的
The caves, like everybody else.

196
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,011
好的  听着Michael...
All right, listen, Michael.

197
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:37,057
放松一下  好么?
You just take it easy.

198
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:41,005
呆在阴凉的地方  尽量不要乱动
You stay in the shade. You try not to move too much, Okay?

199
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:43,090
我们得在明天启航  必须要
We have to launch that raft tomorrow. We have to.

200
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:47,056
我知道  我要你躺回去
I know. I need you to lay back.

201
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,085
躺下吧
Lay down.

202
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,082
躺下  好么?
Just lay down. Okay?

203
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:04,048
Adam

204
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:07,087
听我说  你能凑出点时间来帮我做核磁共振么?
listen, can you carve out some time for me on the MRI?

205
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:11,092
是的  是帮我一个朋友的朋友的忙
Yeah, it's... it's a favor for a friend of a friend.

206
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:16,092
-不 那可以解决的  -好的  谢谢 Adam
-No, that'll work out great.  -Okay. Yeah, thanks, Adam.

207
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,015
他叫Connor
His name's Connor.

208
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:27,011
-几岁了?  -下周就满22个月了
-How old is he?  -Twenty-two months next week.

209
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,080
他真的很漂亮
He's beautiful.

210
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:35,069
那多亏了Rachel  不是我
Yeah, well, that's Rachel, that's not me.

211
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:38,069
她在哪儿?
Where is she?

212
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,092
她去Cedar Rapids探望亲属了
She's over in Cedar Rapids visiting her folks.

213
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:44,058
周日才回来

214
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,051
我叫Diane来做核磁共振了

215
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:50,053
他们会把她带到楼下的X射线科的
They'll bring her downstairs to radiology.

216
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:54,034
约定是在早上的5点  那么...
And her appointment's not until 5 am,

217
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:57,049
我们还有3小时的时间
so we've got about three hours to kill.

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,032
-Tom...  -不客气
-Tom...  -You're welcome.

219
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:11,005
你想它还在哪儿么?
You think it's still there?

220
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:13,023
什么?
What?

221
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,074
你知道的
You know what.

222
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:20,025
现在是午夜啊  Katie
It's the middle of the night, Katie.

223
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:23,059
我们不会再有机会了
We might not get another chance.

224
00:17:57,002 --> 00:18:03,048
1  2  3  4  5... 6
One, two, three, four, five, six.

225
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,092
你认为他怎么了  中暑?
What do you think it is? Heatstroke?

226
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:19,008
不  他感到那是突然痛起来的
No. He would've felt that coming on.

227
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:21,009
也许是坏水果?  生吃的鱼?
Bad fruit, maybe? Raw fish?

228
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,043
Michael和Jin吃的东西是一样的
Michael and Jin are on the same diet.

229
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:26,081
-并且Jin没事  -Jin没事
-And Jin's fine.  -Jin's fine.

230
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:32,010
不管怎么样他的病痛是突然袭来的
Whatever's making him sick was metabolized fast.

231
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,026
得病很快  而且很痛苦
It hit him quick, and it hit him hard.

232
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:37,032
那么你认为是那瓶水了?
So you think it was the water?

233
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:41,002
不  我不认为是因为水
No, I don't think it was the water.

234
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:44,012
我认为是因为水里面的东西
I think it was something in the water.

235
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:50,075
感觉好点了么?
Feeling any better?

236
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:53,052
腹部的绞痛平息下来了
Cramps are quieting down.

237
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:56,071
只要我不动或是
As long as I don't move,

238
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:59,044
或是呼吸
or breathe.

239
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:08,037
你和Locke和好了么?
You and Locke kiss and make up?

240
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:11,044
好的
Good.

241
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:16,078
-不 Michael  -什么?
-No, Michael.  -What?

242
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,002
喝这儿的
Drink from that one.

243
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:26,026
-有人暗算我?  -我不知道
-Somebody did this to me?  -I don't know.

244
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:29,023
我还不能肯定
I'm not sure of anything yet.

245
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,071
Sawyer

246
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:37,039
我的任务是抗竹子  但是有时是我去灌水的
I'm on bamboo duty, but sometimes I help refill the water.

247
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,099
Michael和Jin相处得好么?
Michael and Jin getting along?

248
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,091
他们一起造救生艇  吵架时也像是一对结了婚的夫妻
They fight like a married couple building a raft together.

249
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:44,079
你和他说了?
You told him?

250
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,042
他认为可能是Sawyer干的
He thinks Sawyer might've done it.

251
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:48,061
是因为Kate么?
'cause of Kate?

252
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,066
Kate

253
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,058
是的  我猜她想上救生艇
Yeah, I guess she wants on the raft.

254
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,000
所以Sawyer暗算Michael  因为你知道他决定谁上艇
So Sawyer went off on Michael because he gets to decide who goes.

255
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:57,056
你们不会认为是Kate干的吧  是么?
You don't think Kate did it?

256
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,068
Kate为什么向Michael下毒?
Why would Kate poison Michael?

257
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:04,019
你知道  整个逃亡的事
Well, you know, the whole fugitive thing.

258
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,089
他不知道
He doesn't know?

259
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:16,096
我怎么能知道这边上谁不知道
How am I supposed to keep straight who knows what?

260
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:18,077
我是说Steve甚至连北极熊的事也不知道
Steve didn't know about the polar bear.

261
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:21,018
她做了什么?
What did she do?

262
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,000
我不知道  你为什么不去问她?
I don't know. Why don't you ask her?

263
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:27,053
你认为其它人不需要知道这个么  Jack?
You didn't think the others should know about this, Jack?

264
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:30,073
判断力  John
Discretion, John.

265
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:42,065
好了 你能不要动么 我会把你的耳朵减下来的
Okay, can you stop moving or I'm gonna cut your ear off.

266
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,036
这很好
This is good.

267
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:47,097
我又在写歌了  我真的感觉很好
I'm writing again. I'm really feeling it, as well.

268
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:54,023
那么...  当你获救后你会做得第一件事是什么?
So, what's the first thing you're gonna do when we get rescued?

269
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:58,019
你知道  事实上我还不知道
You know, I don't really know.

270
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,077
你能在洛杉矶和我闲逛
You can hang out with me in LA.

271
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:02,086
你和你孩子
You and Turnip Head.

272
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:06,041
你知道  直到你了解到什么
You know, until you figure things out.

273
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:08,039
谢谢
Thanks.

274
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,097
好了  听听这首吧  这是第二首
Okay. Check this out. This is track two.

275
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:15,042
叫做...   对不起 
It's called... Sorry.

276
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:18,055
叫做"怪兽吃了飞行员"
It's called Monster Eats The Pilot.

277
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,068
Michael怎么样了?
How's Michael?

278
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:35,096
他会没事的
He's gonna be fine.

279
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:41,019
有人可以取代他上救生艇么?
Is somebody gonna be taking his place on the raft?

280
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,026
我不知道
I don't know.

281
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:46,011
因为你知道  Arzt博士说如果他们明天不...
Dr. Arzt said if they don't leave...

282
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:48,077
是你给Michael下的毒么  Kate?
Did you poison Michael, Kate?

283
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:54,049
他不是生病  是有人在暗算他
He's not sick. Someone did this.

284
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:05,067
你真的以为我能做到么?
Do you really think I'm capable of that?

285
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:11,005
我不知道什么是你能做到的
I don't know what you're capable of.

286
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,057
你带了啤酒?
You brought beer?

287
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:32,091
爱荷华州有自尊心的男人去哪儿都带着啤酒
No self-respecting man in lowa goes anywhere without beer.

288
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:42,044
这不公平  你知道
It's not fair, you know,

289
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,047
你回到...
you coming back.

290
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:46,023
这儿来...
Here.

291
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:48,039
家里
Home.

292
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,079
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

293
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:40,009
看看这东西
Wow! Look at this stuff.

294
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,091
天那  我的飞机
Oh, my God! My plane.

295
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:49,057
我无法相信你说服我让我把这个放进这箱子
I can't believe I let you talk me into putting this in there.

296
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:52,018
那是你的主意
That was your idea.

297
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,049
Kate和Tom
Kate and Tom.

298
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,008
1989年

299
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:10,033
开始录了么?  我想还没开始吧
Is it on? I don't think it's on.

300
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,059
它在录了
It's on.

301
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,034
好的  我们是Kate Austen和Tom Brennan
Okay, uh, this is Kate Austen and Tom Brennan.

302
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:20,062
并且这是  我们为时间容器做的贡献
And this is our dedication for our time capsule

303
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:23,055
现在是1989年8月15日...
here on August 15th, 1989.

304
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:25,023
把那还给我
Hey, give me that back!

305
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:27,073
你为什么把这个傻傻的飞机放在里面呢?
Why are you putting this stupid plane in there?

306
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:29,000
因为它很酷  Katie
Because it's cool, Katie.

307
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,084
是我单独坐飞机去达拉斯时买的
I got it when I flew to Dallas by myself.

308
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:34,004
确实很酷  就像这个时间容器一样
Ooh, that is cool! Just like this time capsule.

309
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,089
当我们...比如20年后把它挖出来那会更酷
It'll be totally cool when we dig it up in, like, 20 years.

310
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,083
你怎么知道我们还会在一起?
How do you know we'll be together?

311
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:40,081
因为我们会结婚
'Cause we'll be married. You'll be a mom

312
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:43,027
然后你就会做妈妈  并且我们会有9个孩子
and we'll have nine kids.

313
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:45,037
我可不这么想
I don't think so.

314
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,032
一旦我有了驾照  我们可以开一辆车...
As soon as I get my license,

315
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,087
就像  你知道的私奔
we should just get in a car and drive. Like, you know, run away.

316
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:53,026
你老是想着私奔  Katie
You always wanna run away, Katie.

317
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:57,018
是的  你知道为什么
Yeah. And you know why.

318
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:01,060
事实上的结果是不是很有趣?
Funny how things turn out, huh?

319
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:05,086
是啊
Yeah.

320
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:50,007
对不起
Sorry.

321
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:56,081
我们得去医院了
We better get to the hospital.

322
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,053
是的
Yeah.

323
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,070
怎么了?
What happened?

324
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:22,078
出了点小意外
I had a little accident.

325
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,009
-痛么?  -是的
-Does it hurt?  -Yep.

326
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:33,026
你有事想和我说是么  Walt?
Something you wanna tell me, Walt?

327
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:36,027
不是我做的
I didn't do it.

328
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,051
什么不是你做的?
Didn't do what?

329
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:40,075
我听Jack说了
I heard Jack.

330
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:44,000
他认为有人暗算我爸爸
He thinks somebody got my dad sick.

331
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:46,071
不是我做的
And I didn't do it.

332
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:48,088
你以为我知道是你烧了第一艘救生艇
You think because I know you burned the first raft

333
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:52,017
就会怀疑是你让你爸中毒了?
I'd think you made your dad sick?

334
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:57,026
我们是朋友  Walt
We're friends, aren't we Walt?

335
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:59,046
我以前没有告你的密  现在我也不会这么做
I didn't tell on you before, and I'm not gonna now.

336
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:03,044
我知道你不会做任何伤害你爸爸的事的
And I know you would never do anything to hurt your dad.

337
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:08,075
怎么了?
What's the matter?

338
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:11,029
别打开它
Don't open it.

339
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:12,019
你说什么?
What did you say?

340
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,061
别打开它  Locke先生  别打开那个东西
Don't open it, Mr. Locke. Don't open that thing.

341
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:17,009
什么...什么东西?  你在...
What? What thing? What are you...?

342
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,066
只要别打开就行了
Just don't open it!

343
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:25,045
我想你大概需要这个  老板
Thought you might need that, boss.

344
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:29,060
你不会想让我们的引航员在出发之前就报销吧
Wouldn't want our pilot out of commission before takeoff.

345
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:32,021
什么  你有负罪感了?
What? You feeling guilty?

346
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:34,037
什么?
What?

347
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:37,059
你从救生艇上被除名了
You're off the raft.

348
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,092
再说一遍?
Come again?

349
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:41,090
你被除名了
You're off the raft.

350
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:43,008
我们有过交易
We had a deal.

351
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:47,024
是的  在你想要向我下毒的那刻起  交易就失效了
Well, the deal ended the minute you decided to poison me.

352
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:48,093
我做了什么?
I did what now?

353
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:49,093
我和你没关系了
I'm done with you.

354
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:52,032
你和我还没完
You ain't done with me by a damn sight.

355
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:53,078
你说你需要四个人
You said you needed four.

356
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,047
我有四个人了
I got four.

357
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,092
你从死尸那里偷东西
You've been stealing stuff off of dead bodies,

358
00:27:57,093 --> 00:28:00,083
占为己有  用那些来买通方便
keeping it for yourself, using it to buy favors.

359
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:02,070
你是一个说谎的人  是一个罪犯
You're a liar and a criminal!

360
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:04,052
我是不会让你接近我的孩子的
I'm not letting you near my boy!

361
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:06,022
我是个罪犯  是么?
Oh, I'm a criminal?

362
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:09,047
我向你下毒因为我是个罪犯
I poisoned you 'cause I'm a criminal?

363
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:12,072
把手拿开  小子
Get your hands off me, boy.

364
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:16,038
性感臀部的小姐
Hey, sweet cheeks!

365
00:28:18,017 --> 00:28:21,044
我不知道你为什么这么想离开这里
I had no idea how bad you wanted off this rock.

366
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:23,041
该是时候向大家说明了
Time to set things straight.

367
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,079
-告诉他谁才是罪犯  -好了 放开他 你这家伙
-Tell him who the criminal is.  -Leave her alone, man.

368
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,046
告诉他
Tell him.

369
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:32,099
-还给我  -离远点
-Give that back!  -Leave her alone.

370
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,001
-还给我  -离远点

Look at this.

373
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,091
Sawyer  不要
Sawyer, please.

374
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:51,070
你们都还记得Joanna  是吧?
You all remember Joanna, don't you?

375
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:55,000
那个淹死了的女人
The woman who drowned?

376
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:58,019
现在  看看Kate想拿可怜的Joanna的身份证做什么
Now, what's Kate doing with poor Joanna's ID?

377
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,081
她想上救生艇
Could it be she'd do just about anything to get on that raft,

378
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:03,097
然后获救
so she could get herself rescued?

379
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:05,065
在世界上一半的记者出现在这个混蛋的岛之前
Run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world

380
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:08,086
以一个新的身份潜逃
descend on this damn island?

381
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:10,063
她还可能向船长下毒
She might poison the captain himself.

382
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:12,095
闭嘴
Shut up.

383
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:21,091
她不在乎别的什么  只在乎她自己
She don't care about nothing or nobody but herself.

384

00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,066
我是她的女儿  她有点神志不清   我要去找医生
I'm her daughter. She's confused. I was getting a doctor.

406
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,063
等一下
Hang on.

407
00:32:01,064 --> 00:32:03,073
我们这儿有情况...
We got a situation down...

408
00:32:03,074 --> 00:32:07,004

出去
Get out.

412
00:32:45,073 --> 00:32:47,098

I am not letting you do this. You cooperate, they'll go easy.

413
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,020
他在叫救援  出去
He's calling back-up. Get out!

414
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:52,030
-你会有个真实的生活的  -Tom  拜托了
-You can have a real life. -Tom, please.

415
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:53,016
不
No.

416
00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:54,076
马上
Now!

417
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:57,067
-出去  -不
-Get out!  -No!

418
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,083
Tom
Tom?

419
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:28,058
Tom?

420
00:33:29,013 --> 00:33:30,044
Tom?

421
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:31,094
天那  Tom
Oh, God. Tom!

422
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:37,023
不不不不  Tom  拜托你醒醒
No, no, no, no! Tom! Come on, please wake up.

423
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:56,001
你想告诉我们为什么你这么想逃走么?
You wanna tell us why you need to run so bad?

424
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:58,090
你想告诉我们真相么?
You wanna tell us the truth?

425
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:11,081
是的
Yes.

426
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:15,003
我在飞机上...
I was on the plane...

427
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:19,035
和一个军官在一起
with the Marshal.

428
00:34:20,045 --> 00:34:24,009
是的  我被通缉了...
Yes, I was wanted...

429
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:25,099
并且被捕了...
and caught

430
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,022
正在被遣送回国
and being transported back.

431
00:34:30,055 --> 00:34:36,000
不管我怎么说发生了什么  我应该怎么做...
No matter what I say about what happened, about what I supposedly did...

432
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:39,089
我还是会进监狱的
I'm going to jail.

433
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:46,098
但是我没有向你下毒
But I didn't poison you.

434
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:57,008
给你
Here.

435
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:02,023
-看来他是下定决心了  -是的
-He looks determined.  -Yes. He is.

436
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:08,010
你不想他走  是么?
You don't want him to go, do you?

437
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,077
是的  我不想
No.

438
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:15,049
这就是为什么你试图让他中毒?
Is that why you tried to make him sick?

439
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:20,017
Michael和Jin整天在一起工作
Michael and Jin working together all the time,

440
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:24,008
他们很容易把他们的水瓶搞混
pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up.

441
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:36,062
我不想让他死在海上
I didn't want him to die out there.

442
00:36:41,052 --> 00:36:45,033
我只是不知道该怎么办
I just didn't know what to do.

443
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:51,051
我用的剂量只能使他...
I only used enough to make him...

444
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,033
我不想伤害他的
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

445
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:05,054
你会告诉其他人么?
Are you gonna tell the others?

446
00:37:05,082 --> 00:37:09,038
他们没理由需要知道的
I don't see any reason why they need to know.

447
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,075
但是  Sun...
But Sun...

448
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:14,050
他要走了
...he's going.

449
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:17,013
如果我是你  我会...
If I were you, I'd...

450
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,042
我会说再见
I'd say goodbye.

451
00:37:58,017 --> 00:38:00,088
我又回救生艇上了
I'm back on the raft.

452
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:05,096
很替你高兴
Glad to hear it.

453
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:13,003
Michael正在打点  我们明天启航
Michael's gonna cowboy up. We set sail tomorrow.

454
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:17,073
你是来说"对不起"的么  Sawyer?
Are you here to say sorry, Sawyer?

455
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:22,081
"对不起"不像是我说的话
Sorry don't suit me.

456
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:28,025
你把我逼急了  亲爱的  我只是做我该做的
You cornered me, Freckles. I did what I had to.

457
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:29,035
我把你逼急了
I cornered you?

458
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:32,078
你说如果你想要我这个名额  你就会得到的
You said if you wanted my spot, you were gonna take it.

459
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,075
我想我是相信你了
Guess I believed you.

460
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:46,011
就这样了
Well... that's that.

461
00:38:50,055 --> 00:38:53,050
我要整理东西去了
I got some packing to do.

462
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:59,062
为什么上那个救生艇会对你这么重要?
Why is it so important for you to be on that raft?

463
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:14,007
因为这个岛上没有什么可期望的了
'Cause there ain't anything on this island worth staying for.

464
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:30,083
一路顺风  Sawyer
Be safe, Sawyer.

465
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:36,042
肯定会的
Yeah.

466
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:53,074
-爸爸  -伙计
-Dad?  -Hey, buddy!

467
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,091
好点了么?
You getting better?

468
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:59,065
是的  当然马上会全好的
Yeah. Yep, I'm gonna be all right.

469
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:04,039
别担心
Hey. Don't worry.

470
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,094
我马上会恢复健康的
I'm gonna be on my feet soon

471
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:09,004
而且我们就要出海回家了  在你...
and we'll be sailing home before you can even...

472
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:12,007
我就是那个烧了救生艇的人
I'm the one that burned the raft.

473
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,020
我不想离开  我想我可以阻止你
I didn't wanna leave, and I thought I could stop you.

474
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:27,064
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

475
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,098
我真的很抱歉  爸爸
I'm really sorry, Dad.

476
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:37,054
没事的  伙计
It's okay, man.

477
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:42,044
我们能留在这儿的
We can stay here.

478
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,036
你和我
You and me.

479
00:40:45,037 --> 00:40:48,017
我们不需要离开的
We don't have to go.

480
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:53,030
不  我们会离开的
Yes, we do.

481
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:07,004
你好
Hello.

482
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:18,079
Jack知道了
Jack knows.

483
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:25,051
我没告诉他这是你的主意
I didn't tell him it was your idea.

484
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:30,045
谢谢
Thanks.

485
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:32,055
你为什么会被惩罚?
Why should you be punished?

486
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:36,006
你只是在试着帮助我
You were only trying to help me.

487
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,087
他说他不会告诉其他人的
He said he wouldn't tell the others.

488
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:44,051
是的
Yeah.

489
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:48,001
Jack对保守秘密很在行
Jack's good at keeping secrets.

490
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:51,070
当我还是个小女孩...
When I was a little girl,

491
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:57,056
我相信一旦我找到我爱的男人...
I believed that once I found the man I loved...

492
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:02,043
我会很幸福的...
I would be happy...

493
00:42:02,044 --> 00:42:04,090
永远
forever.

494
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:10,038
是的
Yeah.

495
00:42:16,095 --> 00:42:33,095
