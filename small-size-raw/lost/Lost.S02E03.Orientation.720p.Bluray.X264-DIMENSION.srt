Who the hell is that?

快滚  不然我杀了他
Move and I kill him.

Michael     Sawyer

21
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:35,065
Jin

22
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,043
其他人  其他人
Others! Others!

23
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,089
其他人  其他人
Others! Others!

24
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:45,060
-什么?    -其他人
-What?    -Others.

25
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:38,053
我的孩子在哪儿?
Where's my boy?

26
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:41,022
我的孩子在哪儿?
Where's my boy?

27
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,075
嘿  你们把我的孩子怎么了?
Hey, what did you do with my boy?

28
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:46,012
你听到没?
You hear me?

29
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:49,066
回来
Come back here!

30
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,013
你想让他死吗?
Do you want him to die?

31
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:55,045
把枪放下
Put it down.

32
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:01,063
这就是你所说的吗  Locke?
Is this what you were talking about, Locke?

33
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:05,009
这就是你的命运吗?
Is this your destiny?

34
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:10,026
该发生的还是会发生的
"All roads lead here".

35
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:13,044
这星期我妈又偷了我的钱
My mother stole again from me this week.

36
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:17,059
我现在都不把钱放在钱包里了 我一直把钱藏着
I don't even keep money in my purseanymore, I've been hiding it.

37
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:20,070
但她一要喝酒...
But when she wants a drink...

38
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,053
就偷了我30块
She stole 30 dollars.

39
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:26,055
我知道这对于你们其中的一些人来说不算什么
I know it may not seem like a lot of money to some of you,

40
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:29,001
但对于我来说却是一个大数目
but it's a lot to me.

41
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,095
我想要回我的钱
And I want it back.

42
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:36,081
你有什么要说的吗?
Something you want to say?

43
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:41,018
John  你来这儿已经一个月了...
John, you've been coming here for a month now...

44
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:44,073
我觉得30块钱不值得你这么大惊小怪
I just don't think 30 dollars is worth getting angry about.

45
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,039
Francine觉得30块...
Francine feels 30 dollars...

46
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,034
是Francine想得太多了
Francine feels a little too much, if you ask me.

47
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:51,058
你们都是
You all do.

48
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:53,095
我是很认真的
I mean, seriously...

49
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:57,023
"他再也没给我回电话" "我妈偷了我30块"
"So-and-so never called me back." "My mother stole 30 dollars."

50
00:03:57,023 --> 00:04:00,038
我甚至都不知道自己父母是谁
I never even knew who my parents were.

51
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:05,099
几年前  我的...我的亲生母亲找到了我  然后...
Couple years ago, my birth mother found me.And...

52
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,084
她告诉我...
she told me...

53
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:13,098
我很特别
I was special.

54
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:18,086
并且...并且她带我去见了我的亲生父亲
And...and through her I met my real father.

55
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:20,032
好消息  不是么?
Great news, right?

56
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:23,093
他假装很爱我  为的就是
he pretended to love me, just long enough

57
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:26,045
从我这里骗走我的肾 因为他需要一个肾来做移植
to steal my kidney, because he had to have a transplant.

58
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:29,097
然后他把我像垃圾一样丢了出来
And then he dropped me back in the world like a piece of trash,

59
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:34,017
就像我刚出生时他丢了我那样
just like he did on the day that I was born.

60
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:41,014
你想要回你那该死的30块 我想要回我的肾
You want your damn 30 dollars back. I want my kidney back!

61
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,021
这也许是件好事
Probably a good idea.

62
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:57,004
你知道  要是你得了肾癌 你只会有一个肾得癌
You know if you get kidney cancer, you've only got one.

63
00:04:57,004 --> 00:05:00,031
真的很有趣
That's funny.

64
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:03,030
如果这次聚会被我搞砸了我很抱歉
I'm sorry if I ruined your meeting.

65
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,024
哦  去它的  你只是讲出了 我在那儿一直想说的话
Oh, hell. You just said everything I've always wanted to say in there.

66
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,076
很多时候  我都想站起来大声喊
Most of the time, I want to stand up and scream.

67
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,060
"把那些事都忘了吧  笨蛋"
"Get over it, freaks!"

68
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,009
那你干嘛不这样做呢?
Well, why don't you?

69
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,098
我还是忍忍吧
I have to keep a cork in.

70
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:20,003
我要是一激动起来是很难停下来的
Once I get all hot and bothered, there's no stopping me.

71
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:24,014
我想你下周不会来了吧?
Guess you won't be coming back next week?

72
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:27,083
-是的  我不会来了  -噢  那太可惜了
-No, not likely.  -That's too bad.

73
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,029
我喜欢秃顶的男人
 I like bald guys.

74
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,090
-我还没秃顶呢  -我可以等
-I'm not bald.  -I can wait.

75
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:41,037
呃  顺便说一声  我叫...我叫Helen
I'm...I'm Helen, by the way.

76
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:45,060
你好  Helen  我是John
Hi, Helen.  I'm John.

77
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:47,073
Kate在哪儿?
Where's Kate?

78
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:51,025
把枪放下  不然我崩了他的脑袋
Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off.

79
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:54,057
Kate在哪儿?
Where's Kate?

80
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,019
把枪放下
Put it down.

81
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,066
我什么也不放
I'm not putting down anything!

82
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:50,001
冷静点  没事的
Jack, calm down. It's OK.

83
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:56,053
-不许动  -不  不要...
-Do not move!  -Don't...

84
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:57,085
-不要什么?  -他没有武器
-Don't what?  -He's unarmed...

85
00:06:57,085 --> 00:07:02,004
他刚刚还用枪指着你的头
He just had a gun pointed at your head!

86
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:07,025
你都干了什么?
What did you do?

87
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:11,029
你都干了什么?
What did you do?

88
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:17,047
我们都会死的
We're all gonna die.

I have to fix it.

93
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,029
他到底在说什么?
What the hell's he talking about

94
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:47,091
如果你不让我起来  我们都会死的
If you do not let me up, we are going to die.

95
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,033
别动  不然我要你好看...

看到了吗?

98
00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:56,073
那是个计时器  一直在倒数计时
That's a timer and it's counting down.

99
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:59,099
我得输入密码并且按下按键
I've got to enter the code, got to push the button.

100
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,089

101
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,069
-Jack  你还是让他起来吧  -不用告诉我该怎么做
-Jack, let him up.   -Don't tell me what to do.

00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:11,093
我们见过面吗?
Do I know you?

105
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,062
你看着他
You got him?

106
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:31,017
混蛋

107

你去哪儿了?
Where are you going?

111
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:04,020
没有  我...

我...
I...

113
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:11,060
我只是不习惯睡在其它床上
just have trouble sleeping in a strange bed.

114
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,077
不  这...这和你没关系  Helen  我保证
It has nothing to do with you, Helen.I promise.

119
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:53,074
John  我知道你喜欢在我家附近开车转悠
John, I know you like to drive through my neighbourhood.

120
00:09:53,074 --> 00:10:00,076
也知道你常常把车停在我家前面
And I know that every now and then, you like to park outside my house.

121
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:07,003
我本以为我搬了家你就不会来了 但是...你又来了
I thought it might all stop when I moved, but here you are.

122
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:11,091
我得承认  开始我是觉得挺有意思的
I'll admit, at first I thought it was funny.

123
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:14,032
但是现在这让我烦透了
Now it's just annoying.

124
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:19,065
你还是告诉我你到底想要什么吧?
So how about you tell me what the hell it is you want.

125
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,051
为什么?

126
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:28,011

128

没有为什么
There is no "why".

129
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,099
你以为你是第一个被我玩弄在股掌间的么?
You think you're the first person that ever got conned?

130
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:47,079
你需要一个象征性的父亲而我需要一个肾
You needed a father figure and I needed a kidney.

131
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,001
事情就这么发生了
And that's what happened.

132
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,026
忘了它吧
Get over it.

133
00:10:55,026 --> 00:11:00,035
还有John  别再来了
And, John, don't come back.

134

这儿不欢迎你
You're not wanted.

135
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:29,092
没必要用枪了  Kate
I don't think you need that, Kate.

136
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,043
你在找什么  也许我能帮上忙
Whatever you're looking for,maybe I can help.

137
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:37,087
你会修电脑吗?
Can you fix a computer?

138
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,076
那你就帮不了我了
Then you can't help me.

139
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:42,012
Sayid会修电脑
Sayid can fix a computer.

140

Get him.

141
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,066
去把Sayid叫来
Go and get Sayid.

142
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,020
你能顺着那根绳子爬回去吗?
Can you get back up that rope?

143
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,038
不用了  这里肯定还有个门
There's got to be a front door here.

144
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:50,097
在走廊尽头左转处
Down the corridor to the left.

145
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:54,083
用点力  把手很紧
Be persistent, the wheel sticks.

146
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:58,001
找到了
Got ya!

147
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,044
现在你得告诉我到底是怎么回事
Now, tell me what's going on.

148
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:16,063
Jack  我们没时间...
We don't have time...

149
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:18,039
-我们先停一会儿  -求你了  让我...
-We're taking a time-out.  -Please, just let me...

150
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,090
听着  如果你想继续做你的事 就先告诉我你怎么来到这儿的
You wanna get to work? Tell me how you got here.

151
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,069
是三年前了
It was three years ago.

152
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:26,078
我参加一个单人环球比赛时
I was on a solo race around the world,

153
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,001
船撞上了暗礁  然后Kelvin出现了
and my boat crashed into the reef and Kelvin came.

154
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:32,067
是Kelvin  他从丛林中跑了出来
Kelvin   He comes runnin' out the jungle,

155
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,039
"快点  快点  跟我来"
"Hurry! Hurry! Come with me!"

156
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,085
他把我带到这里
He brings me down here.

157
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:39,099
当时这个已经开始嘟嘟倒计时了 他做的第一件事就是
First thing he does, cos it's beeping,

158
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:45,037
输入密码  按下按键  声音就停了
he types in the code, pushes the button and it stops.

159
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,021
我问他"到底是怎么回事?"
"What was all that about?" I say.

160
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:53,030
他回答说"是在拯救世界"
"Just saving the world", he says.

161
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,006
拯救世界?
"Saving the world?"

162
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:59,085
是他说的
His words, not mine.

163
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:03,053
所以我也开始这么做了
So I started pushing the button too.

164
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:06,071
我们一起拯救世界的那段日子还不错
And we saved the world together for a while, and that was lovely.

165
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:12,047
然后Kelvin死了所以现在就我一个人了
Then Kelvin died. And now here I am all alone.

166
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,023
讲完了
The end!

167
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:32,099
你不会相信他的话吧 这太难以理解了
Don't tell me you believe this. This is crazy.

168
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:36,029
你觉得那可能吗  按个按钮就可以拯救世界?
You think that makes sense? Pushing a button?

169
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:37,095
你就那么相信他的话?
You're going to take his word for it?

170
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:41,054
我们也只能听他的了  Jack
His word is all we have, Jack.

171
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,048
你没必要只听我的话
You don't have to take my word for it.

172
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:47,006
看看影片吧
Watch the film.

173
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,005
什么?
What?

174
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:51,071
书架的最上层  《压力》那本书后面
The bookcase. Top shelf.Behind Turn of The Screw.

175
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:55,071
放映机在食品室
Projector's in the pantry.

176
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:31,072
等等
Here...

177
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:35,040
伙计  我说
Dude, I gotta say,

178
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,028
我还以为我们撑不过昨晚呢
I didn't think we were gonna get through the night.

179
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:41,098
而且那个婴儿被偷时我还不在场
And I wasn't even here for that baby-stealing part.

180
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:44,019
我能肯定的告诉你那件事很精彩
I can assure you it was very exciting.

181
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,004
事情也该是时候变得正常了
Things are finally returning to normalness.

182
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:49,094
Sayid

183
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,053
噢  见鬼
Aw,  crap.

184
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:54,036
Sayid...

185
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:58,037
我们需要你的帮忙
We need your help.

186
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,017
你知道些什么?他们对你做了什么?
What do you know? What'd they do to you?

187
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:08,010
他们到底是谁?
Who the hell are they?

188
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,095
他们到底是谁?
Who the hell are they?

189
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:15,021
其他人
Others!

190
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,096
你看到Walt了吗?
Did you see Walt?

191
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:20,003
其他人...有多少?
The Others? How many?

192
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,011
他们有多少人?
How many?

193
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:27,009
他们蒙住了他的眼睛
They had him blindfolded. Blindfolded.

194
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:31,027
他们可能有上百人
Could be a hundred of them out there!

195
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,080
-把我推上去  -什么?
-Push me up.  -What?

196
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,031
推我上去
Push me up.

197
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:40,084
我试试看能不能出去
I wanna try and get us outta here.

198
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:44,069
来吧  帮帮忙  伙计
C'mon, help us out, Chewie.

199
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:02,006
有东西压着
They got it weighted down with something.

200
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:05,034
并且在哪儿被打结固定了
It's tied off somewhere.

201
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:08,066
加油  把我举高点
Come on, lift me higher.

202
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,093
是个女的
It's a girl.

203
00:16:56,095 --> 00:17:01,023
能告诉我在我下来前这儿发生了什么么  John?
Wanna tell me what was going on down here before I showed up,John?

204
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,087
Kate被绑了起来  Desmond拿着枪指着我
Kate was tied up. Desmond had a gun on me.

205
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:08,040
我想基本上你已经知道个大概了
I think you caught the gist of it.

206
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,025
Desmond

207
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:14,010
他想知道我们很多事
He wanted to know a lot about us.

208
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,061
我们是怎么来的  我们是否病了
How we got here. If we were sick.

209
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:18,088
你没有问过有关他的事?
You didn't ask anything about him?

210
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:20,059
他拿着枪啊
He was the one with the gun.

211
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:21,016
你还真沉得住气
You seem calm

212
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:25,016
作为一个相信世界会在45分钟后毁灭的人来说 
for someone who believes the world's going to end in 45 minutes.

213
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,046
他会修好的
He'll fix it.

214
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,015
你明白他说的,这是...
You understand that what he's saying,

215
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:33,050
这是疯狂的  是不可能的
it's insane. It's impossible.

216
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,055
为什么是疯狂的呢?
Why is it insane?

217
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:39,021
因为我上次看到那台能拯救世界的电脑时
The last time I saw the computer that would save the world,

218
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:40,091
感觉并不是现在这样的
it didn't look like that.

219
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:47,010
你这么心神不安是因为他说他认识你么?
Is the reason you're so upset because he said he recognised you?

220
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:58,019
因为那才是不可能的
Because that would be impossible.

221
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:22,098
欢迎观赏  我是Marvin Candle博士
Welcome. I'm Dr Marvin Candle,

222
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,067
这是专为达摩启动计划
and this is the orientation film

223
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:28,014
第3站制作的影片
for Station Three of the Dharma Initiative.

224
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:29,025
接下来
In a moment,

225
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:33,010
我们会对你和你的伙伴做个简要说明
you'll be given a simple set of instructions for how you and your partner

226
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,029
针对你们如何担负起这个岗位的责任
will fulfil the responsibilities associated with this station.

227
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:39,001
但是首先  还是先来看看历史介绍吧
But first, a little history.

228
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:42,063
达摩启动计划是1970年首创的
The Dharma Initiative was created in 1970

229
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:46,000
是Gerald和Karen Degroot智慧的结晶
and is the brainchild of Gerald and Karen DeGroot,

230
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,097
他们是密西根大学两位博士候选人
two doctoral candidates at the University of Michigan.

231
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:53,019
跟随着比如B.F.Skinner这样的梦想家的脚步
Following in the footsteps of visionaries such as BF Skinner...

232
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:57,016
他们描绘了一幅大规模的公共研究情景
imagined a large-scale communal research compound

233
00:18:57,066 --> 00:19:00,090
全世界的科学家和自由思想家能够从事研究
scientists and free-thinkers from around the globe could pursue research

234
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,026
在气象学
in meteorology,

235
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:04,070
心理学
psychology,

236

电磁学
electromagnetism,

239
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,081
和理想化社会研究方面的发展...丹麦的隐士工业家
and utopian social reclusive Danish industrialist

240
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:15,080
军需品巨头Alvar Hanso
and munitions magnate Alvar Hanso,

241
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,042
他的强大的经济后盾使得
whose financial backing

242
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:23,037
他们多目标的社会科学研究设施的梦想得以实现
made their dream of a multi-purpose social science research facility a reality.

243
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:27,006
你和你的伙伴从现在开始将一直在第3站或"天鹅座"上
You and your partner are currently located in Station Three, or "The Swan",

244
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:30,079
接下来的540天都将如此
and will be for the next 540 days.

245
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,010
原先的构想是想把第3站建成一个实验室
Station Three was originally constructed as a laboratory

246
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,077
在那科学家们能够研究推测
where scientists could work to understand

247
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:42,071
这岛上这块区域所发出的单一电磁波
the unique electromagnetic fluctuations emanating from this sector of the island.

248
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:46,031
但是在实验开始不久之后
Not long after the experiments began, however,

249
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:49,055
发生了一起...意外
there was...an incident.

250
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:53,090
从那时开始  下面这些协定就开始被执行了
Since that time, the following protocol has been observed.

251
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:58,071
每隔108分钟这个按键必须按下
Every 108 minutes, the button must be pushed.

252
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,047
从警报响起的那一刻开始
From the moment the alarm sounds,

253
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,025
你将有4分钟时间
you will have four minutes

254
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:06,069
把这些代码输入计算机里
to enter the code into the microcomputer processor

255
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:08,071
使之进入程序
induction into the programme.

256
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:14,047
当警报响起时  无论你或是你的伙伴必须输入代码
When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code.

257
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:18,094
我们强烈建议你和你的伙伴轮流换岗
It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts.

258
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:22,070
这样  你们就会保持时刻警觉地状态...
In this manner, you will both stay as fresh and alert utmost importance

259
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,084
在警报响起时
that when the alarm sounds,

260
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:28,090
能准确的及时的输入代码
the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion.

261
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,094
不要尝试拿电脑做任何...
Do not attempt to use the computer for anything...

262
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:37,000
祝贺你  直到你的替班到达
Congratulations! Until your replacements arrive,

263
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,094
这个计划的未来掌握在你们手上
the future of the project is in your hands.

264
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:41,079
我代表Degroots
On behalf of the DeGroots,

265
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:45,060
Alvar Hanso和达摩启动计划的全部人员
Alvar Hanso, and all of us at the Dharma Initiative,

266
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,094
对你们表示感谢
thank you,

267
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:48,038
(印度合十礼)
namaste,

268
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,085
并...

269
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:53,089
祝你们好运
good luck.

270
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:08,031
我们还得再看一遍
We're gonna need to watch that again.

271
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,050
那是什么?
What's that?

272
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,067
给你的礼物  我们认识六个月了
It's a present. It's been six months.

273
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:19,062
有几分像周年纪念  是么?
Sort of an anniversary, right?

274
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:23,093
-我没给过你什么  -没关系
-I didn't get you anything.  -That's OK.

275
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:27,055
只花了我一美元
Only cost me a buck.

276
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,097
是我家的钥匙
It's to my place.

277
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:40,050
我想你大概厌倦了老是敲门
Thought you might be tired of knocking.

278
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:45,051
呃  Helen...
Well, Helen...

279
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:49,020
我真不知道该怎么说
I don't know what to say.

280
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:53,022
只有...一个条件  John
There's just...one condition though, John.

281
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:55,067
当你来我这儿过夜时
When you stay over,

282
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,004
你就得过夜
you stay over.

283
00:21:58,004 --> 00:22:00,050
什么意思?
What do you mean?

284
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,012
我昨晚跟踪你
I followed you last night.

285
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:07,077
去了你去的那间屋子
To that house that you go to.

286
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:11,082
是你父亲的房子么?
Is it your father's house?

287
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:20,059
你为什么跟踪我  Helen? 为什么这么做?
Why would you follow me, Helen? Why would you do that?

288
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:22,099
你半夜鬼鬼祟祟的出门
You sneak off in the middle of the night.

289
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:26,080
我只是想知道你去哪儿了  我很在乎你  John
I just needed to know where you were going. I care about you,John...

290
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,079
但是我做什么是我自己的事 是我一个人的事
But what I do is my business. It's personal.

291
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,054
我在愤怒中荒废了我20年的生命
I wasted 20 years of my life being angry.

292
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:37,064
我告诉自己我得忘了它  但是我...
I told myself I would get over it, but I...

293
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:41,045
我不能独自面对
I couldn't do it alone.

294
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:46,019
我需要帮助
I needed to find help.

295
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:50,004
你帮助了我  John
You help me, John.

296
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,010
现在该我来帮你了
And I can help you.

297
00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:00,038
你只需要向我保证你以后再也不去那个地方了
You just have to promise me that you're not gonna go to that place anymore.

298
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:05,092
好吧
All right.

299
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:09,008
好吧?
All right?

300
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:36,003
你还会再来监视我么?
You're going to watch that again?

301
00:23:36,003 --> 00:23:37,063
你会么?
Aren't you?

302
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:42,034
不  John  我不会了
No, John. I'm not.

303
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:02,004
没事  没事  
OK, OK!

304
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:05,064
小姐  你还好吧?
You all right, sister?

305
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:09,079
-你们是谁?     -我们坠机了
-Who are you?     -We crashed here.

306
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:14,049
我们本来是在悉尼去洛杉矶的飞机上
We were on a plane. Sydney to Los Angeles...

307
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:16,008
什么?
What?

308
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:19,070
我们中有40多个幸存
40 of us made it.

309
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:24,086
815航班?
Flight 815?

310
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:29,062
你也是?
You were on it, too?

311
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:34,001
等等  你是在后舱的么?
What? You were in the back?

312
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,083
它在半空中断裂了  你怎么...
It broke off mid-air, how did you...

313
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:40,089
我不知道  我不知道  飞机断成了两半
I don't know, I don't know. The plane came apart

314
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,086
有人从我头上冲出来
and somebody's fricking hardside came out of the overhead

315
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:45,067
把我撞晕了
and knocked me out.

316
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:50,096
我在水下醒过来  自己游了上来
I woke up underwater and made my way to the top.

317
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:54,004
游向岸边
Swam to shore.

318
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:58,052
你这些天全靠你自己活着?
You been out here by yourself all this time?

319
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:00,070
我试着去找食物
Trying to find food.

320
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,038
一路往前走  希望能找到人
Making my way, hoping to find somebody...

321
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,043
然后  昨天  他们找到了我
And then, yesterday, they found me.

322
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:09,052
-他们是谁?  -我还等着你告诉我呢
-Who are they?  -You tell me.

323
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:16,044
你看见一个男孩了么? 10岁  他们带走了我的孩子
Did you see a boy? Ten years old? They took my son.

324
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:20,083
没有  很抱歉
No. I'm sorry.

325
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,049
我叫Ana Lucia
I'm Ana Lucia.

326
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,061
Sawyer

327
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:27,032
这是Mike
This is Mike.

328
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:31,000
这个沉默的韩国人叫Jin
The quiet Korean guy's Jin.

329
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,028
你遇到我们真的是太幸运了
We're about to be the best thing that ever happened to you.

330
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,035
为什么这么说?
How's that?

331
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:40,013
因为下次那家伙打开笼子的时候
Next time Shaft opens the cage,

332
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:45,008
他会非常非常吃惊的
he's gonna get a surprising little "howdy-doody".

333
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,068
你联系过那个制作人么?
Are you in contact with the people who made it?

334
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:57,028
那部影片  你联系过他们么?
The film. Are you in contact with anyone?

335
00:25:57,028 --> 00:26:01,004
如果我联系了你想我还会呆在这儿么?
Do you think I'd be here if I was?

336
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:04,001
你怎么会不知道坠机的事?
How is it that you didn't know about the crash?

337
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,038
还有我们?
About us?

338
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:11,028
我每隔108分钟就要按一下键
I push this button every 108 minutes.

339
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:14,043
我不太出去
I don't get out much.

340
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:17,027
那么那些接替者...
So these replacements...

341
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:22,007
Kelvin就是等接替者等死的
Kelvin died waiting for his replacements.

342
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:24,015
那么你不出去  没看见任何人
So you don't get out, you don't see anyone,

343
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,015
你的食物是哪儿来的?
where's your food come from?

344
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,047
你真的认为事情是这样的么?
You really think this is happening?

345
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:32,040
为什么不呢?
Why wouldn't it be?

346
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,097
舱门口里面印着"检疫隔离"
It says "Quarantine" on the inside of the hatch

347
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:37,067
把你封闭在这下面  让你绝得恐慌
to keep you down here, keep you scared.

348
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:39,025
但是你知道么?
But you know what?

349
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:42,052
我们在外面已经40多天了  没有人得病
We've been up there for over 40 days and no one's gotten sick.

350
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:45,027
你认为这只是真实事实的一部份么?
You think this is the only part of it that's true?

351
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:47,038
你有没有想过可能他们把你困在这儿
Did you ever think they put you here

352
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,095
每隔108分钟去按按键
to push a button every 100 minutes

353
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:50,015
只是为了看看你是不是真的会去这么做
just to see if you would?

354
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:51,092
这儿的所有一切...电脑  按键...
That the computer, the button,

355
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:56,063
只是一个心理游戏  一个实验
it's just a mind game. An experiment.

356
00:26:56,069 --> 00:27:01,099
我每天都这么想过
Every single day.

357
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:11,023
并且为了我们大家  我希望这不是真的
And for all our sakes, I hope it's not real.

358
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:15,030
但是影片说这是一个电磁站
But the film says this is an electromagnetic station.

359
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,063
我不知道你是怎么想的 兄弟
And I dunno about you, brother,

360
00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:21,002
但是每次我走过那儿的混凝土墙
but every time I walk past that concrete wall out there,

361
00:27:21,002 --> 00:27:24,074
我都会觉得难受
my fillings hurt.

362
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:29,052
好了
Right.

363
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:43,065
不  不
Oh, no!

364
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:47,012
发生什么事了?
What happened?

365
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:54,057
一切都完了
It's over.

366
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:03,001
你是什么意思 "一切都完了"?
What do you mean "It's over"?

367
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:17,042
你...你在干什么?
What...what are you doing?

368
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:18,086
你要走了么?
Are you leaving?

369
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:20,090
Desmond

370
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,074
等等
Wait.

371
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:26,057
我们可以...我们可以把电脑修好的 
We can...we can fix the computer.

372
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:27,057
Sayid马上就来了  他知道...
Sayid is coming. He knows...

373
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:30,076
帮我祝他好运
Give him my best.

374
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:40,009
等等  等等  等等 你去哪儿...
Wait, wait! Where are you...

375
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,000
你不能走
You can't leave!

376
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,009
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

377
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:49,000
能跑多远跑多远  兄弟
As far as I can run, brother.

378
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:57,029
-我们该怎么做?  -不用了
-What should we do?  -Nothing.

379
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,025
我们什么都不用做
We do nothing.

380
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:00,070
这不是真的  没一样东西是真的
It's not real. None of it's real.

381
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,010
这不是...这不是应该发生的事情
No...This isn't what was supposed to happen.

382
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,083
那什么才是应该发生的?
What was supposed to happen?

383
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,009
Jack求你了  别把我丢在这儿
Please! Don't leave me here.

384
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:11,064
再见  John
Goodbye, John.

385
00:29:11,064 --> 00:29:15,068
-你靠你自己吧  -Jack
-You're on your own.  -Jack.

386
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:46,099
该死!
Damn it!

387
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:52,019
怎么会这样?  你想怎样?  你想...
Why is this happening like this? What do you want? What do...

388
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:57,057
我应该怎么做?
What am I supposed to do?

389
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,064
Helen  你...
Helen, what...

390
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:45,097
Helen  你...你...
Helen, what..

391
00:30:45,097 --> 00:30:48,060
嘿  Helen  等等
Helen, wait.

392
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,041
Helen

393
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:51,066
不要
Don't!

394
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:54,076
Helen

395
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:57,045
你为什么这么做?
Why are you doing this?

396
00:30:57,045 --> 00:31:01,076
他不会出来的  John  因为他不在乎
He's not coming out of his house because he doesn't care.

397
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:04,093
我知道你为什么在这儿  为什么你一直来这儿
I know why you're here, why you keep coming here.

398
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:06,079
你心慌了
You're scared.

399
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,013
你还怕向前...
You're scared of moving forward,

400
00:31:09,013 --> 00:31:12,092
和我一起  和我们一起
with me, with us.

401
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:16,059
你得来个选择
You're gonna have to choose.

402
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:20,068
他还是我?
Him or me.

403
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,024
不  不  不  事情没这么简单
No, no. No, it's not that simple.

404
00:31:24,024 --> 00:31:27,086
就这么简单
Yes, it is.

405
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:31,006
我...我...
I...I...

406
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:34,003
我不能  我不能
I can't. I can't.

407
00:31:34,003 --> 00:31:38,084
来吧  你可以的  -不  我不能
Yes, you can  -No, I can't!

408
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,035
我不知该怎么做
Because you don't know

409
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:51,057
因为你不知道会发生什么
what's going to happen.

410
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,051
我们都不知道
None of us do.

411
00:31:55,051 --> 00:32:00,072
这就是我们所说的信念的飞跃  John
That's why it's called a "leap of faith", John.

412
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:05,077
你不需要一个人面对
You don't have to be alone.

413
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:26,023
Jack?

414
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:29,027
Jack

415
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,035
John?

416
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:42,042
老天...
Dude...

417
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,099
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

418
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:48,088
John  Jack在哪儿?
John, where's Jack?

419
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:50,057
Jack走了
Jack's gone.

420
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:53,088
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

421
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,056
是怎么样一个东西?
What does it look like?

422
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:01,026
是一个断路器  这里肯定有
It's a breaker box. There has to be one.

423
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:03,003
顺着导线管找
Follow the conduit lines.

424
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:06,073
行  好的  导线管是什么?
Cool, OK. Great. What's a conduit line?

425
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:10,063
就是那些管子  沿着他们找
Those tubes. Follow those.

426
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:26,090
你找到它了么?
Did you find it?

427
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:34,016
就看你说的"它"是指什么了
Depends what you mean by "it".

428
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:41,029
好了  我们就这么做
Here's what we do.

429
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:43,001
Jin假装死了  你喊救命
Jin plays dead. You call for help.

430
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:45,043
病了的囚犯?  你是认真的?
Sick prisoner? You serious?

431
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:48,072
那么你有更好的主意了  亲爱的?
What, you got a better idea, sweetheart?

432
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:50,035
你是怎么拿到枪的?
Where'd you get that gun, anyway?

433
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:51,019
什么?
What?

434
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,028
那把枪  你怎么在飞机上得到的?
The gun, how'd you get it on the plane?

435
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:56,002
飞机上有个军官
There was a federal marshal on the plane.

436
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:59,008
然后呢  你碰巧得到了这把枪?
So, what? You just happened to have his gun?

437
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:03,041
是的  我很幸运  Mike...
Yeah. I'm lucky. Mike, let's get this thing going.

438
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,034
他们抓你们的时候你为什么不用?
How come you didn't use it when they grabbed you?

439
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:13,037
当时一直挨着棍子揍
Guess I was too busy getting hit in the face with a club.

440
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,063
你怎么突然这么感兴趣了  小妞?
Why are you suddenly so interested, cupcake?

441
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:19,000
-嘿  -什么?

他们是谁?
Who are they?

449

停下!
Stop!

450
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:25,031

00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:27,033
那些数字  是么?
The code, yeah?

452
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:28,041
什么?
What?

453
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,085
仔细听着
Listen carefully.

454
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,025
如果出现了奇迹 你们把电脑又修好了
If by some miracle you get that computer working again,

455
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:36,016
你们得输入这些数字 4,8,15,16,23,42
enter the code. 4,8,15,16,23,42

456
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:37,019
按下"执行"键
Hit "Execute. "

457
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:40,072
-再说一遍  4  8  15  16...  -闭嘴
-Again. 4,8,15,16...  -Shut up!

458

什么?
Sorry?

459
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:44,005
不会有事发生的
Nothing is going to happen.

460
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:49,001
那些人把你困在下面  给你看一部片子
Some... man takes you down there, shows you a movie,

461
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:52,041
然后你就凭着信念一个人按那个按键
and you push a button on faith alone?

462
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:56,053
不会有事发生的
Nothing is going to happen!

463
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:00,012
是对是错15分钟后就会有结论了  兄弟
In about 15 minutes, you're either gonna be very right or very wrong.

464
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:03,002
你想向我开枪?  开枪吧 我是不会闲在这儿的
You wanna shoot me? Shoot me. I'm not...

465
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:08,039

Why are you running? You don't even know what you're running from!

466
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:14,020

467
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,058

你是一个医生  是么? 有个女孩
You're a doctor, right? There was this girl,

473
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,028
你很为她担心  你说...
you were worried, you said...

474
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:34,082
你说她的手术失败了
You said you failed her.

475
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:38,048
-就是你  -这不重要
-That was you.  -It doesn't matter.

476
00:36:38,048 --> 00:36:42,095
-她还好么?  那个女孩?  -这不重要
-Was she OK? The girl?  -It doesn't matter.

477
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:44,098
-她怎么样了?  -这不重要
-What happened?  -It doesn't matter.

478
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:50,050
-你怎么能说这不重...        -我娶了她
-How can you say it doesn't...      -I married her!

479
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,076
好的
Right.

480
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,081
那你...
Then, you're...

481
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:09,080
你不再是他的丈夫了
You're not married to her anymore, then.

482
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:35,041
那么在新生活中再见了
See you in another life, yeah?

483
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:53,036
你能修好么?

这个人  不管他是谁  换掉了主板

电源变压器烧了

你难道不想知道为什么吗?
Don't you need to know why?

487
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:09,026
我要知道的只是这只计时器在为了什么倒数
All I need to know is that the timer is counting down to something,

488
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:13,003
并且为什么电脑得尽快修好
and that this computer needs to be repaired.

What is this thing? We don't even know what it does! I mean, we need...

506
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:20,049

算了  继续吧  该干什么干什么
Forget it. Go ahead. Do your thing.

509
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:30,070

It's not 32.

510
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:35,060
应该是42
It's 42.

511
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:37,082
他刚和我说的  Desmond
He just told me. Desmond.

512
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:40,080
最后一个数是42
The last number's 42.

513
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,093

514
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:47,010

519

不  你看了影片了  Jack

520
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:26,006
这是...这至少是是两个人的工作
This is...this is a two-person job at least.

521
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,051
这个争辩毫无来由
This argument is irrelevant.

522
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,084
Sayid不要  Jack...
Sayid. Don't. Jack.

523

If it's not real,then why are you here?

526
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,055
你为什么回来?
Why did you come back?

527
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:41,078
怎么就这么难以让你相信呢?
Why do you find it so hard to believe?

你还是按了吧
Maybe you should just do it.

530
00:40:57,026 --> 00:40:59,095
不
No.

531
00:40:59,095 --> 00:41:03,019
只是个按键
It's a button.

532
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:08,002
我不能一个人这么做  Jack
I can't do this alone, Jack.

533
00:41:09,062 --> 00:41:13,024
我不想这样
I don't want to.

534
00:41:15,003 --> 00:41:19,055
这是信念的飞跃  Jack
It's a leap of faith, Jack.

535
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,081
