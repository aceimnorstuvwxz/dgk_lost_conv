Juliet  她是他们的妇产医生

专门研究怀孕女性的

6
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:35,035
他们想要她孩子的原因是为了研究
The reason the others wanted her baby was for research.

7
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:38,049
-在这个岛上女人怀孕会怎样?  -她们会死
-What happens to pregnant women on this island? Does the--- -they die.

你想让我帮你和你的孩子

我要去看看你的孩子

然后决定妊娠日期
And determine the date of conception.

13
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,063
如果你是在这里怀孕的...
If you got pregnant here...

14
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,025
我们还是要面对现实  渡过难关
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

15
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,024
这个孩子是大概八个星期之前怀上的
The baby was conceived about eight weeks ago.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,081
你是在岛上怀孕的
You got pregnant on the island.

17
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:02,096
那我还剩多少时间?
So how long do I have?

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,042
大多数女性
Most of the women made it

19
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:08,004
能到五  六个月左右
Into the middle of their second trimester.

20

Frank
Frank.

27

我没注意到你
I didn't hear you.

28
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:08,015
抱歉  我不是故意吓你的

00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:11,082
-船长想让我带点食物给这些人  -好
-Captain wanted me to bring these guys some grub. -okay.

30
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:16,077
你瞧  你的书拿反了
You know, your book's upside-down.

31
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,029
我只是想帮下忙
Just tryin' to help.

32
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:35,018
我过来登记一下  拿点食物给你们
I thought I'd check in on you guys, bring you some food.

33
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:37,032
顺便问问  你们感觉如何?
How you feeling, by the way?

34
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,088
-好多了 谢谢  -我们为什么被关起来?
Yeah, much better, thanks. why are we being held captive?

35
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:43,029
我们和Minkowski的死一点关系也没有
We had nothing to do with minkowski's death.

36
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:45,020
这个和Minkowski一点关系也没有
This has nothing to do with minkowski.

37
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:47,058
船长对你们俩逃出医务室
The captain wasn't very happy that you two decided

38
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:49,074
进入我们的无线电室感到很不高兴
To bust out of sick bay and into our radio room.

39
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:52,015
我们没想跑  那个门本来就是开着的
We didn't bust out. The door was left open.

40
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:55,035
我们觉得是你开的门
We assumed it was you.

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,083
我干嘛要那么做?
Why the hell would I do that?

42
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:00,087
你和我们在海滩上的人还有什么联系吗?
Did you have any contact with our people on the beach?

43
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:04,006
运气不好  他们的电话肯定出了问题
No luck. Something must've happened to their phone.

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,058
利马豆?
Lima beans?

45
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,042
抱歉  我们厨房出了点小问题
Sorry. We had a little problem in the kitchen.

46
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:15,042
呆在这  明白吗?
Just stay put, all right?

47
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:19,030
我还是想和船长谈谈
I still want to talk to the captain.

48
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,064
不  不行
No, you don't.

49
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:27,014
Regina
Regina.

50
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,046
怎么了?
What's wrong?

51
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:46,026
Sayid和Desmond三天前离开的
Sayid and Desmond left three days ago.

52
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:48,062
为什么他们还没有回来?
Why haven't they come back?

53
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,082
也许他们正和船一起回来
Perhaps they are returning with the ship.

54
00:03:58,087 --> 00:03:59,086
来吧
Now come on...

55
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,055
我们还有更重要的事情要说
We have more important things to talk about.

56
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:06,017
比如说?
Like what?

57
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,057
让我们来说说孩子的名字
Let's talk about baby names.

58
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:13,016
很好  你说得越来越好了
Good. you're getting better.

59
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,030
不过 不  Jin
Hmm. But, no, Jin.

60
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:18,059
现在讨论孩子的名字会带来厄运
It's bad luck to talk about baby names now.

61
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,070
你还迷信?
Superstitious?

62
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:24,097
我不想让他倒霉
I don't want to Jinx him.

63
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,075
你是说她吧
You mean her.

64
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,066
会是个女孩  是吗?
Oh, it's going to be a girl, is it?

65
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:33,015
Ji Yeon
Ji Yeon.

66
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,029
我想叫她Ji Yeon
I want to name her Ji Yeon.

67
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,022
我不想说名字的事
I don't want to talk about names.

68
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,024
你不喜欢Ji Yeon这个名字?
You don't like Ji Yeon?

69
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:44,052
不  这个名字很好
No, it's beautiful.

70
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,020
我会告诉你的
I'll tell you what.

71
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,040
不过我们得先离开这个岛
Let's get off the island first.

72
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,076
然后我们再挑选个名字
Then we can pick a name.

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,038
一言为定
Deal.

74
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:49,009
紧急通信
Emergency services.

75
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,022
我需要救护车...
I need an ambulance...

76
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:56,005
大概是什么问题?
What seems to be the problem?

77
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,022
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant...

78
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:00,002
我现在觉得出了点问题
and I think something's wrong.

79
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,083
需要帮忙吗?
Can I help you?

80
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,061
你在找什么吗?
Is there something you're looking for?

81
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:01,007

给我这个
Give me that one.

85

你想把礼物包起来吗?
Would you like it gift wrapped?

86
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:21,040
不用了  我还得去医院

87

00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:23,038
五万
Fifty thousand won.

89
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:26,008
要去妇产病房?
Maternity ward?

90
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,028
为什么不早说?
Why didn't you say so?

91
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,092
你应该非常高兴才对

92
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,042

93
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:37,026
我还不知道呢
I...I don't know yet.

94
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:38,035

00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:09,075
发生什么了?
What happened?

104
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,094
你想说在那个红发女袭击我之前还是之后?
You mean before or after the redhead knock me out?

105
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,048
她打了你?
She hit you?

106
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:19,041
我从Lock的营地往回跑时碰上了她
When I ran into them on my way back from Locke's camp.

107
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,027
她什么要那样做?
Why would she do that?

108
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,090
我想她不会想去解释
I guess she didn't wannhave to explain

109
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,026
她为什么要去一个毒气工厂
Why she was on her way to a poison gas factory.

110
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,012
Juliet告诉Jack说那是个发电站
Juliet told Jack that it was a power station.

111
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,052
Juliet为什么要说谎?
Why would julietie about that?

112
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,000
习惯使然?
Force of habit?

113
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:39,004
他们为什么要去那里?
Why were they going there?

114
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:42,004
关掉它  关闭毒气
To turn it off, to deactivate the gas.

115
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:44,020
我猜他们是去赚女童子军学分
I guess they wanted to earn some brownie points.

116
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,004
你觉得他们真的会救我们吗?
Do you think they're really going to rescue us?

117
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:51,041
他们在这里这么久
In all the time they've been here,

118
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,088
说了很多事情
They've talked about a lot of things,

119
00:08:53,038 --> 00:08:56,013
不过没有一件是关于救我们的
And none involved rescuing us.

120
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,095

Good morning.

121
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:21,038

123
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,001
Sayid
Sayid.

124
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,033
那是什么?
What's that?

125
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,025
一张便签
It's a note.

126
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,078
三天前
Three days ago,

127
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,042
我在Locke的营地时

128
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:53,064
Ben说他在船上有个间谍
Ben claimed he had a spy on this boat.

129
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,032
别相信船长
Don't trust captain

130
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,073
你好
Hello.

需要帮忙吗?
Something I can help you with?

134
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:28,026
我怀孕两个月了
I'm two months pregnant.

135
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:31,055
噢  你...

138
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:38,002
那你是来救我们的吗?
So are you here to rescue us?

139
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,091
这不难回答
It's a simple question.

140
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:47,004
到底是  还是不是?
Are you or are you not going to rescue us?

141
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,007
这个...
The thing is, ...

142
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,023
实际上也不是我说了算  sun
It's not really my call, sun.

143
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:59,004
那谁说了算?
Then whose call is it?

144
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:04,072
谢谢
Thank you.

我不会去找什么借口的
And I have no excuse.

290
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,090
请听我解释啊
Please let me explain.

291
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:18,006
你听我解释啊
let me explain.

292
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,083
Jin...
Jin...

293
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,097
嘿  你去钓鱼吗
Hey. you are fishing?

294
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:27,081
嗯  你介意我一起去吗
Uh, do you mind if i... tag along?

295
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:35,026
对不起  我不是故意打扰你们的
Oh, I am sorry. i-i didn't mean to interrupt.

296
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,020
没有  一起去吧
No. come.

297
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,000
你说真的?
You sure?

298
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:43,067
一起吧
Come.

299
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:09,054
你发现了吗？我们是这个岛上唯一的两对夫妇
You realize we're the only two married guys on the island?

300
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:13,003
结过婚的
Married.

301
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:15,087
结过婚的
Married.

302
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,063
不  不是说我们  不是
Yeah, well, no, not to each other. no.

303
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,026
你应该明白的
You got it.

304
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:23,038
很不容易  对吧
It's not easy, iit?

305
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,087
我的意思是   很奇妙
Oh, I mean, it's--it's wonderful,

306
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:27,096
但是  让我们面对现实
But... let's face it.

307
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,009
做每个决定你都得花两倍的时间
Every decision that you make takes twice as long

308
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,069
因为你总得说服她们
Cause you always gotta talk them into it.

309
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:42,059
得了癌症
Has cancer.

310
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:47,007
她病得厉害
She's sick.

311
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,014
快死了
Dying.

312
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:52,075
至少她之前快不行了
Well, at least, she was dying.

313
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,084
她说她现在好点了
She says she's better now.

314
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,086
她说是因为这个地方...
She says it's this place...

315
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:01,005
这个岛  让她好起来
The island.

316
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,027
但当我们内部开始分裂得时候
But when the camp split up,

317
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,021
我知道她肯定会跟着Locke走
I was sure that she'd want to go with locke.

318
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,074
她怎么会愿意冒再次生病得危险
Why would she want to leave the island

319
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,065
离开这座岛呢？
And risk getting sick again?

320
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,006
那你为什么还要Jack这边?
Uh, then why do you stay with jack?

321
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,099
因为这样做是对的
Because it was the right thing to do.

322
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,089
Locke?
Locke?

323
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,060
他是个杀人犯
He's a murderer.

324
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:32,088
看到了吧  这些全是因果报应  Jin
See, it's all about karma, jin.

325
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:35,000
你知道什么是因果报应吗
Do you know karma?

326
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,089
你做了不好的选择  不好的事情就会发生
You make bad choices, bad things happen to you.

327
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:42,029
但如果你做了正确的选择  好的事情就会发生
But you make good choices, and then good--

328
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,029
你钓到了一条
Hey! hey, hey, hey! you got one.

329
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,006
就在那儿  使劲拉
Yeah. here, pull it .

330
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:49,069
哇  看看
Wow, look at that!

331
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:52,059
看到了吗?  这就是因果报应
Ah, you see? now that's karma.

332
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:56,039
我们肯定都是好人  对吧
We must be the good guys, huh?

333
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:13,054
还要等多久啊？
How long's that gonna go on for, eh?

334
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:17,021
他妈的  他们就找出是什么故障原因吗？
Can't they just fix whatever the bloody hell's causing that?

335
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:19,023
那不是机器发出的声音
That sound is not mechanical.

336
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,086
什么  你认为是有人故意弄出的声音
What, you think somebody's doing that?

337
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:24,057
有人在那管子上敲来敲去？
Somebody's just banging those pipes again and again?

338
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:25,082
就是这样
That's exactly what I think.

339
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,048
先生们
Gentlemen...

340
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,045
谢谢你们的耐心
Thanks for your patience.

341
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:35,086
船长现在能见你们了
The captain would like to see you now.

342
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:53,093
直升机哪去了?
Where's the helicopter?

343
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,002
Lapidus开去执行任务去了
Lapidus is running an errand.

344
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,089
什么任务
What kind of errand?

345
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:00,023
我只是个医生  我不知道他去哪儿了
I'm a doctor. I don't know where he's going.

346
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,091
他回岛上了?
Did he go to the island?

347
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:04,066
你认为他还有什么地方可以去吗
You know anywhere else he could land?

348
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,031
他去做什么
What's he going to do?

349
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,057
我说了  我只是个医生
I said I'm just a doctor.

350
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:11,013
Lapidus有留下什么话吗?
What did lapidus say?

351
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:15,066
-他什么都没说  -她在干什么
He didn't say anything. what is she doing?!

352
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:23,093
那个女人刚刚从船上跳下去了
That woman just jumped over the side of the ship!

353
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:28,025
别傻站在那  你们他妈的怎么了？
Don't just stand there! what's the matter with you people?!

354
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:32,017
拿绳子来  你们怎么都不动啊  拿绳子来
Get a rope! why aren'tou doing anything?! bring a rope!

355
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,024
绳子!  拿绳子!
Get a rope! get a pe!

356
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:36,083
-好了  -她刚刚跳下去了
Stop! she just jumped!

357
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,099
结束了  她已经死了
It's over. she's gone.

358
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:41,099
每个人都回到自己的岗位去
Everybody get back to your posts.

359
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,051
这是命令
That was an order.

360
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,022
我是Gault船长
I'm captain gault.

361
00:24:58,022 --> 00:25:00,013
我猜你们两个有点想不通吧
I suppose you two have a few questions.

362
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:10,050
-我有什么能帮你们  -什么?
So what can I do for you? what?

363
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:13,025
-你们说想跟我谈谈  -就从刚才那事说起
You boys said you wanted to speak with me. let's just start with

364
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:16,021
为什么一个女人跳海了却没有人去阻止她
Why a woman jumped over side of your ship,and you did nothing to stop it

365
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:19,047
我没有跳也没有命令我的船员跳
I didn't jump or order my crew to jump in

366
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:22,028
因为我不想再失去更多人
Because I didn't want to lose any more peoe.

367
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:25,081
这里到底发生了什么
What exactly is going on here?

368
00:25:28,056 --> 00:25:30,098
我的一些船员感染了一种
Some of my crew has been dealing with...

369
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,096
怎么说呢
What might best be described

370
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,020
一种叫幽居病的病
As a heightened case of cabin fever.

371
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,098
我认为这跟靠近这个岛屿的原因有关
I think it's got something to do

372
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,007
那为什么你不掉头？
With the close proximity of the island. why don't you turn around, then?

373
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,078
我试过了  但是有个船上有个破坏者
I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board,

374
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:48,019
他在引擎上做了手脚
And he's de one hell a job on my engines.

375
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,021
我已经叫我的船员加班加点地去维修了
I've got my creworking around the clock to repair them.

376
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,013
然后你就会带我们的人回去？
And then you'll take our people home?

377
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,029
然后我们转移到安全的水域
Then we move to safer waters.

378
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,078
这是我所有的命令
That all are my orders.

379
00:25:57,078 --> 00:26:00,033
你大概不会告诉我们  谁下了这些命令？
And I don't suppose you'll tell us who gave you those orders?

380
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:02,097
当然会  是Charles Widmore
Sure, I ll. charles widmore.

381
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:08,054
这是Charles Widmore的船？
This is charles widmore's boat?

382
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:12,006
对  你认识他的
That's right. you know him.

383
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:30,041
你们有人知道这是什么吗?
Do either of you know what this is?

384
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:34,057
是一个飞行数据记录器  就是俗话说的黑匣子
It's a flight data recorder, otherwise known as a black box.

385
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:37,016
对  就是黑匣子
That's exactly what it is.

386
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:39,076
有意思的是
Now here's the funny thing.

387
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:44,060
这是大洋航空815航班上的黑匣子
This black box comes from oceanic flight 8-1-5.

388
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:51,038
一艘打捞船从海底打捞出来的
A salvage vessel recovered it from the bottom of the ocean.

389
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:55,072
Widmore先生耗费了大量的人力财力
It took a considerable amount of mr. widmore's resources

390
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:56,063
才搞到手
To procure it.

391
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,090
这个黑匣子是在一起空难中发现
It was found with the wreckage of the plane,

392
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:02,047
324名乘客全部死亡
Along with all 324 dead passengers.

393
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,088
然而故事还没完
That's not the complete story,

394
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:09,065
你们都清楚 Jarrah先生
As you are well aware, mr. jarrah,

395
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:12,082
你们活生生地站在这里
Given the fact that you're standing here, breathing.

396
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:17,044
那次空难很明显是计划好的
The wreckage was obviously staged.

397
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:21,030
现在你们可以想象一下
Now can you imagine what kind of resources and manpower

398
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,071
花了多少人力物力才制造了这个假象
Go into pulling off a feat of that magnitude?

399
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,039
空难的假象
Faking the recovery of a plane crash?

400
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:31,056
让324个家庭因为一个谎言
Putting 324 families through a grieving process

401
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:33,005
痛不欲生?
Based on a lie?

402
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,021
但是更烦人的事
But what's even more disturbing--

403
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:39,051
到底在哪里才能让一个人
Where exactly does one come across

404
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:42,010
发现324个人的尸体
324 dead bodies?

405
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:46,035
Jarrah先生  Hume先生
And that, mr. jarrah, mr. hume,

406
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,078
那  就是我们要找到Benjamin Linus
Is just one of the many reasons

407
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,069
的原因之一
We want benjamin linus.

408
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:04,057
对不起
I'm sorry.

409
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:10,066
我不得不想尽办法来阻止你
I had to stop you any way I could.

410
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:15,049
这不是你的地盘  你没权阻止我
It wasn't your place to stop us

411
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:17,041
我知道你不相信我
I know you don't trust me,

412
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:20,055
但是你需要离开这座岛  我们都需要
But you need tget off is island. we all do.

413
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:22,066
你想离开？
You want to leave?

414
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,019
做梦都想
More than anything.

415
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:29,080
我不知道那边那艘船能不能带我们离开
I don't know if that boat out there is the answer or not,

416
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,094
但总有一丝希望
But it's something.

417
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,070
我需要回家
I need to go home.

418
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:36,075
你也是
So do you.

419
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:38,086
Sun
Sun...

420
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:42,067
再接下来的三周里
In about three weeks,

421
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,015
你会不断的出现想呕吐的现象
You'll be in an almost constant state of nausea.

422
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,036
在那之后的一周里  你会感觉到呼吸急促
A week after that, you will experience shortness of breath

423
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:49,052
并且会持续很久
That won't go away.

424
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,015
在那之后的又一周  你会失去意识
A week after that, you will lose consciousness

425
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,045
并且昏迷
And slip into a coma.

426
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,063
再之后  Sun  你会死的
And then, sun, you will die.

427
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,001
当你的心脏停止跳动时
And when your heart stops beating...

428
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,099
肚子里的孩子也活不了了
So will the baby's.

429
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:11,079
Sun  这就是我为什么要阻止你
And that, sun, is why it is my business,

430
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,040
因为你是我的病人
Because you are my patient.

431
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,035
如果你真的去了
If you go...

432
00:29:20,078 --> 00:29:22,015
你会死的
You will die...

433
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:27,047
然后你的孩子就没了
And your baby will never be born.

434
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:39,062
我得做个破腹产
I have to perform a C-section

435
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:40,058
不要
No

436
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:42,084
你不知道
You don't understand...

437
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:46,094
使用药物就很难顺产的
The medication makes a natural birth difficult

438
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:49,034
不  不行  要等到JIN...
No, no! Not until Jin

439
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,082
我们必须做手术了
We've got to get to surgery!

440
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:52,009
我的丈夫在哪里
Where's my husband?

441
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:53,031
他还没到
He's not here yet.

442
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:55,035
我们不能等了
We cannot wait

443

婴儿的头出来了

447
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:05,075
好的 sun  你现在要开始使劲了
Okay, Sun. You need to push now.

448
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:17,018
对  就这样  使劲  使劲

是个女孩
You have a baby daughter.

454
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:35,040
你觉得船长怎样?
So what'd you think of the captain?

455
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,085
出奇的友好
He was surprisingly forthcoming.

456
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:41,056
还真是那么回事  别让他溜了
Yeah, he tell it like it is. just don't piss him off.

457
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,002

我想你会喜欢你的房间的

459

在船上算是安静的地方了

460
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,070
这船没动
Th ship isn't moving.

461
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:50,055
好吧  如果你非要这么说
Well, if you say so.

462
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:03,080
那玩意儿怎么还在那  该死
That shouldn't still be there. damn it.

463

473
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:30,065

都是他造成的

我们必须离开这个岛
