你怎么知道的?

00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:45,406
因为 此事曾在你妹妹身上发生过

21
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:48,157
他们说棺材在柏林过了安检
and they think the coffin was checked through Berlin.

22
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:49,367
你怎么会把遗体搞丢呢?
How do you lose a body?

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,130
我不知道 妈妈 但我们无能为力
I don't know, mom, but there's nothing we can do

24
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:54,497
- 只能继续等消息  - 我等不下去 Jack
- except for wait for more information.  - I don't want to wait, Jack.

25
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:56,676
这叫我怎么去完成葬礼?
How am I supposed to get anything done?

26

我甚至连他的遗嘱都找不到 到处都是纸
I can't even find his will. Papers everywhere.

好吧
Okay.

30
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:09,679
好 还有 妈妈 我的阑尾是什么时候切除的?
Good. Now, mom, when did I have my appendix taken out?

31
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,817
大概在你七八岁的时候吧
You were 7 or 8 maybe.

32
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:13,985
你上学的时候痛晕了过去

你爸本来想自己主刀的
Your father wanted to do the procedure himself,

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,449
但他们不让 你不记得这事了么?
but they wouldn't let him. You don't remember that?

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,741
不 我...
Yeah, I...

36
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:22,326
我想我记得的
I guess I do.

37
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:26,893
哦 要命 妈妈 我得走了
Oh, damn it. Mom, I gotta go.

38
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,926
哦 别忘了...

我怕你走了
I was afraid you'd left.

46
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:29,856
我有选择离开的权力吗?
Is leaving an option?

47
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:31,826
凡事皆有选择
Everything is an option.

48
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,475
但我会阻止你的
But I would have to stop you.

49
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,033
嗯 我就欣赏你的坦诚

然后记点儿东西

124

像历史啊...

126
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:51,935
还有像"夺宝奇兵"里那些东西

127
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,259
你不该来这儿
You shouldn't be here.

128
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,282

Why don't you go back to the courtyard?

135
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:35,577
他说了什么?
What'd he say?

136
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:38,163
你不会想知道的 你在这儿干嘛 Hugo?
You don't want to know. What are you doing here, Hugo?

137
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:39,299
正想穿过这条秘道

You ever tried to get Jack to do something? It's, like, impossible.

- I can just go myself.  - You have to bring him with you, Hugo.

141
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,560
好吧 你让我记下这么多东西 已经够糟糕的了
Okay, it's bad enough you already made me write down

142
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:52,625
我刚刚还对一个日本武士撒了谎
way too much stuff, and I just lied to a samurai.

143
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:55,185
听着 要是你有什么主意 能让Jack
Look, if you have any idea on how to get Jack

144
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,531
去干你的小探险 那就说啊 老兄
to go on your little adventure, I'm listening, dude.

145
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,420
保持镇定 伙计
Be cool, man.

146
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:13,036
表现得自然点
Act natural.

147
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:14,975
什么?
What?

148
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:17,207
老兄 声音小点
Dude, keep your voice down.

149
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,026
我等下会站起来 离开
I'm gonna get up and go.

150
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:22,164
十秒之后 跟上我
Wait ten seconds and then follow me.

151
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,814
跟着你去哪儿?
Follow you where?

152
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:28,473
我找到了一条通往丛林的秘道
I found a secret tunnel that leads out to the jungle.

153
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,579
你找到一条秘道?
You found a secret tunnel?

154
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:34,229
嗯... 是Jacob告诉我的
Well... Jacob told me about it.

155
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:38,462
- 他说我们俩得去...  - 我哪儿都不去 Hurley
- He said you and me have to go...  - I'm not going anywhere, Hurley.

156
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,908
我告诉过他 你肯定会这么说的 所以他叫我告诉你...
I told him you'd say that, so he told me to tell you...

157
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:46,350
你身上有玄机
You have what it takes.

158
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,600
你刚刚说什么?
What did you just say?

159
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,018
我说 "你身上有玄机"
I said, "you have what it takes,"

160
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,185
他说 你知道这是什么意思
He said you'd know what that meant.

161
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,644
- 他在哪儿?  - 什么?
- Where is he?  - What?

162
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:05,103
Jacob 他在哪儿?
Jacob. Where is he?

163
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,263
他相当于死人一个
He's kind of dead.

164
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,798
他想出现时就会出现 就像Obi-Wan Kenobi("星际大战"中的绝地武士)
He turns up whenever he wants, like Obi-Wan Kenobi.

165
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:16,135
不过如果你想跟他谈谈 他就在我们要去的地方 老兄
But if you wanna talk to him, he's where we're going, dude.

166
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:21,651
好吧 那我们去找Jacob
Well, then let's go see Jacob.

167
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:40,900
Claire啊?
Claire?

168
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,829
好了 看我抓到了谁... 是其中一个想杀你的人
Well, look what I found... one of the men who tried to kill you.

169
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,893
他只是装死 实际上根本没死
He was just pretending to be dead, but he wasn't.

170
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:33,666
现在我们得和他谈谈
Now we get to talk to him.

171
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,517
你想和我谈什么?
You wanna talk to me about what?

172
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:44,031
谈谈你们把我儿子藏哪儿了
About where you're hiding my son.

173
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,752
得帮你清洗干净
Gotta get that cleaned up.

174
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,087
如果说在这儿 有什么能要你的命的话
If there's one thing that'll kill you around here,

175
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,318
那就是感染了
it's infection.

176
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,562
我马上回来 别乱走动 好吗?
I'll be right back. Don't move, okay?

177
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:06,480
Claire啊?
Claire?

178
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:10,410
你一直在这儿... 就你一个人吗?
Have you been out here all this time... by yourself?

179
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:12,151
哦 我... 我不是一个人
Oh, I'm... I'm not by myself.

180
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:22,703
听着 我们得马上离开这儿
Look, we've gotta get out of here now.

181
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,356
没事的 我了解她
It's okay. I know her.

182
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,462
不 我才了解她
No, I know her.

183
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,923
你不知道她要怎么对我们吗?
You have any idea what she's gonna do to us?

184
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:38,167
如果我们不马上离开 她会把我们俩都杀了
If we don't get out of here now, she's gonna kill us both.

185
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,799
走哪边?
Which way?

186
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:55,563
走这边
It's this way.

187
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,605
哇! 嘿!
Whoa! Hey!

188
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:08,680
是我
It's me.

189
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:12,611
是Jack!
Jack!

190
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:14,540
我差点开了枪
I almost shot you.

191
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:17,253
我注意到了 你在这儿干嘛?
I noticed. What are you doing out here?

192
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,140
呃 Jin和Sawyer人呢?
Where's, uh, where's Jin and Sawyer?

193
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,705
Jin回寺庙去了 嗯...
Jin went back to the temple, and, um...

194
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:23,780
Sawyer独自走了
Sawyer's on his own.

195
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,536
嘿 Kate 有一个暗门可以回寺庙
Hey, Kate, there's a secret door to get back in the temple,

196
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:30,673
就在大树后的北墙上
on the north wall behind the big tree.

197
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:32,393
嗯 我不准备回寺庙
Yeah, I'm not going back to the temple.

198
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,364
我要去找Claire
I'm going to find Claire.

199
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,471
- Kate...  - 我准备回海滩营地
- Kate...  - I'm going back to the beach camp.

200
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,630
- 她也许还在那儿 Jack  - Kate 她不在海滩那儿
- She might still be there, Jack.  - Kate, she's not up at the beach.

201
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:44,770
寺庙那儿的人说她...
The people at the temple said that something...

202
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:46,731
她出了点事
something happened to her.

203
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,798
- 他们知道她在哪儿吗?  - 我不知道 他们没说
- Do they know where she is?  - I don't know. They didn't say.

204
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:56,459
我... 我得找到她
I... I have to find her.

205
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,002
Kate 等会儿 等会儿
Kate, wait. Wait.

206
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:00,567
跟我们一起 然后我们一起回寺庙
Come with us, and then we'll all go back to the temple together.

207
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:03,914
老兄 Jacob说了只有我和你
Dude, Jacob said just you and me.

208
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:05,697
没邀请她
She's kinda not invited.

209
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,199
我正邀请她呢
I'm inviting her.

210
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,796
Jack 没事 去吧 没关系
Jack, it's okay. Just go. It's all right.

211
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:13,664
我希望 你能找到你想找的东西
I hope you find what you're looking for.

212
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,260
我们永远找不到了
We're never going to find it.

213
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,533
别激动 妈
Take it easy, Mom.

214
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,774
他就在这儿的某个地方 我们会找到的
It's somewhere in here, and we'll find it.

215
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,506
简直就是大海捞针
It's like a needle in a damned haystack.

216
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:47,873
你爸干嘛不直接把遗嘱给律师
Why your father wouldn't just give his will to his lawyer

217
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,843
如果他不想给我的话?
he's beyond me?

218
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,827
好了... 他干嘛要让我们这时候 无所事事呢?
Well... Why would he make it easier on us now?

219
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:57,320
想喝杯酒吗?
You want a drink?

220
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,761
呃 不了 谢谢
Uh, no. No, no thanks.

221
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:02,815
你能这样就好
Good for you.

222
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,207
David恢复得还好吗?
How's David holding up?

223
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,689
什么?
What?

224
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,649
葬礼上他非常不安
He was really upset at the funeral.

225
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:15,995
是吗?
He was?

226
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:17,820
他没告诉你?
He didn't tell you?

227
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:20,468
不 不 他没有
No. No, he didn't.

228
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:23,628
他不善于交流
Communication is not one of his strong suits.

229
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:26,349
嗯 遗传你的性格
Well, it runs in the family.

230
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,456
你像David那么大时
When you were David's age,

231
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:30,697
你要是
your father was lucky

232
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,523
能多跟你爸爸说一句话 就很难得了
if he could get more than one word out of you at a time.

233
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:35,744
嗯 那是因为我害怕他 妈妈
that's because I was terrified of him, mom.

234
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,320
那你怎么知道 David就不怕你呢?
How do you know David isn't terrified of you?

235
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,430
他为什么要怕我?
Why would he be?

236
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:46,922
我不知道 Jack
I don't know, Jack.

237
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:49,310
也许 你该亲自问问他
Maybe you should ask him.

238
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,371
找到了
Found it.

239
00:17:58,696 --> 00:17:59,926
"临终遗嘱"
"Last will and testament."

240
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:15,358
Jack啊?
Jack?

241
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:17,433
嗯?
Yeah?

242
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,655
你父亲曾经提到过
Did you father ever mention

243
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:22,741
一个... 叫Claire Littleton的人吗?
a... Claire Littleton?

244
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:51,863
喂 嘿
Ow psst. Hey.

245
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,668
在她回来之前 快帮我松绑
Untie me before she comes back in.

246
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:55,545
我为什么要这么做?
Why would I do that?

247
00:18:56,765 --> 00:19:00,070
你没听到我的话吗? 她会把我们俩都杀死的
Are you not listening to me? She's gonna kill us both.

248
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:03,772
给我把绳子解开 然后 她一进来
Loosen my ropes, and when she comes back in,

249
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:05,544
我就掐断她的脖子
I'll snap her neck.

250
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,455
嗯...
So...

251
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:16,316
我 呃 很抱歉 我布下的陷阱伤了你
I'm, uh, really sorry you got stuck in my trap.

252
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,569
现在 我要帮你清洗一下 好吗?
Gonna get you all cleaned up now, okay?

253
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,116
很好 你做得很好
It's all right. You're doing good.

254
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,827
嗯 至少 你不用亲自缝合伤口
Well, at least you don't have to stitch yourself up.

255
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:30,570
我曾经自己缝过一次 他们打中了我这里
I did that once. They shot me right here.

256
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:34,396
我们走后 你就一直住在这儿?
You've been living here since we left?

257
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,523
不是一直在这儿
Not always here.

258
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,246
我 呃 为了躲避他们 不得不时常转移
I, um, had to move around quite a lot to hide from them.

259
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,381
很幸运 我还没死
Lucky I'm still alive.

260
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,520
你要把他怎么样?
What are you gonna do with him?

261
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:50,534
我要他告诉我 他们把我的孩子弄到哪儿去了...
He's gonna tell me where they've got my baby...

262
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:55,237
在哪... 我儿子Aron在哪
Where... Where they've got Aron.

263
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:56,488
我们没抓你儿子
We don't have your kid.

264
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:58,219
你说谎 嗯? 我知道你们抓了他
You're lying, okay? I know you have him.

265
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,261
这太荒谬了 我们从来没有抓走你的...
That's crazy. We never took your...

266
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,243
- 闭嘴  - Claire 你怎么知道是他们干的?
- Shut up.  - Claire, how do you know they took him?

267
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,767
- 你怎么能如此确定?  - 我怎么能确定?
- How can you be so sure?  - How can I be so sure?

268
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:07,697
好 嗯 首先 是我父亲告诉我的
Okay, well, first my father told me,

269
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,615
然后是我的朋友 所以 我非常确定
and then my friend told me, so I'm pretty damn sure.

270
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,786
你的朋友? 你的朋友是谁?
Your friend? Who is your friend?

271
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:16,080
就是我的朋友
My friend.

272
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,718
你依然是我的朋友 对吧 Jin?
You're still my friend, aren't you, Jin?

273
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:24,555
对
Yes.

274
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,297
是 当然是
Yes, of course.

275
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:30,467
很好
Good.

276
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:32,125
我很高兴
I'm glad.

277

00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:44,311
那么...
So...

280

现在 轮到你了
Now it's your turn.

281
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,141
对不起 老兄
Sorry, dude.

282
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:04,278
为什么?
For what?

283
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:07,052
嗯 为了以前这里发生的事
You know, what happened back there,

284
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,398
你和Kate的分手
wrecking your game with kate.

285
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:12,130
没关系
Don't worry about it.

286
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:13,469
现在已经没有什么 可失去的了
There's nothing left to wreck.

287
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:15,192
是吗? 你们之间到底发生了什么?
Yeah? Whatever happened to you guys?

288
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:16,176
我本以为你们会
I thought you guys were gonna get married

289
00:21:16,264 --> 00:21:17,761
结婚生子
and have, like, a dozen kids.

290
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,680
我想我不是那块料
Guess I wasn't cut out for it.

291
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,282
是吗? 我觉得你会是个好父亲
Really? I think you'd make a great dad.

292
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:25,732
我会是一个非常糟糕的父亲
I'd make a terrible dad.

293
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:31,978
那是什么?
What is that?

294
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:34,272
哮喘吸入器
Asthma inhaler.

295
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:36,701
老兄 那是Shannon的
Dude, it's Shannon's.

296
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:41,247
我们在洞穴这儿
We're at the caves.

297
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,386
我们住过的那个洞穴?
The caves we used to live in?

298
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:52,915
我差点忘了这儿有这些东西 伙计
I totally forgot these were in here, man.

299
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,062
等等
Wait a sec.

300
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,337
假如我们又经历了一次时空穿梭
What if we time traveled again

301
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:08,486
嗯 去到了 恐龙时代
to, like, dinosaur times,

302
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:11,885
然后我们死了 接着被埋葬在了这儿 那会怎样?
and then we died and then we got buried here?

303
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:16,244
假如这些骷髅 就是我们自己呢?
What if these skeletons are us?

304
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:25,482
那是什么?
What's that?

305
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,967
我告诉过你 我是怎么找到这个地方的吗?
I ever tell you how I found this place?

306
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,022
你那时正在找水源 对吧?
You were looking for water, right?

307
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,377
不
No.

308
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:39,590
我在追赶我父亲的幽灵
I was chasing the ghost of my dead father.

309
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,982
是他把我带到了这儿
He led me here.

310
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,487
那是他的棺材...
That was his coffin...

311
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,094
后来我把它砸了
Before I smashed it to pieces.

312
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,994
你为什么要那么做?
Why'd you do that?

313
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:03,562
因为里面是空的
Because he wasn't in it.

314
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,520
David啊?
David?

哥们儿 这太炫了

342
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,479
像桥段一样
Very old school.

343
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:16,293
什么?
What?

344
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,067
就是 你和我...
You know, you and me...

345

穿越丛林...
Trekking through the jungle...

346
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,834
去做一些我们不清楚的事情
On our way to do something that we don't quite understand.

347
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:28,336

Good times.

348
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,340
你介意我问你些事情吗?
You mind if I ask you somethin'?

349
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,738
问吧
Sure.

350
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,607
你为什么回来?
Why'd you come back?

351
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,132
你知道的... 就是回到岛上而已
You know... To the island.

352
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:44,000
你为什么回来?
Why'd you come back?

353
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:47,733
在洛杉矶的时候
Back in L.A.,

354
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:49,999
Jacob跳上我出租车的后座
Jacob hopped into the back of my cab,

355
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,783
告诉我 我应该回来 所以我就来了
and told me I was supposed to, so I came.

356
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:58,007
怎么?
What?

357
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:03,502
哥们儿 你要是有更好的理由回来 就说出来
If you have a better reason for coming back, let's hear it, man.

358
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,865
我回来 是因为我太伤心了
I came back here because I was broken.

359
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:20,738
我居然傻到 相信这个地方能慰藉我
And I was stupid enough to think this place would fix me.

360
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,472
哥们儿 抱歉
Dude, I'm sorry.

361
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:30,630
Hurley 我们还要走多远?
How much further we got, Hurley?

362
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:34,769
不远了 就快到了
It's not far. It's not far at all.

363
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,969
就在那儿
It's right there.

364
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:55,816
是个灯塔
It's a lighthouse.

365
00:27:57,098 --> 00:27:57,911
我不明白
I don't understand.

366
00:27:58,068 --> 00:27:59,549
我们之前怎么没见过?
How is it that we've never seen it before?

367
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,459
我猜 是我们没去找吧
I guess we weren't looking for it.

368
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,500
告诉我 我儿子在哪儿
So tell me where my son is.

369
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:15,273
我不知道你儿子在哪儿
I don't know where your son is.

370
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,639
别替他们说话了
Stop covering for them.

371
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:17,994
他们不会帮你了
They're not gonna help you anymore.

372
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:20,549
你要做的 就是告诉我真相
All you've gotta do is just tell me the truth.

373
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:23,552
我说的就是真相 听着 我们没抓你儿子
I am telling you the truth. Look, we don't have your kid.

374
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,857
- 我们从来没抓过你儿子!  - 别说谎了!
- We never had your kid!  - Stop lying to me!

375
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:29,538
你们拉我去寺庙 还折磨我
Your people took me to the temple and tortured me.

376
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:31,790
不是 我们抓你 是因为你在丛林里
No, we captured you because you were out here in the jungle

377
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:32,854
杀我们的人
picking our people off.

378
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:34,136
Claire 等等!
Claire, wait!

379
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,818
等等
Hold on.

380
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:35,892
"等"?
"Hold on"?

381
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:40,063
Jin 他们拿针扎我! 他们拿烙铁烫我!
Jin, they stuck me with needles! They branded me!

382
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,257
要不是我从寺庙里逃出来
And if I hadn't been able to escape from the temple,

383
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:47,664
他们就把我杀了
they would've killed me.

384
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:48,665
不 你记错了
No, you're not remembering things right.

385
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,635
噢 闭嘴 行吗?!
Oh, shut up, okay?!

386
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,534
再给你一次机会 再多给你一次机会
You've got one more chance. One more chance.

387
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,120
告诉我 我儿子在哪儿
Just tell me where my son is.

388
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,268
我不知道你那该死的孩子在哪儿!
I don't know where your damn kid is!

389
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:57,945
Kate带走了他!
Kate took him!

390
00:28:59,593 --> 00:29:00,938
Kate带走了Aaron
Kate took Aaron.

391
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,159
她带着他离开了小岛
She took him with her when she left the island.

392
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:06,579
什么叫她带着他?
What do you mean she took him?

393
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:09,332
他一直跟... Kate在一起...
He's been with h... with Kate...

394
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,240
从三年前起就是这样
for the past three years.

395
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,212
Aaron三岁了
Aaron is 3.

396
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:18,372
他说的是真的
He's telling you the truth.

397
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:20,906
我们什么也没干
We had nothing to do with this.

398
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:24,639
所以你要是放了我
So if you just untie me,

399
00:29:25,452 --> 00:29:26,339
我马上就走
I'll leave,

400
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,956
我发誓 我永远都不会告诉其他人
and I promise I will never tell anyone

401
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:30,624
我见过你
I ever even saw you.

402
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:37,173
放了我吧
Just untie me.

403
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,536
帅吧?
Pretty cool, huh?

404
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,101
Jacob在这儿?
Jacob's in here?

405
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:21,426
应该吧
I guess so.

406
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,345
但是我们要先上楼 把它打开
But first we gotta go upstairs and turn this thing on.

407
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:31,769
你胳膊上没说
It doesn't say anything on your arm

408
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:35,356
- 门会被锁上?  - 没
- about the door being jammed?  - No.

409
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,134
你先走
After you.

410
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,820
是你儿子吗?
Is that your son?

411
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:06,104
是的
Yes.

412
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,846
他真的很棒
He's really good.

413
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,451
他们这么小 不该承受这种压力
They are too young to have this kind of pressure,

414
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:30,661
对吗?
aren't they?

415
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:35,416
嗯 是的 他们确实太小了
Yes. Yes, they are.

416
00:32:36,344 --> 00:32:38,804
站这儿看着 却没法帮忙 真难受
It's hard to watch and be unable to help.

417
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:41,901
你的儿子很有天赋
Your son has a gift.

418
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:45,863
他弹了多长时间?
How long has he been playing?

419
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:48,220
我...
I...

420
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,274
我不知道
I don't know.

421
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:12,828
哇
Whoa.

422
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,701
哥们儿 这太酷了
Dude, this is cool.

423
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:19,194
建这个 肯定是想帮船开过来之类的
Must've built this to help ships get here and stuff.

424
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,052
我猜他们用镜子 是因为...
I guess they used a mirror 'cause...

425
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,784
还没发明电呢
electricity hadn't been invented yet.

426
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,444
- Jacob在哪儿?  - 哦 他还没来呢
- Where's Jacob?  - Uh, he's not here yet.

427
00:33:31,832 --> 00:33:32,822
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

428
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,995
到了108度的时候告诉我
Tell me when it gets to 108 degrees.

429
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,292
停
Stop.

430
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:19,784
你看到了吗?
Did you see that?

431
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:21,286
我看见什么了?
Did I see what?

432
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:23,319
镜子 我看见镜子里有东西
The mirror. I saw something in the mirror.

433
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,844
哥们儿 大海而已
It's just ocean, dude.

434
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:38,532
这上面刻了一堆名字
There are names.

435
00:34:44,872 --> 00:34:46,175
转到23度
Turn it to 23 degrees.

436
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,877
噢 我... 我觉得Jacob不想...
Oh, I... I don't think Jacob wants...

437
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,106
啊? 这是什么?
What? What is that?

438
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:13,745
我的房子
It's my house.

439
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:17,343
我在那房子里长大的
It's the house I grew up in.

440
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:19,324
呃
Huh.

441
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:22,108
太诡异了
That's weird.

442
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,330
我在那儿从小住到大
I have lived in that house since I was a kid.

443
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:30,116
他一直在观察我们
He's been watching us.

444
00:35:32,462 --> 00:35:34,777
每时每刻 我们所有人 他一直在观察我们
The whole time, all of us. He's been watching us.

445
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:38,760
Hurley啊
Hurley.

446
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:40,689
Jacob在哪儿?
Where's Jacob?

447
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:43,252
我不知道
I don't know.

448
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,277
你说过他会来这儿的
You said that he would be here.

449
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:47,958
我也只是... 猜猜而已
Well, I was just... kind of assuming.

450
00:35:48,552 --> 00:35:49,449
Hurley啊...
Hurley...

451
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,289
我想知道 他干嘛要观察我
I wanna know why was he watching me.

452
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:56,105
我想知道 你赶快叫他出来啊
I wanna know, so you're gonna ask him right now.

453
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:57,742
这样没用 我跟你说过的
It doesn't work like that. I told you.

454
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:00,380
只有他想出现的时候 他才会出现
He just kinda shows up whenever he feels like it.

455
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:07,648
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

456
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:13,675
- 他干嘛要观察我?  - 我不知道
- Why was he watching me?  - I don't know.

457
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:16,344
- 为什么我的名字 会写在这上面?  - 他没告诉我
- Why is my name written down on this thing?  - He didn't tell me.

458
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,023
他想从我这儿得到什么? 他想从我这儿得到什么?!
What does he want from me? What does he want from me?!

459
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,952
- 我本来要去...  - 我不知道 Jack!
- I was supposed to do...  - I don't know, Jack!

460
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:21,881
不要啊!
Don't!

461
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,743
表现得不错啊
You were great in there.

462
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:03,093
你看到我了?
You saw me?

463
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:10,183
我漏弹了几个音符
I missed a couple of notes.

464
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,759
我站那儿听的时候 觉得很棒
It sounded perfect from where I was standing.

465
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,296
David 你吓到我了
David, you scared the hell out of me.

466
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:22,873
那会儿你在奶奶家
You were at grandma's.

467
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,596
我以为 我能在你回家之前 赶回来的
I thought I could get back to your place before you got home.

468
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:30,589
我甚至不知道 你还在弹钢琴
I didn't even know you were still playing.

469
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:34,290
我答应过妈妈不告诉你的
I made mom promise not to tell you.

470
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:36,522
为什么?
Why?

471
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:40,401
你一直很看重这件事
It was always such a big deal to you.

472
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,341
你一直坐着看我练习
You used to sit and watch me practice.

473
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:44,978
你是那么...
You were so...

474
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:47,898
沉醉
into it.

475
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:54,782
我没有告诉你我来这儿 是因为...
I didn't tell you I was coming here because...

476
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:58,015
我不想让你看到 我失败的样子
I didn't want you to see me fail.

477
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:11,090
当我和你一样大的时候
You know, when I was your age,

478
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:14,041
我父亲也不想看到我失败
my father didn't want to see me fail either.

479
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:17,263
他常对我说...
He used to say to me that...

480
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:21,611
他说我没有天赋
He said that I didn't have what it takes.

481
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:26,856
这句话一直在我脑海中徜徉
I spent my whole life carrying that around with me.

482
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:32,591
我不想让你重蹈覆辙
And I don't ever want you to feel that way.

483
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:35,963
我一直深爱着你
I will always love you,

484
00:38:37,444 --> 00:38:38,414
无论你做得怎么样
No matter what you do.

485
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:41,886
在... 在我看来 你一定不会失败的
In... in my eyes, you can never fail.

486
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:46,683
我只是想 成为你生命中的一部分
I just wanna be a part of your life.

487
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:55,087
好吧
Okay.

488
00:39:01,593 --> 00:39:03,866
我买了点披萨在家里 你饿了吗?
I've got some pizza back at the house. You hungry?

489
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:06,285
当然
Sure.

490
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:08,173
好的
Good.

491
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:11,541
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

492
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,495
怎么样了?
How'd it go?

493
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:40,915
伙计 你刚刚在哪儿啊?
Where were you, man?

494
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,095
无所谓啦 他反正又看不到我
Doesn't matter. He wouldn't have been able to see me anyway.

495
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:45,607
没错 如果你告诉了我
Yeah, well, I'd you had told me that

496
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,630
比如说 你解释了这一切的话
and had, like, explained everything,

497
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:48,954
或许Jack不会生气的
then maybe Jack wouldn't have freaked out

498
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:51,071
也不会把你的镜子砸得粉碎
and smashed your mirror into a billion pieces.

499
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,469
多亏了这七年多的霉运啊
Thanks for the seven years of bad luck, by the way.

500
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:55,384
你额头上有墨水
You got ink on your forehead.

501
00:39:57,282 --> 00:39:59,523
我额头上有墨水? 你就只会说这个啊?!
I have ink on my forehead? That's all you have to say?!

502
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,943
Jack毁了你的灯塔 哥们!
Jack broke your lighthouse, dude!

503
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,319
任务失败了
Mission unaccomplished.

504
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:05,748
那些你说我们要去帮助的 来这个岛的人
Whoever you said we needed to help get to the island

505
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,585
- 全都没戏了  - 哦 我想他们会有办法的
- is totally screwed.  - Oh, I'm sure they'll find some other way.

506
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:12,338
那么...
So...

507
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:15,571
你让我做的每一件事 都被搞砸了
Everything you wanted me to do didn't get done,

508
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:18,584
你... 一点儿也不介意?
and... you don't even care?

509
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,345
等一下
Wait a minute.

510
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,515
你就是想让Jack 看到镜子里的东西吧?
Did you want Jack to see what was in that mirror?

511
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:33,937
为什么?
Why?

512
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:38,045
只有这样 才能让他意识到 他自己有多么重要
It was the only way for him to understand how important he is.

513
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:41,757
如果这是你的计划 那就事与愿违了
Well, if that was your plan, I think it backfired, man.

514
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:43,957
Jack来这儿 是因为他有事要做
Jack is here because he has to do something.

515
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:47,304
别人不能告诉他是什么 他得自己发现
He can't be told what that is. He's gotta find it himself.

516
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,395
有时候 你可以搭上一辆出租车
Sometimes you can just hop in the back of someone's cab

517
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:54,009
然后告诉他们去哪儿
and tell 'em what they're supposed to do.

518
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,408
但有时
Other times,

519
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,640
你得让他们自己 面朝大海想想
You have to let him look out at the ocean for a while.

520
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,511
下次 你还是先把一切告诉我 好不?
Well, next time, how about you tell me everything up front?

521
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:08,680
我不喜欢玩神秘这一套 懂吗?
I'm not big on secret plans, okay?

522
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:10,568
我可禁不起你不来的后果 Hugo啊
I couldn't risk you not coming, Hugo.

523
00:41:11,694 --> 00:41:12,559
我得确保把你和Jack一起
I had to get you and Jack

524
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:16,584
- 从神庙那儿叫过来  - 什么? 为什么?
- as far away from that temple as I possibly could.  - What? Why?

525
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:18,346
因为有人马上就要去那儿了
'Cause someone's coming there.

526
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,401
很坏的人
Someone bad.

527
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,883
兄弟 我们得去警告下他们
Dude, we have to warn them.

528
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:24,144
你不能警告他们 Hugo
You can't warn them, Hugo.

529
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:26,855
对不起 太迟了
I'm sorry. It's too late.

530
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:43,288
听着 如果我不杀他 他会杀了我
Look, if I didn't kill him, he would've killed me.

531
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:47,459
真高兴你没替他松绑
I'm glad you didn't untie him.

532
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:51,315
Claire 不管你是怎么想的...
Claire, please, whatever you're thinking...

533
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:53,236
为什么你会说Kate在抚养Aaron?
Why'd you say that Kate was raising Aaron?

534
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,011
我骗你的
I was lying.

535
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:03,348
为什么?
Why?

536
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:07,279
因为我想保住他的命
Because I wanted to save his life.

537
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:11,982
但你是对的
But you were right.

538
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:14,745
The Others带走了你的孩子
The Others have your baby.

539
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:18,217
Aaron在寺庙里
Aaron is at the temple.

540
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:20,261
我看到他在那儿了
I know because I saw him there.

541
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:23,524
但你需要我的帮助 才能找到他
But you'll need me to get to him.

542
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:32,794
我们怎么进去?
How do we get in?

543
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,066
有条秘道 没人会发现我们
There's a secret way. No one will see us.

544
00:42:39,954 --> 00:42:42,258
谢谢 Jin 谢谢
Thank you, Jin. Thank you.

545
00:42:45,386 --> 00:42:47,034
真高兴你是在说谎
And I'm so glad to know you were lying.

546
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:49,880
如果你说的是真的话
Because if what you said was the truth,

547
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,330
如果Kate在抚养Aaron的话?
if Kate was raising Aaron?

548
00:42:54,043 --> 00:42:55,219
我会杀了她
I'd kill her.

549
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:00,045
打扰你们了吗?
Am I interrupting?

550
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,618
是John?
John?

551
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:14,707
不是John啦 这是我的朋友

That's not John. This is my friend.
