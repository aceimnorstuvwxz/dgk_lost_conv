剧情回顾......
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:05,044
你想让我救你的命?
You want me to save your life?

3
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:07,073
我想让你自己想救我的命
I want you to want to save my life.

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:10,028
我刚在 Ben 的肾脏旁边切了个小口
Just made a small incision in Ben's kidney sac.

5
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:13,066
如果我一小时内不把他缝上 他就会死
Now if I don't stitch that back up in the next hour, he's dead.

6
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:15,070
我希望你能进去
I would like for you to go back in there,

7
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,058
完成他的手术
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

8
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,099
我为什么要这样做?
And why would I want to do that?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,022
因为我能帮你的朋友逃跑
Because I'm going to go help your friends escape.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,010
- 不!  - Danny!
- N0!  - Danny!

11
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:38,089
Show me the way to go home

12
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:43,090
I'm tired,and I wanna go to bed

13
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:48,056
had a little drink about an hour ago

14
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:51,006
and it went straight to my head

15
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,014
别唱了!
Stop!

16
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:54,015
怎么 你想驾驶吗?
What, you wanna turn steering?

17
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,061
我们必须回去
We have to go back.

18
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:57,011
你到底在说什么?
What the hell are you talking about?

19
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,076
我们要回去 Sawyer
Turn the boat around, Sawyer,I mean it.

20
00:00:58,077 --> 00:01:00,057
你疯了吗? 我们刚逃走
Have you lost your mind? We just got away.

21
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:01,061
照我说的做
Just do it.

22
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:06,092
- 请你给我一个理由  - 我们不能把 Jack 留在那里
- You give me one good reason to turn...  - Because we can't leave Jack behind.

23
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:13,017
是的 我们能 小妞...
Yes, we can, Freckles...

24
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,088
因为是他让我们这样做的
'cause that's what he asked us to do.

25
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:17,088
你想想  如果我们回去
I mean, think about it? We go back there,

26
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:21,067
被那个白痴猎人Ben抓到 他会怎么对待我们?
what do you think captain bunnykiller's gonna do if he catches us?

27
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:23,073
他会杀了你们的
He'll kill you.

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,061
上帝爱你像爱 Jacob 一样
God loves you as he loved Jacob.

29
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:35,095
谢谢你的建议
Thanks for the input.

30
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:39,016
抱歉 小妞...
Sorry, kiddo...

31
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,029
Jack 只能靠自己了
Jack's on his own.

32
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,096
是时候了
Time to get up.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,075
我们要把你转走
We're moving you.

34
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:55,084
- 去哪里?   - 另外一个地方 Jack
- Moving me where?   - Someplace else, Jack.

35
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:57,084
为什么?
Why?

36
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:06,005
- 就这样了 是吗?  - "这样"?
- So this is it, huh?  -"It"?

37
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,039
你刚帮我救了他的命
You just helped me save his life.

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,043
你要杀我的话就说的直接点
If you're gonna kill me,pls,at least show me the respect of not calling it "moving."

39
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:16,060
我们为什么要杀你?
Now why would we kill you?

40
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:18,065
因为我已经没有利用价值了
Because you're done with me.

41
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,073
你以为我们是什么人?
What kind of people do you think we are?

42
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,061
我不知道 Tom
I don't know, Tom.

43
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:24,045

劫持孕妇...
take a pregnant woman...

45
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,053
把 Charlie 吊在树上...
would hang Charlie from a tree...

46
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:31,004
把我们的人拖进丛林...
would drag our people out of the jungle...

47
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,079
还绑架儿童
would kidnap children?

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,055
我就是这么想的
That's the kind of people I think you are.

49
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:51,006
你看见你住的玻璃房了 Jack?
You see this glass house you're living in, Jack?

50
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:55,057
要不要去更舒服的地方?
How 'bout I get you some stones?

51
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:04,004
这很简单 你怎么说?
Let's do this the easy way. What do you say?

52
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:22,035
Jack 医生? Jack 医生?

想要汽水吗 Jack医生?
Dr. Jack want soda?

54
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:43,004
你知道我不懂你说的话
You know I can't understand a word you're saying, right?

55
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:44,088
Jack 医生
Dr. Jack

56
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,043

74
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,067
Juliet 为我做的?
Juliet grilled these for me.

75
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:46,016
那个女人是谁?
Who's that woman?

76
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:49,000
她是司法长官
That'd be the sheriff.

77
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:51,000
- 你们有司法长官?   - 不完全是 Jack
- You have a sheriff?  - Not literally.

78
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,021
你们为什么要把 Juliet 转到我的房间?
Why are you moving Juliet into my room?

79
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:57,006
因为她有麻烦了 Jack
'Cause she's in trouble.

80
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:04,018
你别干傻事 老实待着
Now don't try anything stupid. You stay put in this cage, okay?

81
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,073
你们不是有监视器吗?
You say that like you're not watching me from that camera right there.

82
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:13,062
对了 Ben告诉我 你进过监控室
Oh, right. Ben told me you got into the surveillance room.

83
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:26,083
问你个问题
Let me ask you something.

84
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:29,041
你冒着生命危险
You risk your neck to cut them loose,

85
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,067
帮他们逃走...
and they run away and don't ever look back...

86
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:34,051
谢谢你给我的三明治
Thanks for the sandwich.

87
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,093
真没想到我又回来了
Never thought I'd be glad to get back to this rock again.

88
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:47,031
你在干吗?
What are you doing?

89
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:49,027
你说在干吗  我们要上岸啊!
What's it look like? I'm heading into shore.

90
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,053
如果我们沿着海岸继续划 可以划到我们的营地
If we just keep going, we can circle round.

91
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,040
我们可以告诉 Locke 和 Sayid 发生了什么
Sooner or later we'll get to camp and tell Locke and Sayid what happened.

92
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,019
我们会的是吗?
Oh, we will?

93
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,004
你有地图吗 麦哲伦小妞?
You got a map you ain't showing me, Magellan?

94
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,020
我们没有水没有食物
We got no food, no water,

95
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:03,020
在夜里我不能划这艘船
and I can't steer in the dark.

96
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,083
- 那么让我来  - 不行
- Then I'll steer.  - No.

97
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:09,021
我们上岸然后扎营
You'll come ashore, and we'll make camp.

98
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:15,068
你想贡献的话就把篝火点起来
You want to contribute?You can build a campfire while I carry the kid.

99
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:18,056
很高兴我们达成共识
Glad we agree.

100
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:35,049
- 你不饿吗?  - 不 James 我不饿
- Sure you ain't hungry?  - No, James, I ain't hungry.

101
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,074
你们不该吵架
You shouldn't fight.

102
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:41,032
你什么时候醒的?
When the hell did you wake up?

103
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:45,053
你们不该吵架 因为你们幸运的活了下来
You shouldn't fight because you're lucky to be alive.

104
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:49,075
我想他说到点子上了
Golly! I think he's got a point!

105
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:54,050
你们住在那座岛上吗?
That island we were on... Is that where your people live?

106
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:58,080
- 只是用来工作  - 什么工作?
- Just where we work.  - Work on what?

107
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,017
一些工程
Projects.

108
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:03,072
就像 "把孩子从木伐上偷走" 的工程?
Oh, sure, like the "steal the kid off the raft" project?

109
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:05,018
干的真是出色
That was a humdinger.

110
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,010
你们不是住在那座岛上的?
So you don't actually live on that island?

111
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,039
你住在这里...
Do you live here...

112
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,039
这座岛上吗?
on this island?

113
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,082
是的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:20,078
那你们为什么要抓那些人...
And what did you do with the people that you took...

115
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,099
和孩子们?
the kids?

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,061
我们要给他们更好的生活
We give them a better life.

117
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,087
相对什么?
Better than what?

118
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:28,029
相对你们的生活
Better than yours.

119
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,021
今晚不会有月亮了
There's not gonna be any moon tonight.

120
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:40,009
将是一片黑暗
It'll be dark.

121
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,034
晚上我和 Alex 通常躺在 我家的后院
Me and Alex used to lie in my backyard at night,

122
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:45,055
给星座取名字
make up names for the constellations.

123
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:47,014
你还看不见 但...
You can't see it yet,

124
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:51,022
那个是"ursa theodorus"...
but right there will be "Ursa Theodorus"...

125
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,010
泰迪熊
the teddy bear.

126
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:56,070
- 你还有后院?  - 是的
- You have backyards?  -Yeah.

127
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:00,099
那听起来真诱人
Well, ain't that quaint?

128
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,017
警报
Warning!

129
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:13,092

130

我以为你被关起来了
I thought you were locked up.

131
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:35,081
他们让我检查 Ben
They let me out to examine Ben.

132
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:38,040
他的器官活动很底 还有高烧
His vitals are low, and he has a fever.

133
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,065
这是我10分钟前拍的
I took this about ten minutes ago.

134
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:43,012
是他的缝针
It's of his stitches.

135
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:47,049
他们被感染了?
They're infected, aren't they?

136
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,036
是的
Yes.

137
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:50,087
你能来看看他吗?
Will you come look at them?

138
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,087
不行
No.

139
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:53,009
- Jack - 不行
- Jack.  -No.

140
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,075
你不必为他们... 或他这么做
I'm not asking you for them... or him.

141
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:59,093
就算是为了我
I'm asking you as a personal favor to me.

142
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:04,092
你想让我再帮他一次?
You... want me to help him again?

143
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,051
是的
Yes.

144
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:08,093
你确定吗 Juliet?
Are you sure about that, Juliet?

145
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:11,055
是的 我很确定
Yes... I'm sure.

146
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:15,027
这是因为他能让你回家吗?
And this is because he said that he would let you go home?

147
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:16,099
不是的
No.

148
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,028
不 我...
No, I...

149
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:25,044
因为我遇到麻烦了
It's because I'm in trouble.

150
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:27,095
- 麻烦? 为了...  - 我杀了个人
- Trouble? For...  - I just killed someone.

151
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:30,032
所以他们把我关起来了
That's why they put me in your room.

152
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,038
你杀了谁?
Who?

153
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:36,096
这很复杂
It's complicated.

154
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:41,083
让我直接和你说吧
Well, then, let me simplify it for you.

155
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:44,051
我不会帮他的...
I'm not gonna help him...

156
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:49,006
我也不会帮你
and I'm not gonna help you.

157
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:15,079
今日特别泰国菜 你尝尝
Special Thai dish for you. You try.

158
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:30,072
非常勇敢!
Very brave, very brave.

159
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:34,047
我哥哥喜欢你
My brother likes you.

160
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:37,081
我是一个受欢迎的人
Well, I'm a very likeable guy.

161
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:42,065
Jack...

162
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,094
问你个问题
tell me something.

163
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:46,052
说吧
Shoot.

164
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:50,066
为什么你不懂怎么放风筝?
Why is it you don't know how to fly a kite?

165
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:54,074
- 我从没学过  - 那真可惜
- Just never learned, I guess.  - That's very sad.

166
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:57,066
我爸工作很忙
Well, my dad worked a lot.

167
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:01,016
而且他也不是那种会喜欢放风筝的人
He wasn't exactly the kite-flying type, anyway.

168
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:02,083
- 我的意思是 我们  - Jack
- I mean, we never really...  -Jack

169
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:07,014
- 怎么了?  - 我对你父亲不感兴趣
- Yeah?  - I have no interest in your father.

170
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:10,084
好吧 我也厌倦了总是说起他
Well, that's a relief,because I'm pretty tired of talking about him.

171
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,085
有些事可以放在心里
Some things are personal.

172
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:25,024
你来 Phuket 是 "找回自我"?
So you're in Phuket to... "find yourself"?

173
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,078
- 为什么这么说?  - 你是个美国人
- Why would you say that?  - You're an American.

174
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,038
我有...
I have...

175
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,030
一个天赋
a gift.

176
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,098
那一定很值得期待
Must be one hell of a gift.

177
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:25,041
我在读你纹身上的字
I was just reading your tattoos.

178
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:28,017
"五" 和周围的星星都很漂亮
The "five" and the stars are very cute,

179
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:31,089
但那上面的中文字...
But the Chinese I find...

180
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,021
有点讽刺
a bit ironic.

181
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:39,019
- 什么讽刺?  - 它所表达的
- You find what ironic?  - What it says.

182
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:43,052
你知道它表示什么?
You do know what it says?

183
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,060
是的 我知道
Yeah, I know what it says.

184
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:49,027
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

185
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:51,098
中文是一种很复杂的语言
Chinese is a very complicated language.

186
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:55,048
我们往往会不能完全理解它的意思
It's fairly common for some things to get lost in translation.

187
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:01,000
- 我知道它表示什么  - 那好吧
- I know what it says.  - All right, then.

188
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,054
Jack...

189
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,017
我的名字叫 Isabel
My name is Isabel.

190
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,050
如果你跟我来
If you'll come with me,

191
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:17,035
我要问你几个问题
I'd like to talk to you and ask you a few questions.

192
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:33,091
你为什么不去看看你父亲 他会很高兴的
Why don't you check on your father, sweetheart? I know he'd appreciate it.

193
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:48,083
请坐 Jack
Please, have a seat, Jack.

194
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:50,091
我们今天聚在一起
As you may have gathered,

195
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,079
我们不住在这座小岛上
we don't live on this little island.

196
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,050
我们也不喜欢来这里
In fact, most of us don't really even like coming here.

197
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:59,013
我在调查一起暴力事件
There's been an incident that I'm investigating,

198
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:01,018
我要问你几个问题
and I need to ask you some questions,

199
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,001
希望你能解决这里的...
so I was hoping you may help me clear up

200
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:08,056
不安定因素
a few of the... inconsistencies.

201
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:10,089
如果我说错的话告诉我 Tom
Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom,

202
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,081
你说在手术过程中
but you said, in the midst of a surgical procedure,

203
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:20,083
Jack 说 Juliet 让他杀死 Ben
Jack made several comments indicating that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.

204
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:23,061
对
Yeah. That's right.

205
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,087
这是真的吗 Jack?
Is that true, Jack?

206
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:30,005
Juliet 有没有叫你杀了 Ben?
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

207
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,030
问题很简单 Juliet 有没有叫你杀了 Ben?
The question's simple. Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

208
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,088
没有
No

209
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,022
没有 我撒了谎
No, I was lying.

210
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:48,064
我会尽全力救我的伙伴
I would've done anything to get my friends out,

211
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,077
所以我制造混乱
and turning you people against each other

212
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,015
让你们互相猜疑
was my best chance of creating chaos.

213
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:10,013
你为什么替她撒谎 Jack?
Why are you lying for her, Jack?

214
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:24,014
我想回我的牢房
I'd like to go back to my cage now.

215
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:35,069
谁在那儿?
Who's there?

216
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:39,070
你认为呢?
Who do you think?

217
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:51,078
几点了?
What time is it?

218
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,042
很晚了
It's late.

219
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:02,067
好咸啊
Salty.

220
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:05,009
我去大海游泳了
I went for a swim in the ocean.

221
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,018
洗刷一天的疲劳?
Washing the day off of you, huh?

222
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,097
你想问我什么 Jack?
Is there something you'd like to ask me, Jack?

223
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:15,019
什么都没有
No, not at all.

224
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:18,098
这样也好...
I mean...it might be nice...

225
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:22,065
已经一个月了
after a month of you coming and going whenever you want,

226
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:25,079
我还对你一无所知
to find out something about you.

227
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:35,067
这里发生的事你永远不会了解
There are things that happen here that you could never understand.

228
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,089
就像你的天赋?
Like your gift?

229
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:48,014
是的...
Yes...

230
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:51,010
就像我的天赋
like my gift.

231
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,046
你和我在一起快乐吗 Jack?
Are you having fun with me, Jack?

232
00:19:17,046 --> 00:19:19,076
是的

Do I...do I know you?

237
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,080

242
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:30,070
他们在这里干嘛? 你在这里干什么?!

286
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:21,038
Ben

287
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,072
你为什么要救他?
Why'd you save his life?

288
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:26,018
经历了这一切...
All this time...

289
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,035
他对你的人的所作所为...
After all he did to you and your people...

290
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:30,027
你应该恨他才对
you should hate him,

291
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,077
但你还是救了他的命
But you still fixed him up,

292
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:36,019
甚至在你朋友逃跑后 为什么?
even after your friends got away. Why?

293
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,078
你是他女儿
You're his daughter.

294
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,049
回答我的问题
Answer the question.

295
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,029
那你也要给我些答案
I'll answer your question if you answer one of mine.

296
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:47,070
Juliet 在哪里?
Where's Juliet?

297
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:51,091
他和他们在一起 他们正在读她的判决书
She's with the rest of them. They're gonna read her verdict.

298
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:53,037
她的判决书?
Her verdict?

299
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,087
我们都知道会发生什么
And we all know what it's gonna be.

300
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:59,085
自相惨杀从不被允许
We're pretty strict about killing one of our own.

301
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:03,017
一命抵一命
Eye for an eye.

302
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:04,084
她杀了谁?
Who? Who did she kill?

303
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:08,056
那个想要杀死你朋友的人
The man who was gonna murder your friends.

304
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:17,069
没想到你还挺关心她的
No wonder you're so worried about her.

305
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,007
如果不是为了你 她不会这么做的
If it wasn't for you, she never would have done it.

306
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:24,007
那是第三个问题了
That was three questions.

307
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:27,041
到你了 Jack
Your turn, Jack.

308
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:31,059
我救你父亲 因为我答应过他
I saved your father because I said I would.

309
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,026
他还掌管吗?
Is he still in charge?

310
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:44,017
什么?
What?

311
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:46,030
Ben 你父亲-- 他还在掌管吗?
Ben, your father...Is he still in charge?

312
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:48,068
Isabel 会听他的吗?
Will that woman Isabel do what he says?

313
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:49,093
是的
Yeah.

314
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:52,065
把我放出来
Get me out of this cage.

315
00:25:56,086 --> 00:26:01,011
我不会这么做的
I wouldn't do that.

316
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:07,075
骑兵终于来了
The cavalry has arrived at last.

317
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:22,068
如果你们有个出色外科医生就好了
I'd be much more impressed with you people if you had a good surgeon.

318
00:26:25,014 --> 00:26:29,022
我们曾经有的 Jack
We had an excellent surgeon, Jack.

319
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:32,085
他叫 Ethan
His name was Ethan.

320
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:36,010
已经大面积感染了 Ben
You have a very serious infection, Ben.

321
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,064
被感染的组织需要从新切开
That infected tissue needs to be re-incised, debrided,

322
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:44,052
你需要随时监控
and you need to be very closely monitored from here on out.

323
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:49,069
不然也许会造成神经受损 或者会有其它炎症
There might be nerve damage or any number of other complications.

324
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,087
你可能永远不能走路了
You might not walk again.

325
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:57,049
这话告诉我你另有所图
Your bedside manner leaves something to be desired.

326
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,080
谁让你和我困在一起了
Well, then, it's too bad you're stuck with me.

327
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:03,063
是吗?
Am I?

328
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:05,034
你需要一名医生 Ben
You need a doctor, Ben.

329
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:08,009
能和你待在一起
someone to stay with you

330
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,068
让你快点恢复
bring you back to good health.

331
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:17,052
又来了
And here we go again.

332
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:20,093
我已经答应你 让你离开这座岛了 Jack
I've already given you a ticket off this island.

333
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:23,035
这次你又要我做什么?
What's it gonna cost me this time?

334
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:27,007
现在你的人正在讨论
Right now your people are in a room

335
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:30,099
是否要处决 Juliet
deciding whether or not to execute Juliet.

336
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:36,079
你可以阻止他们
You're gonna stop it.

337
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:40,080
Juliet 不在乎你的 Jack
Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack.

338
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:44,029
不管她做了什么
Doesn't matter what she's done,

339
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,014
不论你怎么想...
No matter what you think...

340
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:52,018
她还是我们的人
she's one of us.

341
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:58,040
成交吗?
Do we have a deal or not?

342
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:07,020
Isabel 有对讲机吗?
Does Isabel have a walkie?

343
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:10,083
他们已经在开会了
They're already in the meeting.

344
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,088
那就拿纸过来写吧

345
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:36,091
你跟踪我
You following me.

346
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:44,029
这些都是什么?
What is all this?

347
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:47,041
这是我工作的地方
This is where I work,

348
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:50,034
你不该来这儿
and you shouldn't be here.

349
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:55,018
这是...
This is a...

350
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,027
纹身店 这就是你的秘密?
a tattoo parlor. This was your big secret?

351
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:02,080
信封... 你的天赋?
The envelopes... your gift?

352
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:06,040
我不是纹身艺术家
I am not a tattoo artist.

353
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:15,040
我能看出你是怎样一个人
I'm able to see who people are.

354
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:18,065
我的工作不是装饰...
My work is not decoration...

355
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:22,046
而是注释...
it is definition...

356
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,070
而这...
and this...

357
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:27,021
才是我的天赋
this is my gift.

358
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,055
那么...
So...

359
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:32,008
你能看穿人们
you see who people are.

360
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:36,060
是的... 然后帮他们做记号
Yes... and I mark them.

361
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:41,094
那告诉我我是怎么样一个人
So tell me who I am.

362
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:46,001
- 不行  - 为什么?
- No.  - Why not?

363
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:48,002
你是个外来者
You are an outsider.

364
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:49,073
那你就可以和我上床...
So you can sleep with me...

365
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:52,061
我不可以这么做
I'm not allowed.

366
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:56,065
你知道我是怎样一个人 是吗 Achara?
Do you see who I am, Achara?

367
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:58,091
是的
Yes.

368
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:01,020
那告诉我
Who am I?

369
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:03,070
你是一个领袖
You are a leader,

370
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,004
一个伟大的人
a great man.

371
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:09,005
但这...
But this...

372
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,068
会让你孤独...
this makes you lonely...

373
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:16,072
恐惧...
and frightened..

374
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:19,072
暴怒
and angry.

375
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,086
好
Good.

376
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:33,094
给我作标记吧
Now put it on me.

377
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:36,023
干吧!
Put it on me.

378
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:38,073
不 这...
No. This...

379
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:42,029
是在违背我们的人
this is against my people.

380
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:54,097
这会有报应的 Jack
There will be consequences, Jack.

381
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:58,014
当然会有
There always are.

382
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:24,057
等等 你不该在这里的
Wait. No, you shouldn't be here.

383
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:26,020
退后
Just stand back.

384
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:28,067
不要说话
Don't say anything.

385
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,076
Alex 你...
Alex, you...

386
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:41,072
Jack?

387
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:44,088
你把他带来干什么?!
What the hell did you bring him here for?!

388
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,039
放开他 Tom
Let him go, Tom.

389
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:51,036
怎么了 Alex?
What's going on, Alex?

390
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:54,040
这是 Ben 写的
This is from Ben.

391
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:07,007
Ben 减轻了 Juliet 的罪
Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence.

392
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:09,032
免除死刑
Execution is off the table.

393
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:13,030
他说规章不能改变
He says the rules don't apply.

394
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:18,047
但是 她必须被烙上印记
He has, however, ordered her to be marked.

395
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,009
你去哪儿?
Hey, where you going?

396
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:13,035
我认识你
Hey, I know you.

397
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:16,052
我是 Achara 的朋友 从...
I'm Achara's friend from...

398
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:20,019
我来过你的餐馆
Chet's,from the restaurant.

399
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:26,049
放开我 兄弟
Let go of me, man.

400
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:51,018
滚出我们的海滩!
You will get off our beach!

401
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,089
然后滚出这个国家!
You leave this country!

402
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,077
你明白吗?!
Do you understand me?

403
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:01,021
听说你只喜欢烤的
I heard you only liked them grilled.

404
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:07,047
我也想念这个牙签了
I missed the toothpicks, too.

405
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:17,064
- 让我看看  - Jack...
- Let me see.  - Jack...

406
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:21,032
他们给你做记号 让我看看
They marked you. Let me see it.

407
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
折一片芦荟给我...
Break a branch off that aloe plant over there...

408
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,079
- 没关系的 Jack   - 求你了
- It's ok, Jack.  - Please.

409
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,022
求你了
Please do it.

410
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:05,019
好了 转过身
All right, turn around.

411
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:30,054
为什么帮我?
Why did you help me?

412
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:33,042
他告诉你会让你回家
He told you he was gonna let you go home.

413
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:36,022
他也许诺我同样的事
He told me the same thing.

414
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:39,030
我们要保证他说到做到
We're gonna make sure he keeps his word.

415
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,089
我们怎么做?
And how are we going to do that?

416
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,011
一起面对
Together.

417
00:37:55,091 --> 00:38:01,066
过几分钟他们都会来找你
They'll be coming for you in a few minutes... All of them.

418
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,058
你的朋友知道我们在哪儿
Your friends know where we are,

419
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:07,062
所以我们要回去我们住的地方
so we have to leave this island to go back to where we live.

420
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:10,026
去哪儿?
Go where?

421
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:13,068
Ben 叫它"家园"
Well, Ben calls it "home."

422
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,052
- Karl 在哪里?   - 我让他走了
- Where's Karl?  -I let him go.

423
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:25,051
- 什么?   - 我让他走了
- You what?  - I let him go.

424
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,060
他能带我们去他们住的地方
He could have led us back to where they live.

425
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:30,056
你以为我放了他 是因为我很敏感吗?
What, you think I cut him loose 'cause I'm so damn sensitive?

426
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,056
那孩子是靶子
The kid's a target.

427
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:36,007
Ben 不会放弃找到他 直到...
Ben ain't never gonna stop looking for him, so as long...

428
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:40,082
Ben 只想让他远离他女儿
All Ben wants is that kid as far from his daughter as possible.

429
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,054
我们回营地吧
Let's get back to camp.

430
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,008
你来不来啊?
Are you coming or not?

431
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:54,034
我是和你一起走 还是跟在你后面比较好?
Should I walk beside you or ten paces behind you?

432
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,092
难道你就不觉得很自私么?
You're so good at telling me what to do, I can't think for myself anymore.

433
00:38:57,093 --> 00:39:00,047
别因为你自己有罪恶感 就把这些盖到我头上
Don't take it out on me 'cause you feel guilty.

434
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:02,018
- 我没感到罪恶  - 才怪!
- I don't feel guilty.  - The hell you don't!

435
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:04,068
我们必须留下Jack  我没有选择...
We had to leave Jack behind. I didn't have a choice...

436
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:08,015
我不是说这个
I'm not talking about leaving Jack behind.

437
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:16,087
我是说你我的事
I'm talking about you and me.

438
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:26,095
你这么做是因为 你知道我死定了...
I know you did it 'cause you thought I was a dead man...

439
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:31,042
不要因为医生还留在那里  而埋怨自己
so don't beat yourself up 'cause the doc's left behind.

440
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,017
我没有埋怨自己
I'm not beating myself up.

441
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:38,064
当然
'Course you're not.

442
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:48,002
现在我们可以走了吗?
So now that we got that out of the way, let's go.

443
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:18,000
"他与我们共同前进，但却不是我们的一员"
"He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us."

444
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:22,035
这就是你纹身的意义
Your tattoos...That's what they say.

445
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:28,060
这是他们说的
That's what they say.

446
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:31,048
但不是这个意思
It's not what they mean.

447
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:43,080
