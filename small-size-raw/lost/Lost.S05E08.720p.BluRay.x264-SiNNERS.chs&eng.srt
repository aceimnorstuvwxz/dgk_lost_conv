1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,054
《迷失》前情提要...
Previously on "lost"

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,004
说吧
Now talk.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,068
这个岛
Think of the island

4
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:08,048
就像留声机上的唱片
Like a record spinning on a turntable,

5
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:11,019
只不过  现在唱片一直在跳格
Only now, that record is skipping.

6
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:15,002
不管Linus在兰花站下做了什么
Whatever ben linus did down at the orchid station,

7
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,094
可能把我们驱逐了
It may have... dislodged us.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,058
从哪驱逐出去
Dislodged us from what?

9
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:20,086
时间
Time.

10
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,066
不是吧
Come on! aah!

11
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:28,047
根本不会停了
It's not stopping!

12
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,024
Charlotte
Charlotte!

13
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:38,054
我们要回兰花站
We have to go back to the orchid.

14
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:39,079
一切从那里开始
That's where all this started.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,008
或许能在那里结束
maybe it's where it'll stop.

16
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:42,057
会发生这一切  只因他们离开了
This is all happening because they left.

17
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:44,065
如果能把他们带回来  应该能停止
I think it'll stop if i can bring them back.

18
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,047
带谁回来
Bring who back?

19
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,076
Jack  Sun  Sayid  Hugo  Kate
Jack, sun, sayid, hugo, kate.

20
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:50,047
你难道不想让她回来吗
don't you want her to come back?

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,003
你确定不要我们拉你下去
You sure you don't want us to lower you down?

22
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,070
那就没意思了
Where would be the fun in that?

23
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:08,023
John  妈的  抓紧
John! damn it, hold on!

24
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:15,026
可以放手了
I think you can let go of that now.

25
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:23,045
不
No.

26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,030
不  不  不
No! no! no! no! no!

27
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,021

28
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:31,066
快点  帮我
Come on! help me!

29
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:33,072
James
James...

30
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:35,059
别挖了
Stop.

31
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,081
我们帮不了他
We can't help him.

32
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:40,060
不管John去了哪  他已经不见了
Wherever john went, he's gone.

33
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:44,022
不管我们在哪  那口井还没建呢
And wherever we are is before that well was ever built.

34
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:46,033
而且相当久远
Yeah, i'd say way before.

35
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:49,064
你怎么
What makes you--

36
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,043
James
James!

37
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:13,090
能听到我说话吗
Can you hear me?!

38
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:16,023
有人吗
Can anyone hear me?!

39
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:52,077
究竟怎么回事
What the hell was that?

40
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,072
这次不一样
That one was different. it was...

41
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:58,092
简直跟地震一样
That was more like an earthquake.

42
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:03,043
-Locke  -James  等等
Locke! james, wait!

43
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:15,032
真好
Great.

44
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:26,008
我的头不疼了
My headache is gone.

45
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:28,027
我的也是
Yeah, mine is, too.

46
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,057
鼻子也不留血了
And my nose isn't bleeding anymore.

47
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:41,051
看来结束了
I think it's over.

48
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:45,072
看来John成功了
I think john did it.

49
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:52,078
现在怎么办
Now what?

50
00:03:56,044 --> 00:04:00,045
我们等他回来
Now we wait for him to come back.

51
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,047
等多久
For how long?

52
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:11,075
要多久等多久
As long as it takes.

53
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:17,065
三年后
Three Years Later

54
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:42,064
有没有搞错
Are you kidding me?

55
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:44,012
我才离开10分钟  你们就跳起舞来了
I'm gone ten minutes, and you're having a

56
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:46,053
别这么扫兴嘛
hootenanny? Don't be such a bummer,man.

57
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:48,042
Rosie才刚刚进入状态
Rosie was just droppin' off some brownies.

58
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:50,019
你应该谢谢她
You should thank her. yeah.

59
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,029
她不该来这里  Jerry  我们在值班呢
She shouldn't be here, jerry. we're on the clock, man.

60
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:57,010
放松点  Phil  能出什么事啊
Ah, mellow out, phil. w-what's gonna happen, huh?

61
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,090
北极熊又不会从笼子里跑出来
The polar bears are gonna figure a way out

62
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,044
这个不是重点
of their cages? That's not the point.

63
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,076
要是被Lafleur知道了
If lafleur finds outwhat you're doing

64
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,008
Lafleur不会知道的
lafleur's not gonna find out anything.

65
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,001
吃亏的人是我
It's gonna be my ass, man.

66
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,025
-我才是要向他汇报的人  -伙计们
I'm the one who's gonna have to answer to him. guys?

不知道
I don't know.

Horace?

73
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,055
他手里有炸药
Oh, he's got dynamite. aah!

74
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:46,010
带她出去  快带她出去
Get her out of here! get her out of here now! now!

75
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,019

Come on, rosie. You gotta get outta here now.Don't tell anyone you were here.

76
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,098
我跟你说了别带她来
I told you not to bring her here. i told you!

77
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,011
快走  糟了

-吵醒他  -当然不想
wake laflr up? No, of course not, but--

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,068
或者我们自己解决
No, no, no. maybe--maybe we can handle this ourselves,

82
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:56,075
要是Horace把自己炸了
And maybe Horace blows himself up,

83
00:05:56,075 --> 00:06:00,095
Lafleur就会怪我们没叫醒他  快走
And lafleur kills us for not waking him. we gotta go now!

84
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:11,007

他干嘛这么做
Why's he doing that?

108
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,057
因为带了炸药呗
'cause he's loaded.

109
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:36,025
Horace什么时候开始喝酒了
Since when does horace drink?

110
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:39,049
没喝  所以要保持低调别让人知道
He doesn't, so we're gonna keep this on the down low.

111
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:54,057
天啊
Oh, man.

这是私事
It's personal.

128
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:50,052
隐私对吧  你认为人家不会知道
Personal? you think this isn't gonna get out?

129
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:54,044
等到早餐时,就人尽皆知了

00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:56,029
她不在了
She's not here.

145
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:59,081
她...
She...

146
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:02,013
她不见了
She's gone.

147
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:04,001
去哪里了
Where?

148
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:07,000
她...死了
She's... dead.

149
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:09,071
她死了
She's dead.

150
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,022
刚又闪了一次亮光  然后
There was another flash, and...

151
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,083
她就不见了
And she was... she was just gone.

152
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,025
她的尸体就
Her... body just...

153
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:24,001
消失了
Disappeared.

154
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:30,051
她被亮光闪走了  我们留下了
She moved on, and we stayed.

155
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,079
我很难过
I'm so sorry.

156
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:37,092
等等  你说我们"留下了"
Hold on. wait a minute. we "stayed"?

157
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:39,044
我们不会再穿梭时间了吗
We're not traveling through time

158
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:40,080
结束了吗
anymore? you say it's over?

159
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:43,003
当然结束了
Of course it's over.

160
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,010
不管我们现在在哪
Wherever we are now...

161
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:49,077
不管现在是哪个时间
Whenever we are now...

162
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,048
我们永远留下了
We're here for good.

163
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:03,026
-我不会那样做的  -好了
-I won't do it. -okay. okay.

164
00:11:03,032 --> 00:11:06,031
-我不会的  -好了
-I won't. i'm not gonna-- i'm--i'm... -okay.

165
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:13,009
太好了
Okay. swell.

166
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:16,026
等Dan回过神来 我们应该回海滩
Until dan checks back in, I say we head back to the beach.

167
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,028
等Locke带所有人回来时
When locke gets back with everybody,

168
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:20,040
-他们会在那里找我们  -海滩吗
-That's where they'll be looking for us. -the beach?

169
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:23,053
难道你还没挨够火箭啊
What, you didn't get enough flaming arrows shot at you?

170
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,073
你的帐篷都不在了  何必呢
And your camp is gone. why bother?

171
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,025
Sawyer说得对  Miles
Sawyer's right, Miles.

172
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:32,085
我们应该回海滩
We should go back to the beach.

173
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,066
我们可以再次生活在那里
We survived there before. we can do

174
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,050
-和以前一样  -说不定到了那里
-it again. -or maybe when we get there

175
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:38,083
你们又想回兰花站了
You'll--you'll wanna go back to the orchid again.

176
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,000
等在那里呆烦了
And then when that gets boring,

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,005
我们又可以回海滩
we can back to the beach.

178
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:43,066
你们只有这2个选择
It's the only two plans you people have.

179
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:46,058
收起你这套  我要去海滩了
Hey, zip it. i'm heading back to the beach.

180
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:49,070
帐篷在那好  不在我们就再建一个
If our stuff's there, great. if not, we build new stuff.

181
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,017
你不喜欢  就祝你好运
You don't like the plan, good luck.

182
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:58,019
他还领导上我们了
Who put him in charge?

183
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,079
谢谢你刚才为我说话
Thanks for getting my back for that whole beach issue.

184
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:14,061
你确实该谢我  这是个愚蠢的方案
You should thank me. it was a stupid idea.

185
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,040
那你干嘛要同意
Well, what does that say about you agreeing with me?

186
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:20,049
这样总比没计划好
Any plan is better than no plan.

187
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,057
另外  如果我不同意你
Besides, if i hadn't agreed with you,

188
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:24,066
我们现在还在争论下一步该怎样走
We'd still be arguing about where to go next.

189
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,088
我只是希望在我们到达海滩之前
I just hope you figure out something better

190
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:31,084
-你能想出更好的办法  -我虚心接受意见
-Before we get there. -well, i'm open to suggestions.

191
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:54,068
不  不  Paul  天呐
Oh, no! no, paul! oh, god! oh, god! no, no, no, no!

192
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:57,000
别  求你了  我们不知道
No, please! we didn't know!

193
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:01,032
Paul  求你了  阻止他
Paul, please, please do something. no, no.

194
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:05,003
别  别  我们只是来游玩的
No, no, no, no, no. we were just touring this park.

195
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,064
我们没别的意思  我们只是...Paul
We didn't mean anything. we were just having--paul.

196
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:09,090
Paul  求你了
Paul, please.

197
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:13,034
啊  天呐  别
Oh, my god! no!

198
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,019
别  Paul 求你了
No, paul, please. please.

199
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,014
你认为他们是谁
Who do you think they are?

200
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:19,013
无所谓  我们都不知道他们在什么时间
Who cares who they are? we don't even know when they are.

201
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,032
Dan
Dan.

202
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,060
我们不要介入  对吧  你之前是这么说的吧
We don't get involved, right? that's what you said.

203
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:30,011
我们做什么都无所谓了
Doesn't matter what we do.

204
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,094
该发生的终究会发生
Whatever happened, happened.

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,006
好  谢谢你  柏拉图
Yeah, thanks anyway, plato.

206
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:39,012
我要过去  你还会帮我吧
I'm going over there. you still got my back?

207
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,007
当然
Absolutely.

208
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:46,035
-Paul  醒醒啊  -跪下
-Paul, paul. talk to me! talk to me, paul! -on your feet!

209
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,095
-别  我不  -起来  快
-No, i can't! i can't! -come on, get up! now!

210
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,035
起来
up!

211
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,006
放下武器
All right, drop the gun!

212
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,031
天呐
Oh, god.

213
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:22,026
没事了
It's all right.

214
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:26,070
没事了  你安全了
It's okay. you're safe. it's over.

215
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,030
你是谁
Who are you?

216
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,061
她的朋友穿着达摩连衣裤
Her friend's wearing a dharma jumpsuit.

217
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,094
也就是70或80年代
That put us '70s, '80s.

218
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:54,086
-带着包的家伙  是其他人吗  -难倒我了
-The guys with the bags-- others? -beats me.

219
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:58,020
-你和他们不认识吗  -他们不在我的时代
-What, y'all don't know each other? -before my time.

220
00:14:58,026 --> 00:14:59,090
Sawyer
Sawyer.

221
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,029
对讲机
Walkie.

222
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:04,095
我们得走了
We need to go.

223
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,054
马上来
I'm on it.

224
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:11,079
听着  我们要走了
Listen, sweetheart, we gotta get moving now.

225
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:14,067
你们是谁
Who are you people?

226
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:16,079
我们的船在去塔希提岛的航线上失事了
Our ship wrecked here on the way to tahiti.

227
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:18,088
但现在不重要了
But that ain't important right now,

228
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:20,096
因为对讲机另一边的人
'cause whoever's on the other end of this--

229
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,045
他们可能在我们救你前给那边的人通过话
Those two might've given 'em a call before we saved you.

230
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:26,084
我们得埋掉他们
We have to bury them.

231
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,025
埋掉吗  我们没时间
Bury them? we ain't got time to bury nobody.

232
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:30,085
我们必须埋  有停战协议
we--we--we have to. The truce.

233
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:32,076
天呐
Oh, god.

234
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:35,005
我们得埋掉他们
We have to bury them.

235
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,052
而且我们得
And--and we have...

236
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:39,019
我们得
We have...

237
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,051
把他带回家
And we have to bring it-- him back home.

238
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,096
我们得带上Paul
We have to bring paul back with us.

239
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,063
求你了
Please.

240
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,086
求你了
Please?

241
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:51,094
求你们了
Please.

242
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,056
我来扛他
I'll carry him.

243
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:02,001
好吧  我们埋掉他们
All right, we'll put these guys in the ground

244
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:04,011
带你的朋友回去  但必须抓紧时间
And carry your friend back, but we better do it fast.

245
00:16:04,018 --> 00:16:06,061
他不是我的朋友
He wasn't... my friend.

246
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,014
他是我的丈夫
He was my husband.

247
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,084
好吧  听好了
All right, listen up.

248
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:28,073
我们到那之后  将会出现一连串问题
When we get there, there's gonna be a lot of questions.

249
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,045
到时你只需要把嘴闭上
So just keep your mouth shut.

250
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,020
我来跟他们谈
Let me do the talking.

251
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:32,066
你确定你能让他们相信
Do you really think you can convince them

252
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,005
我们沉船了吗
That we were in a boat wreck?

253
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:37,038
我是专家级的  欺骗是我赖以生存的技能
I'm a professional. I used to lie for a living.

254
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:38,084
Daniel  等等
Daniel! Stop!

255
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,034
把它关了
Turn it off.

256
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,042
-把什么关了  -不管是什么  反正给我关了
- Turn what off?  - Whatever that is.

257
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,014
可能是什么音波围墙之类的东西
It looks like some sort of sonic fence or something.

258
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:10,024
你刚说你们的船要去哪
Where did you say your ship was going?

259
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,003
听着 妹子  我们救了你的命 并且掩盖了那些尸体
Listen, sister, we're the ones who just saved your life And hid those bodies.

260
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,044
你还是相信我们  然后把那个东西关掉吧
So how about you trust us and turn that damn thing off?

261
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:19,059
好吧
Okay.

262
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,040
好  可以
Okay, fine.

263
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:35,083
音波围墙  我之前说过了由我来说话  记得吗
"Sonic fence"? Didn't I say let me do the talking?

264
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,039
再走一步  Dan的脑袋就烧焦了
One more step, Dan would've fri his brain.

265
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,076
他大脑早烧焦了
His brain has already been fried.

266
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,016
好了  关掉了
Okay, it's off.

267
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,059
你先走
You first.

268
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:59,071
看到吗  没问题的
See? it's fine.

269
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:02,066
好吧  我们走
All right, let's go.

270
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:04,051
我们继续走  大家做好自己的事情
And going forward, we should all do a better job.

271
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:20,016
三年后
Three Years Later

272
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:26,047
太疼了
It hurts!

273
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:29,088
你会好起来了的 Amy  放松一点
You're gonna be okay, Amy. Just try and relax.

274
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:33,001
Horace在哪
Where's Horace?

275
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:36,025
-他知道他的妻子临产吗  -他来不了
- Does he know his wife's in labor?  - He's unavailable.

276
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:37,054
听着  Amy的处境现在十分危险
Look, Amy's in a very dangerous situation.

277
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:39,087
-因为婴儿是臀位分娩  -什么意思
- The baby's breech.  - What the hell that means?

278
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:41,028
它是颠倒的  她需要剖腹产
It's upside down. She needs a caesarean.

279
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:43,027
别跟我说这么多  你就赶紧做吧
Well, don't tell me about it. Just do it.

280
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:44,094
我只是个内科医生  不是产科医生
I'm an internist, not an obstetrician.

281
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,041
我们的女性一般会在大陆进行接生
Our women always deliver on the mainland.

282
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:48,052
Amy本应在周二生产
Amy was supposed to get on the sub on tuesday.

283
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:50,098
婴儿比预期早到了两周
The baby's two weeks early.

284
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,088
-你到底能否为这个婴儿接生  -我不知道
- Can you deliver this baby or not?  - I don't know.

285
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:08,077
兄弟  她人呢
Hey, man. Where is she?

286
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:22,032
-怎么了  -Amy正在生孩子
- What's up?  -Amy's having her baby.

287
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,069
什么
What?

288
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:25,046
你听见没有
Did you hear me?

289
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,020
她遇到麻烦了
She's in trouble.

290
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:29,091
医生说她需要剖腹产
Doc says she needs a caesarean.

291
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:33,004
我们有协议的  别管你的协议了
We had an agreement. screw our agreement.

292
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,002
他从来没做过接生  我想你应该做过
He ain't never done one. i'm guessing you have.

293
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,011
你难道不明白吗
Don't you understand that every time

294
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:41,024
在岛上为女人接生
I try to help a woman on this island give birth,

295
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:43,092
是不会成功的
It hasn't worked?

296
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,074
这次没尝试过
Well, maybe whatever made that happen

297
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,049
你怎么就知道一定会失败
Hasn't happened yet.

298
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:51,081
你得试试  你得帮她
You gotta try. You gotta help her.

299
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:53,096
你是唯一一个能帮她的人
You're the only one that can.

300
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,048
婴儿的臀位分娩
The baby's breech.

301
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:06,029
-是的  -你试过外回转术吗
- Yes, but-- - Did you try an external cephalic version?

302
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,000
-什么  没有  -可能也太晚了
- What? No.  - I-- It's probably too late.

303
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:10,009
我需要一个12号手术刀以及14厚度的缝线
I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel, 14-gauge sutures--

304
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:13,069
要半圆的  以及硬脑膜外麻醉剂
Half-round if you've got them-- and an epidural anesthetic.

305
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:15,055
你需要这些吗  Horace到底在哪
You're gonna need? where is horace?

306
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:17,025
我正在表达Horace的意见
I'm speaking for Horace now,

307
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:19,015
她正在为Amy接生这个婴儿
And I say she's delivering this baby.

308
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,085
我不认同这种做法
I don't think it's a good idea.

309
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:23,059
我要她帮我接生
I want her to do it

310
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,053
你听到了没有
You heard the lady.

311
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:36,083
听着  你一定要做好了
Listen... you're gonna do great.

312
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:39,010
我知道你可以的
I know you are.

313
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,098
好吧
Okay.

314
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:02,018
没事吧
Is everything okay?

315
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,092
Amy正在分娩
Amy went into labor.

316
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,080
我知道
I know.

317
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,089
她还好吧
Is she okay?

318
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,097
我不知道  出现了个问题
I don't know. There's a problem.

319
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:11,082
-Juliet在里面  -Juliet
- Juliet's in there.  - Juliet?

320
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:14,081
我让她过来帮忙了
I pulled her out of retirement.

321
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:19,019
有什么消息么
Any luck?

322
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,048
今天我们完成了1-3-3
We finished grid 1-3-3 today.

323
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:23,084
没发现我们的人
No sign of our people.

324
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:25,093
一个也没有
No one.

325
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,044
那再试试1-3-4吧
Well, 1-3-4 then.

326
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:34,021
我们还得持续多久  James
How long do we look, James?

327
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:36,078
继续下去吧
As long as it takes.

328
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:46,048
怎么了
What happened?

329
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,085
是个男孩
It's a boy.

330
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:52,045
母子平安吗
He's okay? She's okay?

331
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:56,007
都很好
Everyone's okay.

332
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:20,089
你头怎么样了
How's your head?

333
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:23,043
很疼
It hurts.

334
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,096
-我们的人呢  -他们很好
- Where are my people?  -They're fine.

335
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,013
Amy告诉我在丛林里发生的事情了
Amy told me what happened in the jungle,

336
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:32,081
我很感激你的所作所为
And I really appreciate what you did.

337
00:22:32,087 --> 00:22:35,058
你的感激方式真的很特别
Well, y'all got a funny way of showing your appreciation.

338
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:37,067
我们有一些自卫的礼仪
We have certain defense protocols.

339
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:41,000
因为有许多不友善的土著人在这个岛上
There are hostile indigenous people on this island,

340
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:43,009
我们无法与他们正常相处
And we don't get along with them.

341
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:47,057
你还是告诉我你到底是谁吧
So... why don't you tell me who the hell you are?

342
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:52,023
我叫James Lafleur  你可以叫我Jim
My name's James Lafleur. you can call me Jim.

343
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,074
你怎么来到这个岛上的  Jim
How'd you get to the island, Jim?

344
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,080
如果我的朋友们没事  你干嘛问我这么多问题
If my friends are safe, why are you asking me all the questions.

345
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,080
他们告诉我要跟你谈
They told me I need to talk to you,

346
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:03,088
因为你是船长
That you're the boat captain.

347
00:23:03,094 --> 00:23:07,011
我们遇到了一场暴风雨
We got caught in a storm.

348
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,020
我们的船沉了
Our ship wrecked.

349
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:11,042
我们撞到了暗礁上
Must've hit the reef.

350
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,048
谢天谢地  我们被冲到了海岸上
Thankfully, we washed up on shore.

351
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:16,092
是什么样的船
What kind of ship?

352
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:19,027
一个救助打捞船
A salvage vessel.

353
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:22,016
打捞知名沉船用的
Searching for a famous lost wreck.

354
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:24,098
是一艘贩运奴隶的船  来自英格兰的朴茨茅斯
It's an old slaver out of Portsmouth, England,

355
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,082
名叫  Black Rock
Called "the black rock."

356
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,094
你听说过么
You heard of her?

357
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,041
没听说过
Can't say that I have.

358
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:34,094
你被冲到了海岸上
So... once you got washed ashore,

359
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:38,011
那你为何又会在丛林里游荡
Why were you then wandering around in the jungle?

360
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,024
我们的一些船员失踪了  我们正在找他们
Some of our crew were missin'. We were looking for 'em.

361
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:44,080
后来我们就遇到了你的人  Amy
That's when we came upon your girl instead.

362
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,021
我告诉你吧  Jim
Well... I tell you what, Jim.

363
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,015
你们的人一出现  我们就会
If your crew shows up, we'll send

364
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,040
把你跟他们一起送到大溪地去
'em along with yaou off in Tahiti.

365
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,017
送到哪儿去
Send them where?

366
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:55,099
那里有搜潜艇 一大早就离岛
There's a submarine That leaves this island first thing in the morning.

367
00:23:56,006 --> 00:23:58,060
你和你的朋友们  一定要上艇
You and your friends, you're gonna get on it.

368
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:01,004
潜艇会把你们送到大溪地
It's gonna drop you off in Tahiti.

369
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,068
从那儿你们就能回家了
You can find your way home from there.

370
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,027
等一下  Jim
Hold on a minute, Jim.

371
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:07,014
我们刚刚救了那女的一命
We just saved that woman's life.

372
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:09,033
能不能换一两个礼拜
Doesn't that earn us a week or two

373
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,043
-让我们找找其他人  -不行
- To find the rest of our people? - Nope.

374
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:13,052
只有授权居住在围场里的人
Only people that are allowed to stay on this compound

375
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:15,061
才是Dharma组织的成员
Are members of the Dharma Initiative.

376
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:18,017
而且  以防你误解
And look, i don't want you to take this the wrong way,

377
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,049
不好意思  Jim  你不够资格进Dharma
Please, jim, but you are not Dharma material.

378
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:29,010
咱们上当了
We're screwed.

379
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:32,023
他现在八成在使劲解释时空旅行
He's probably trying to explain time travel by now.

380
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,042
Sawyer不会有事的
Sawyer's gonna be fine.

381
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:36,075
你怎么看
What are you lookin' at?

382
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:43,007
我在这里住了3年多
I lived here for over three years.

383
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,016
那栋就是我的房子
That was my house over there.

384
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,059
你难道是Dharma组织的
You were in the Dharma Initiative?

385
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,064
不是
No.

386
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,073
后来  其他人夺取了这个兵营
The others took over these barracks

387
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,047
除掉了住在这里的绝大部分人
And wiped out most of the people living in them.

388
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:58,011
很久以后  我才被他们用潜艇带到岛上
They brought me here on a sub a long time after that.

389
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:01,058
那么...欢迎回家
Well... welcome home.

390
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:07,056
Daniel  还能想起来什么吗
Daniel... no more flash?

391
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:13,009
想不起来
No.

392
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:14,083
什么也想不起来
No more flash.

393
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,037
唱片又开始旋转
The record is spinning again.

394
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:23,070
我们不得不收听这首我们根本不想听的歌
We're just not on the song we wanna be on.

395
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:29,030
-爸爸呢  -过来  宝贝
- Where's dad? - Come on, love.

"Mr. Lafleur"?

402
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,040
我瞎说的  现编的
It's creole. improvised.

403
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:04,084
你俩都说什么了

404
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,030
他相信了我说的故事  但是他撒手不管咱们了
Well, he believed my story. But we're gettin' punted.

405
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:10,067

I wish you would've told me you were coming.

416
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:57,039
那样的话  我可以帮你把栅栏撤了
I would've turned the fence off for you.

417
00:27:57,046 --> 00:28:00,098
栅栏能隔开很多东西  但是隔不开我们
That fence may keep other things out, but not us.

418
00:28:02,004 --> 00:28:04,061
Horace  唯一能隔开咱俩的
The only thing that does keep us out, Horace,

419
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:06,084
只有休战
Is our truce...

420
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:08,050
而你打破了休战协议
Which you've now broken.

421
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:11,039
我不明白你指的是什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

422
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:14,013
我那两个人呢
Where are my two men?

423
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:19,057
你们绝不觉得
You know what?

424
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:23,049
上潜艇这事越听越像个好主意了
Gettin' on that sub is starting to sound like a great idea.

425
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:25,014
你们觉得怎么样  上潜艇  有人有意见吗
What do you say? Sub. Anyone?

426
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:26,061
管住你那张嘴  班仔
Hold your horses, banzai.

427
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:27,073
我看没人会上潜艇
I think no one's gonna on that sub.

428
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:32,076
Lafleur  你能把那些尸体埋了吗
Okay, Lafleur, how well do you bury those bodies?

429
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:35,068
得看看他们硬没硬
Well, that depends on how hard he looks.

430
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:39,073
给箭羽站打电话  通知他们进入一级战备
Call the Arrow. Tell them we're at condition one.

431
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:43,021
带上重武器 确保围栏电量最大  
Take the heavy ordnance, and make sure the fence is at maximum.

432
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,004
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

433
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:46,086
-让我跟他谈谈  -你说什么
- Let me talk to him. - Excuse me?

434
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:49,017
就是外面那个画眼线的 让我跟他谈谈  
Your buddy out there with the eyeliner-- Let me talk to him.

435
00:28:49,017 --> 00:28:51,058
我们跟这些人有停战协议 你不清楚状况
We had a truce with these people. You don't understand.

436
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,079
我清楚状况 是我杀了他两个弟兄
I understand I'm the one that killed his men,

437
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,034
我现在就要出去
And I'm the man that's gonna go out there

438
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,011
告诉他我为什么这样做
And tell him why I did it.

439
00:28:56,095 --> 00:29:00,022
我可不是在跟你要许可
Well, it's a good thing I ain't asking your permission.

440
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,025
James  你确定自己在做什么吗
James, are you sure you know what you're doing?

441
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:07,084
不完全  但是我会弄清楚的
Not yet. But I'll figure somethin' out.

442
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,043
你好  Richard
Hello, Richard.

443
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:24,055
不好意思  咱们认识吗
I'm sorry. Do we know each other?

444
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:28,003
是我杀的你两个兄弟
I'm the guy that killed your men.

445
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,075
我当时听到枪声
Heard some gunshots,

446
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:34,047
看到两个男人向一位女士头上扔包
Saw two men throwing a bag over a woman's head.

447
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:37,060
我警告他们放下武器离开
Gave 'em a chance to throw the weapons down and walk away,

448
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,073
但是其中一人向我开枪  我就自我防卫了
But one of them took a shot at me, and i defended myself.

449
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,074
真是这样吗
Is that so?

450
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,065
真是这样
That's so.

451
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:47,054
你们的人知不知道你来跟我说这些
Your people know that you're telling me this?

452
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,050
他们不是我的人  所以如果你们之前有什么停战协议
They ain't my people, hoss. So if you got some kind

453
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:54,035
那就没被打破
Of a truce with them, it ain't been broken.

454
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,095
如果你不是Dharma组织的
If you're not a member of the Dharma Initiative,

455
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,077
那你是谁
Then what are you?

456
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,008
你把炸弹埋了吗
Did you bury the bomb?

457
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:11,049
就是那个上面写着大笨蛋的氢弹
The hydrogen bomb with "jughead" written on the side.

458
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:13,054
-你埋了吗  -你怎么...
- Did you bury it? - How...

459
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,001
我就是知道
Yeah, I know about it.

460
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:18,023
我还知道20年前
I also know that 20 years ago,

461
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:20,050
有个光头一瘸一拐走进你的营地
Some bald fella limped into your camp

462
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:23,048
胡言乱语  说要当你们的领袖
And fed you some mumbo jumbo about being your leader.

463
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,022
然后啪一下
And then poof...

464
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:28,004
他就在你眼前消失了
He went and disappeared right in front of ya.

465
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:30,019
想起来了吗
Any of this ringin' a bell?

466
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:35,002
那人叫John Locke
That man's name is John Locke,

467
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,069
我一直在等他回来
And I'm waitin' for him to come back.

468
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:39,092
那么
So...

469
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,099
你还觉不觉得我跟该死的Dharma组织是一伙的
You still think i'm a member of the damn Dharma Initiative?

470
00:30:44,005 --> 00:30:46,073
不
No.

471
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:48,055
我绝对不这样想
I guess i don't.

472
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:53,003
但是无论你是谁
But no matter who you are,

473
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,064
我两个弟兄死了
Two of my men are dead.

474
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:59,085
我的人民需要个说法
And my people need some kind of justice.

475
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:02,052
我们现在该怎么办
Now what are we gonna do about that?

476
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,004
Amy  你怎么样了
How are you doing, Amy?

477
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:23,039
他走了吗
Is he gone?

478
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:25,023
我是说Alpert
Alpert?

479
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:29,030
不  他没走  我告诉他尸体的埋藏地点
No, he's not gone. We told him where the bodies were.

480
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:31,028
你告诉他了  为什么
You told him? why?

481
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:33,001
情势所迫
We had to.

482
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:36,055
只有这样  才能保住停火协议
It was the only way to maintain the truce.

483
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,082
Jim和他一起促成了停火  但是
Jim here worked it out with him, but...

484
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:42,043
他现在要从我们这里拿点东西
Well, he's gonna need something from us now.

485
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:46,056
他要把Paul的尸体一块儿带回去
He needs to take Paul's body back with him.

486
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:50,033
不
No.

487
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:55,013
Ames
Hey, Ames.

488
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,093
听着
Listen, w--

489
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,022
我们是老朋友了  对吗
We've been friends for a long time, yeah?

490
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:03,036
所以选择权完全在你
So this is completely your choice.

491
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:06,049
如果你不想把他给他们
If you don't want to give him to them,

492
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:10,025
我们就得承担后果
Then we will suffer the consequences.

493
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:23,070
让他们带走吧
They can take him.

494
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,070
他想维护我们的安全
He would want to keep us safe.

495
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:36,063
我能单独和他待会儿吗
Can I have a minute, please?

496
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:06,083
对不起
I'm sorry.

497
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:16,072
需要帮忙吗
You need some help?

498
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,091
不  我自己能行  谢谢
Hmm? oh. nah, I've got it. Thanks.

499
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:26,038
Jim  潜艇明天早上出发
Hey, Jim, the sub leaving tomorrow morning--

500
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,074
两周以后回来
It returns in two weeks.

501
00:33:28,082 --> 00:33:30,034
到那之前
Until then,

502
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,075
你可以待在这里继续寻找剩下的人
You can stay and look for the rest of your crew.

503
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,001
谢谢
Thanks.

504
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:49,024
我为我们争取了两周的时间
I bought us two weeks.

505
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:53,045
Horace说我们可以等下一趟潜艇
Horace said we can wait for the next sub.

506
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:56,061
运气好的话  Locke到时会回来
Any luck, locke'll be back by then.

507
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:59,073
然后呢
And then what?

508
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:03,011
你问"然后呢"是什么意思
What do you mean, "then what"?

509
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:06,021
Locke说他马上就来救我们
Locke said he was leaving to save us.

510
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:08,066
闪光停止了
The flashes have stopped.

511
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:10,089
结束了
They're over.

512
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:13,060
不会再流鼻血了
No more bloody noses.

513
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:15,072
我们已经获救了
We're already saved.

514
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:17,080
你后面那趟潜艇把我带到这里来
That sub behind you brought me here.

515
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,002
三年来我都试图离开这个岛
I've been trying to get off of this island

516
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,023
现在我有机会了
For more than three years, and now I've got my chance.

517
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:27,019
我要离开
I'm going to leave.

518
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:36,003
你应该知道现在是1974年
You do realize it's 1974,

519
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:39,016
不管你想回到哪里...
That whatever it is you think you're going back to...

520
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,077
那儿都还不存在
It don't exist yet.

521
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,089
这不是留下来的理由
It's not a reason not to go.

522
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,065
好吧  那我怎么办
Well, what about me?

523
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:52,080
你真的想留下我和这个疯科学家
You really gonna leave me here with the mad scientist

524
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,082
和"我和死人说话"先生在一起
And Mr. "I speak to dead people"?

525
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:57,094
还有那个  这家伙真是个好人
And Jin, who's a hell of a nice guy

526
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:00,055
但实在不是健谈的人
But not exactly the greatest conversationalist.

527
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:02,032
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

528
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:03,088
也许
Maybe...

529
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:06,010
但是谁来带我回去呢
But who's gonna get my back?

530
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:16,043
别这样
Come on.

531
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,076
我全部要求就是  给我两周时间
Just give me two weeks, that's all I'm asking.

532
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,092
两周
Two weeks.

533
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:33,092
好吧  就两周
All right. two weeks.

534
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:45,080
三年后
Three years later

535
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:23,067
什么东西闻起来好香
Mmm, somethin' smells good.

536
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:25,058
你回来了
Hey there.

537
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,068
是给我的吗
Is that for me?

538
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,047
你今天真漂亮
You were amazing today.

539
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:57,072
谢谢你相信我
Thank you for believing in me.

540
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,091
我爱你
I love you.

541
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:17,043
我也爱你
I love you, too.

542
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:33,069
醒醒  老大
Wake up, boss.

543
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:40,037
你的头怎么样
How's your head?

544
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:41,099
好疼
It hurts.

545
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:46,086
我有好消息也有坏消息
I got good news and bad news.

546
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:48,067
你先听哪个
What you want first?

547
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:51,073
好消息
Good news.

548
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,051
你做爸爸了
You're a daddy.

549
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:58,089
坏消息是你错过了
Bad news is you missed it.

550
00:37:58,096 --> 00:38:02,030
天啊
Oh, gosh.

551
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:05,029
Amy  她生孩子了
Amy... she had the baby?

552
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:08,027
是个男孩
It's a boy.

553
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:10,043
男孩
A boy?

554
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,047
现在和我说说
Now how about you tell me

555
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:21,036
为什么你喝得酩酊大醉还大发脾气
Why you're too busy drinkin' and blowin' up trees

556
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:23,045
而没有看着他出生
To see him be born?

557
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,043
我在
I was, uh...

558
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,034
我在找双袜子
I was looking for a pair of socks,

559
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,074
我的都脏了
And all of mine were dirty,

560
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,081
所以我去拿一双Amy的  然后
So I went to grab a pair of amy's, and...

561
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:41,017
我就发现了这个
I found this...

562
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:43,047
在她抽屉的后面
In the back of her drawer.

563
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,004
这是Paul的
It was Paul's.

564
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,007
你就为了一条项链去打架
You got in a fight over a necklace?

565
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,073
我知道
I know.

566
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,013
但是
But...

567
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,001
只有三年而以  Jim
It's only been three years, Jim.

568
00:38:56,008 --> 00:39:00,012
他只离开了三年而以
Just three years that he's been gone.

569
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:04,029
这点时间真的足够忘掉一个人吗
Is that really long enough to get over someone?

570
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:13,047
我曾经有过一个女孩
I had a thing for a girl once.

571
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:18,086
而且我试过追求她
And I had a shot at her,

572
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:21,002
但是我没成功
But I didn't take it.

573
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,019
一段时间里  我每晚躺在床上
For a little while, I'd lay in bed every night,

574
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:28,087
都怀疑这是一场错误
Wondering if it was a mistake.

575
00:39:30,095 --> 00:39:33,032
怀疑
Wondering if...

576
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,099
我是否可以不再想她
I'd ever stop thinking about her.

577
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:43,099
而现在我几乎记不得她的样子
And now I can barely remember what she looks like.

578
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:49,006
她的脸...
I mean, her face--it's...

579
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:50,063
她离开了
She's just gone,

580
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:55,053
就再也没回来
And she ain't never coming back.

581
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,055
那么
So...

582
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,093
三年的时间足够忘掉一个人吗
Is three years long enough to get over someone?

583
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:07,080
绝对够了
Absolutely.

584
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:38,049
怎么啦
What?

585
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,087
等等  怎么啦
Wait. what?

586
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:44,060
不  不
H--no. no.

587
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,027
别让他们进来
Don't bring 'em in.

588
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:48,085
我们在北部峡谷见面
Just meet me in the north valley.

589
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:50,093
是谁啊
Who was it?

590
00:40:56,082 --> 00:40:59,043
James  怎么了
James, what's going on?

591
00:40:59,043 --> 00:41:00,055
是Jin
It was Jin.

592
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:01,034
没事吧
Is everything okay?

593
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:05,072
没事  我只是  我得去
Yeah. I just... I gotta go.
