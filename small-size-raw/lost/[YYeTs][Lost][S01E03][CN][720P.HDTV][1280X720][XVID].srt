00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:07,028
他能活下来吗?
Do you think he's gonna live?

4
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:09,062
你认识他?
Do you know him?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,032
他坐在我旁边
He was sitting next to me.

6
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:14,005
你以为他们会来吗
You'd think they would have come by now.

7
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,029
-谁?  -谁都行
-Who?  -Anyone.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,091
这和跳棋一样吗?
What is it, like checkers?

9
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:22,066
不太一样  它比跳棋好玩
Not really. It's a better game than checkers.

10
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:25,017
两个人游戏  分两边
Two players, two sides.

11
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:28,065
一方白子  一方黑子
One is light, one is dark.

12
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,087
Walt...

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,047
你想知道个秘密吗?
Do you want to know a secret?

14
00:00:57,044 --> 00:00:58,065
不要相信她
Don't trust her.

15
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:00,095
她是个危险人物
She's dangerous.

16
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:02,097
不要动
Try not to move, man.

17
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,035
我要找到她
I have to find her.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,070
我要把她带回来
I have to bring her back.

19
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:09,008
好吧  你继续说吧
Yeah, you keep saying that.

20
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:11,065
每次我问你把谁带回来时
And every time I ask you who you have to bring back,

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,008
你都会昏过去
you pass out on me again.

22
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,087
因为你在发高烧
Since your fever's running pretty high,

23
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:17,030
所以我猜你跟本不知道你在说谁
I'm guessing you have no idea who the hell you're talking about.

24
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:18,084
我的手铐
My cuffs.

25
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:20,074
我的手铐
My handcuffs.

26
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,052
我的手铐在哪?
Where are my cuffs?

27
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:25,030
什么?
What?

28
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:29,043
我的外衣兜
My jacket pocket.

29
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:31,034
-我不...  -我的外衣兜
-I don't...-My jacket pocket.

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,058
好吧
Okay.

31
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,089
危险
Dangerous.

32
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:45,060
她是危险人物
She's dangerous.

33
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:08,076
天开始黑了
It's getting dark.

34
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,007
那就加快脚步
Then pick up the pace.

35
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:11,069
-乡巴佬  -你敢再大点声?
-Hick.  -A little louder?

36
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,006
我们应该在这露营
We should make camp.

37
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:15,094
-什么  在这?  -是的  在这
-What, here?  -Yes, here.

38
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,070
我不会停下来的  你们在这好好的野餐一顿吧
I'm not stopping. Y'all have a nice cookout.

39
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:19,074
很好  在夜里穿过丛林
Excellent. Walk through the jungle in the dark.

40
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,075
怕树会吃了我们吗?
Ooh, afraid the trees are gonna get us?

41
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:24,072
不会  但摧毁树的东西会吃了你
No. What is knocking down the trees will get you.

42
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:26,012
好啊  你这么担心我
Well, you're so worried about me,

43
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,053
为什么不把弹夹给我?
how about you give me the clip back?

44
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,030
把枪收起来  Sawyer
Put your gun back in your pants, Sawyer.

45
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:32,053
Sayids是对的  如果继续走你也回不到沙滩的
Sayid's right. You keep walking, you're not gonna make it to the beach.

46
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,064
为什么
Yeah, why's that?

47
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,044
相信我
Trust me.

48
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,056
这是澳大利亚
This is Australia.

49
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,035
这是我们
This is us.

50
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,050
不错的棍子
Nice stick.

51
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:46,036
两天前  我们从悉尼起飞
Two da ago, we take off from Sydney.

52
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:49,031
我们沿着所有飞往洛杉矶的
We fly along the same northeast route

53
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,006
商务客机的东北航线飞行
every commercial airliner bound for los angeles does.

54
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:55,011
那个驾驶员  他说他和地面失去了联系  对吧?
Now, the pilot, he said he lost communication with the ground, correct?

55
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:56,056
是的  有6个小时
Yeah, six hours in.

56
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:58,027
他就调头驶向斐济了
He turned around and headed for Fiji.

57
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,082
就是说我们改变了航线
So he changed course.

58
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,060
遗憾的是  没人知道我们改变了航线
Regrettably, no one knew he changed course.

59
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,046
然后遇到了气流
The turbulence hit.

60
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,051
下面的事我们都知道了
We know the rest.

61
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,097
那个飞行员说我们离航线有一千多英里远
The pilot said we were over 1,000 miles off course.

62
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,055
没错  但他们会找到我们的
Yeah, but they'll find us.

63
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:19,003
他们的卫星可以清楚的拍到你的车牌号码
They have satellites in space that can take pictures of your license plate.

64
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,034
如果我们都带着车牌就行
If only we were all wearing license plates.

65
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,059
你可是个悲观主义者
Well, aren't you the pessimist.

66
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:25,046
基本的摄影技巧...对准然后再拍
Basic photography...point and shoot.

67
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:28,005
卫星是可以拍照  但它们要知道拍哪
Satellites can shoot,but they must be told where to point.

68
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,014
妈的
Bollocks.

69
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:35,029
戏做的不错  很好看
Okay, really enjoyed the puppet show. Fantastic.

70
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:37,044
我们被困在了一个无人知晓的地方
So we're stuck in the middle of damn nowhere.

71
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:40,080
我们谈谈别的怎么样?
How about we talk about that other thing?

72
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:44,052
无线电接收器收到的信号
You know, the transmission Abdul picked up on his little radio.

73
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:47,039
那法国婊子说"他们都死了"
The French chick that said "they're all dead."

74
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:50,093
信号已经发射了... 多长时间  Kate?
The transmission's been on a loop for...how long was it, freckles?

75
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:54,036
-16年  -没错
-16 years.  -Right.

76
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:57,023
我们谈谈这个吧
Let's talk about that.

77
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:04,044
我们回去要把这些告诉大家
Well, we have to tell the others when we get back.

78
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:06,068
-告诉他们什么?  -我们所听到的
-Tell them what exactly?  -What we heard.

79
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:08,045
你听到什么了?  我可不是个愚蠢的翻译
You didn't hear anything. I'm not a stupid translator.

80
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,019
谁也不可以告诉大家任何事
No one's going to tell them anything.

81
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:13,056
散播我们所听到的
To relay what we heard

82
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,044
却又没有完全理解的东西  会造成大家的恐慌
without fully understanding it will cause a panic.

83
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,047
如果我们告诉他们我们知道的
If we tell them what we know,

84
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:22,040
我们就会带走他们的希望
we take away their hope.

85
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:27,078
失掉希望是件很可怕的事情
And hope is a very dangerous thing to lose.

86
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,065
所以我们要说谎
So we lie.

87
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:39,095
-是恐龙吗?  -不是恐龙
-Was it a dinosaur?  -It wasn't a dinosaur.

88
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:41,011
你说你没看见它?
You said you didn't see it.

89
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,011
没有
I didn't.

90
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,015
那你怎么知道它不是恐龙?
So how do you know it wasn't a dinosaur?

91
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:48,017
因为恐龙已经灭绝了
Because dinosaurs are extinct.

92
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,046
他怎么样了?
So what's his story?

93
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:58,092
他看起来像是...
He looks kind of...

94
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,088
快死了
dying.

95
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,063
-他不会死的  -伤口已经化脓了
-He's not gonna die.  -He's yellow, man.

96
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,025
他的伤口是感染了  但抗生素会解决的
His wound is infected, but the antibiotics will fight it off.

97
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,029
如果它们解决不了呢?
hat if they don't?

98
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:10,058
那他的身体就停止工作了
Then his body will shut down

99
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,070
一件一件的停止
one piece at a time.

100
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:15,005
他的腹部开始僵化  然后...
His abdomen goes rigid, then...

101
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,062
看起来他很疼
He looks like he's in pain.

102
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,057
这是什么?
What's this?

103
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:34,036
老兄?
Dude?

104
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,074
你认为她做了什么?
What do you think she did?

105
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:43,000
这不关我的事
It's none of my business.

106
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,025
-她看起来像中坚分子  -Hurley
-She looks pretty hardcore.  -Hurley.

107
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,010
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,006
我在站岗
I'm standing guard.

109
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:30,094
你听到他们是怎么说的吗?
You heard what they said's out there.

110
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:34,052
你从没拿过枪的  他是反对枪的
You've never even held a gun. He doesn't believe in guns.

111
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,033
-他去游行过  -我没游行过
-He goes on marches.  -I don't go on marches.

112
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:38,086
是的  把它给Al-jazeera  他会保护我们的
Yeah, give it to Al-jazeera. He'll protect us.

113
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,096
Al-jazeera是一种网络
Al-jazeera's a network.

114
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:42,007
-让我来保管  -我们应该给她
-I'll keep the damn gun.  -We should give it to her.

115
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,052
是的
Yeah.

116
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:51,009
枪应该由Kate保管
Kate should hold the gun.

117
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:52,008
我同意
Fine with me.

118
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:56,052
好啊?
Well?

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,083
-早安  -早安
-Good morning.  -Morning.

120
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:19,099
你睡在了我的羊圏里
You're sleeping in my sheep pen.

121
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,067
对不起
Sorry.

122
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,023
你怎么来这的?
How'd you get here?

123
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,098
-走来的  -你走来的?
-I walked.  -You walked?

124
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:31,048
-是的  -从哪?
-Yeah.  -From where?

125
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:35,028
-小镇  -离这最近的小镇也有15公里
-Town.  -Nearest town's 15 kilometers.

126
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:37,008
也许正因如此我才这么累吧
Maybe that's why I'm so exhausted.

127
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:38,014
你叫什么?
What's your name?

128
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,054
Annie

129
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,050
你饿吗  Annie?
You hungry, Annie?

130
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:51,000
想告诉我你为什么侵入我的地方吗?
So, you want to tell me why you're trespassing on my property?

131
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:53,050
我钱用光了
I ran out of money.

132
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,057
你是美国人?
You're an American?

133
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,045
加拿大人
Canadian.

134
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,040
我大学毕业后  想出去见见世界
I graduated from college and figured I'd see the world.

135
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,018
澳大利亚是我最想去的  所以我就登上了去墨尔本的飞机
Australia was top of my list,so I hopped a flight to Melbourne,

136
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:05,060
但我这里没有一个熟人
but I don't know anybody here,

137
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:07,064
所以我就到处走了走
so I just figured I'd walk for a while,you know?

138
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:10,061
墨尔本离这有几百公里
Melbourne's a hundred kilometers from here.

139
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,017
我喜欢走路
I like walking.

140
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:15,092
然后你就走到了我的农场?
And you just happened to wander onto my farm?

141
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:17,082
我也喜欢农场
I like farms, too.

142
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,067
你知道怎样料理农场吗?
Do you know how to work one?

143
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,032
知道
Yeah.

144
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:36,059
我妻子8个月前的礼拜三去世了
My wife died eight months ago wednesday.

145
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,084
她为我留下了太多的家务和债务
She left me with too many chores and a hell of a mortgage.

146
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,095
你能帮我处理前者吗?
If you help me with the first one,

147
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,020
我会为你提供住处并付你合理的薪水的
I'll give you a fair wage and a place to stay.

148
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,027
成交
Deal.

149
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,029
我是个左撇子
I'm a lefty.

150
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:01,044
老兄! 老兄!
Dude ! Dude !

151
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:05,035
他们回来了
They're back.

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,040
正如你们所知道的
As you and the others know,

153
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,017
我们爬上了山,以便帮助救援队找到我们
we hiked up the mountain in an attempt to help the rescue team locate us.

154
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:17,062
无线电接收器没有收到信号
The transceiver failed to pick up a signal.

155
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,042
我们无法发射求救信号
We weren't able to send out a call for help.

156
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,032
但我们不能放弃
But we're not giving up.

157
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,073
如果我们收集一下电子设备
If we gather electronic equipment

158
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,039
比如手机  笔记本电脑...
your cell phones, laptops...

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,052
我可以使信号增强  然后再次尝试
I can boost the signal and we can try again.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,019
但这可能需要一些时间  所以从现在开始
But that may take some time, so for now,

161
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:34,046
我们要合理分配剩下的食物
we should begin rationing our remaining food.

162
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,055
如果下雨了  我们要撘帆布来收集雨水
If it rains, we should set up tarps to collect water.

163
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,069
我要你们分成3组
I need to organize three separate groups.

164
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,032
每个组都要有个领队
Each group should have a leader.

165
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,048
一组负责找水  由我来负责
One group for water. I'll organize that.

166
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:47,085
谁来组织收集电子设备?
Who's going to organize electronics?

167
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,066
你...配给食物?
You...rationing food?

168
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:52,033
好吧
Okay.

169
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:57,039
我需要第三组来搭设他们的...
And I will need a third group to concern themselves with the construction of...

170
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,021
我  嗯... 我有事要告诉你
I, um... I need to tell you something.

171
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:08,090
好的
Okay. Sure.

172
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:16,077
我们不能发射信号是因为
We couldn't send out a signal because

173
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:19,023
被另外一个信号阻挡了
there was another signal blocking it.

174
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:23,026
另一个信号...
The other signal...

175
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,033
我们听到了
we heard it.

176
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,065
是一个法国女子的求救信号
It was a distress call from a French woman.

177
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,013
她说其他人都死了
She said that the others were dead.

178
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:34,049
有东西把他们都杀了
That something had killed them all.

179
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:37,024
她在岛上独自一人
She was alone on the island.

180
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:42,020
信号已经发射了16年  Jack
It's been playing for 16 years, Jack.

181
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,042
我需要告诉你
I wanted to tell you.

182
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:02,024
没别的了?
Anything else?

183
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:11,024
他怎么样了?
How is he?

184
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,063
那个身中弹片的人
The man with the shrapnel in his side.

185
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,063
形势很严峻
He's touch and go.

186
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:20,001
他醒了吗?
Did he wake up?

187
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:23,037
没有  只是在手术时醒了几秒
Nah, just for a few seconds during the surgery.

188
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,036
他说什么了吗?
He say anything?

189
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,021
没
No.

190
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:47,009
她说什么了?
So what'd she say?

191
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,041
什么都没说
She didn't say anything.

192
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,045
你告诉她你知道了吗
But you told her you knew.

193
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:57,020
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

194
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:59,007
你知道她的那张疑犯照片
Well, you kinda know she's in that mug shot.

195
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:01,043
还有那副手铐
And that we found those handcuffs.

196
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:05,006
那人不停的念叨"她是危险人物"
And that guy keeps mumbling "she's dangerous,she's dangerous" over and over.

197
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:08,076
这不关我的事  和我无关
It's not my business. Not my problem.

198
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:15,025
没错  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

199
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,087
等Johnny Fever好了  让他去处理吧
We'll let Johnny Fever take care of her when he gets better.

200
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:22,069
如果我们找不到更强的抗生素 他不会好起来的
He's not getting better if we don't get some stronger antibiotics.

201
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:26,012
-我从行李里找到的那个  -那是治耳朵感染和脚气的
-That stuff I got from the luggage... -It's for ear infections and foot fungus.

202
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,079
我都找遍了
I went through everything, man.

203
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,024
上面的机厢里会不会有?
What about that luggage in the overhead compartments?

204
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,033
-那在飞机里面  -怎么了?
-That's inside the plane.  -Yeah?

205
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:39,081
但尸体也在里面  他们都...
But the bodies are in there,and they're all...

206
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,000
交给我吧,你去照看一下...
Look, I'll handle it.Why don't you keep an eye on...

207
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:48,027
好  我很愿意  这就去
Great. Yeah, I'd love to. On it.

208
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:33,027
你在这做什么?
What are you doing in here?

209
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:35,000
找东西  和你一样
Trick-or-treatin', same as you.

210
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:36,047
你这是掠夺
You're looting.

211
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:38,099
随你怎么说
Ahh! You say potato.

212
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:41,006
你包里是什么?
What's in the bag?

213
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:44,003
烟  酒  还有几本"花花公子"
Booze, smokes, a couple "playboys."

214
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:46,005
-你的呢?  -药
-What's in yours?  -Medicine.

215
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,097
我们正好互补  是吧?
Well, just about sums it up, don't it?

216
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,082
你在家也这么做吗?
You do this back home, too?

217
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:53,034
偷死人的东西?
Steal from the dead?

218
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,078
老兄  醒醒吧  感受一下这里充斥的谎言
Brother, you got to wake up and smell the gull crap here.

219
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,092
救援队不会来的
Rescue ain't coming.

220
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:01,087
你是在浪费时间
You're just wasting your time,

221
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:05,010
试着去救一个我上次见到时
trying to save a guy who,last time I checked,

222
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:08,027
有一个像我头一样大的铁片插在肚子上的人
had a piece of metal the size of my head sticking out of his bread basket.

223
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,082
我来问问你
Let me ask you something.

224
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:15,024
你要用多少那样的药片才能救活他?
How many of those pills are you going to use to fix him up?

225
00:14:15,031 --> 00:14:17,007
-需要多少就用多少  -是吗?
-As many as it takes.  -Yeah?

226
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,001
你有多少?
How many you got?

227
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:27,023
你要看看这的情况  医生
You're just not looking at the big picture, doc.

228
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:30,016
你还活在文明社会
You're still back in civilization.

229
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,092
-是吗?  那你在哪?  -我?
-Yeah? And where are you?  -Me?

230
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:36,072
我在野生社会
I'm in the wild.

231
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:53,014
我来吧
I got it.

232
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,025
让我来
I got it.

233
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,059
谢谢
Thanks.

234
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,029
我来  我来  好的
I got it. I got it. Yeah.

235
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,050
我们要看到光明的一面
Well, look on the bright side.

236
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,088
要是别人遇到这事  状况未必比我们好
Whoever's this was is probably better off than we are.

237
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,049
我来
I got it.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
我想我找到你的包了

239
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,000
真的吗?

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
让我看看

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
这不是我的

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,030
那么我继续找找

243
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
你看看你自己

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
你的衣服 你现在很脏

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
马上去洗一洗

246
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Sun

247
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,000
我爱你

248
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:48,061
-孩子怎么样?  -应该没事
-How's the baby?  -It's okay, I think.

249
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:49,068
很好
Good.

250
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,098
那  你的...
So, your,

251
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:56,020
你丈夫不在飞机上?
your husband, was he on the flight?

252
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,002
不  我没结婚呢
no, I'm not married.

253
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,088
我知道  我很前卫
I know. How modern of me.

254
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:06,055
需要男人做什么  对吧?
Well, who needs men, right?

255
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,020
一点用都没有
Bloody useless.

256
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:15,003
你们爬到山顶上  却一无所获?
So, you guys hiked all the way up on that mountain for nothing, huh?

257
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,076
抱歉
Sorry.

258
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:24,068
我要去弄些水
I was gonna get some more water.

259
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:27,008
我们还不认识  我是Kate
We haven't met. I'm Kate.

260
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:31,030
-你好  Kate  -你好
-Hi, Kate.  -Hi.

261
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,012
Hurley

262
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:40,051
我在找Jack  以为他会在这
I was just looking for Jack,and I thought he might be in there.

263
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,032
是的...不
Yeah...no.

264
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,079
他去找药去了
He went to go get some medicine.

265
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,070
-哪  机身里?  -什么?
-Where, in the fuselage?-What?

266
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:54,043
是的  在
Yeah. Yeah, in the,

267
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:58,034
我要弄水去了
You know, I got to go get that water.

268
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,079
如果你把钱存起来
The bank would have given you a heck of a toaster

269
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:54,076
银行会奖你一个烤面包机的
if you'd kept that in a savings account.

270
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,048
我要烤面包机做什么?
What do I need a toaster for?

271
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,096
你把工资藏到罐头瓶里去了  Annie
You're hiding your wages in a tin can, Annie.

272
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:02,003
我是说  我可以替你保管的
I mean, I would have held onto it for you.

273
00:18:03,072 --> 00:18:05,010
我知道怎样安全
I got trust issues.

274
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,098
你不想和我道别吗?
Weren't you gonna say goodbye?

275
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,061
我给你留了张条
I wrote you a note.

276
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:20,010
你来这已经有三个月了  Annie
You've been here for almost three months, Annie,

277
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,032
每次我问你关于你的事,
and every time I ask you about yourself,

278
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,000
你总是那种眼神
you get that look in your eye.

279
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:26,034
对  就是这种
Yeah, that one.

280

所以我就不再问了

281
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:33,057
我想可能你一时糊涂做了什么坏事
I figured maybe you got off on the wrong side of a bad relationship.

282
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,086
也许你逃了出来

我知道你总有一天会走的

He had a hell of a mortgage.

417
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:21,072
你还是那样
You really are one of a kind.

418
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:30,029
如果你不救他  你可以跑掉的
You know, you would have got away if hadn't saved him.

419
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,007
也许你没察觉到  我已经跑掉了
In case you hadn't noticed, I did get away.

420
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,040
在我看来你还没有
You don't look free to me.

421
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:44,047
Kate  我就要死了  对吗?
Kate, I'm gonna die, right?

422
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:53,002
是的
Yeah.

423
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,071
那么...你会做吗?
So...are you gonna do it,

424
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:59,040
还是不会?
or what?

425
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:16,044
逃犯在哪呢?
So, where's the fugitive?

426
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,035
帐篷里
In the tent.

427
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:21,052
你让她自己去那里?
You let her in there alone?

428
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:23,073
她能做什么?
What's she gonna do?

429
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:27,017
-一个120磅的女人  -是的  但她有枪
-She's 120 pounds soaking wet.  -Yeah, but she's got that gun.

430
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:30,004
-什么?  -她带着的
-What?  -She's strapped, man.

431
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:31,062
我看见了  在她的...她的...
I saw it in her...in her...in her

432
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,030
-你做了什么?  -有什么不能做的
-What did you do?  -What you couldn't.

433
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:03,087
作为一名医生  我知道你应该做什么
Look, I get where you're coming from,being a doctor and all.

434
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:06,015
但是他想这样的  是他要我做的
But he wanted it. Hell, he asked me.

435
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:09,025
我不比你更喜欢做这个
So I don't like it any more than you do,

436
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:12,040
但有些事是一定要有人去做的
but something had to be done.

437
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,099
我的天
no way.

438
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:20,043
伙计们
Guys.

439
00:35:28,023 --> 00:35:29,067
你朝他胸部射的?
You shot him in the chest?

440
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,052
我瞄的是他的心脏
I was aiming for his heart.

441
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,033
你没打中
You missed.

442
00:35:32,054 --> 00:35:34,054
他还在呼吸吗?
Is he still breathing ?

443
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:37,099
你射穿了他的肺  要用几小时他才会失血而死
You perforated his lung.It'll take hours to bleed out.

444
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:41,096
可是...只有一颗子弹
There was...only had one bullet.

445
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:44,080
出去!  出去!
Get out. Get out!

446
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:10,066
该死!
Damn it!

447
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,052
我找到了你儿子的狗
I found your son's dog.

448
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:35,021
什么?
What?

449
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:36,033
Vincent?

450
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:38,079
我把它绑在那边的树上了
I tethered him to a tree just over there.

451
00:37:40,063 --> 00:37:43,023
我知道Walt失去了他的母亲
I know that Walt lost his mom.

452
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:46,062
我想应该你把他的狗带给他
I thought that you should be one

453
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,039
多谢
Thanks

454
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,080
我想告诉你我做了什么
I want to tell you what I did.

455
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,040
他为什么要抓我
Why he was after me.

456
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:33,078
我不想知道
I don't wanna know.

457
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:38,041
没关系的  Kate
It doesn't matter, Kate,

458
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:40,037
我们曾经是谁
who we were,

459
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:42,054
在这之前  在飞机失事之前
what we did before this,

460
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:43,053
做过什么事
before the crash

461
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:44,085
都不重要...
it doesn't really...

462
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:53,026
三天前我们都死了
Three days ago, we all died

463
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:58,021
我们应该重新再来
We should all be able to start over.

464
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,005
好吧
Okay.

465
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,038
好吗?
Okay?

466
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:20,060
