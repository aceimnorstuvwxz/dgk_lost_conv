1
00:00:03,052 --> 00:00:04,004
再见  John
Good-bye, john.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,045
你要对他们撒谎
You're gonna have to lie.

3
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:06,072
这是唯一能保护它的办法
It's the only way to protect it.

4
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,052
这只是个岛  John
It's an island, john.

5
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:10,055
没有人需要保护它
No one needs to protect it.

6
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:11,098
这是个奇迹发生的地方
It's a place where miracles happen.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,012
世上根本就没有奇迹
There's no such thing as miracles.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,038
我们得把所有多余的东西
We gotta get every ounce of extra weight

9
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:17,010
扔下去
Off this chopper now!

10
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:19,032
所有没用的东西  都扔下去
Anything that's not bolted down, toss it out!

11
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,032
Sawyer
Sawyer!

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,062
能把一艘航母炸掉
To blow up a bloody aircraft carrier.

13
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,095
这是个收音机
This is a-a radio receiver.

14
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,014
就会远程引爆炸弹
it triggers the bomb remotely.

15
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:30,015
我已经投了一份人身保? Ben
I took out a bit of a-a life insurance policy, ben.

16
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:31,085
你杀了我的女儿
You killed my daughter.

17
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,050
你杀了那船上的所有人
You just killed everybody on that boat.

18
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:37,055
那又怎么?
So?

21
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,022
对不起  先生  不好意思打搅你一下
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you.

22
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,058
请问现在几点了?
But do you have the time, please?

23
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,071
8点50...
Yeah. it's eight fif--

24
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,097
Sayid?
Sayid?

25
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:34,017
你好  Hurley
Hello, hurley.

26
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,046
探访时间已经过了吧  老兄
I think visiting hours are over, dude.

27
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:42,034
我不是来看你的
This isn't a visit.

28
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:44,092
我要你跟我走
I want you to come with me.

29
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:47,027
跟你去哪里?
Come with you where?

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,047
一个安全的地方
Somewhere safe.

31
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:50,059
我干嘛要跟你走啊?
And why would I go anywhere with you?

32
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:53,013
我貌似有N久没有见过你了
I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

33
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:56,004
因为情况有变
Because circumstances have changed.

34
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,035
什么样的情况?
What circumstances?

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,091
Bentham死了
Bentham's dead.

36
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:04,062
什么
What?

37
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,065
两天前死的
Two days ago.

38
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,026
发生什么事了?
What happened?

39
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,004
据说他是自杀
They said it was suicide.

40
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,099
什么叫"据说"他是自杀?
What do you mean, they "said" it was suicide?

41
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:17,010
-还有你干嘛叫他"Bentham"?  他名叫...  -别说出来
- And why are you calling him "bentham"? his name is-- don't say it.

42
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:22,082
我们被监视了
We're being watched.

43
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,095
老兄  我一直在
Dude, I've been having

44
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:28,018
和死人聊着天
Regular conversations with dead people.

45
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,023
我准是有妄想症
The last thing I need now is paranoia.

46
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:33,025
我刚杀了一个从上星期起
I just killed a man who's been perched

47
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:35,077
就守在门外的家伙
Outside this facility for the last week.

48
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,058
我就是全靠妄想症而得以生存至今
I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.

49
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:45,067
我们不是要回去吧?
We're not going back, are we?

50
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,030
不是
No.

51
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,031
只是去个安全的地方
Just somewhere safe.

52
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,078
那好吧
Okay then.

53
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:00,074
等一下
Hold on a sec.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,046
将死  Eko先生
Checkmate, mr. eko.

55
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:24,023
-货船在哪  -我也不知道  我保持着正确航向
- Where's the freighter? -  I don't know.  I stayed on course.

56
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:26,027
他们一定又是把船开走了
They must have it on the move again.

57
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,023
还剩多少油?
How much fuel?

58
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,049
还能坚持4到5分钟
Four, five minutes worth,

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,039
除非还有人想跳下去减轻负荷
Unless somebody else wants to jump.

60
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:45,031
我们一找到船就折回去找他
As soon as we get to the boat, we'll go back for him.

61
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:51,046
船在那儿! 我看到了! 就在我们后面!
There it is! the boat! I see it! behind us!

62
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,018
Ben  帮帮我
Ben, help me.

63
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,021
要是他死了  船上的人就都得玩完了
If he dies, everybody on that boat dies.

64
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:22,003
那可不关我的事  John
That's not my problem, john.

65
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,068
挺住  挺住!
Hang on, man. hang on!

66
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:28,098
不管你逃到天涯海角...
Wherever you go...

67
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,014
Widmore...
Widmore...

68
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:39,039
都会上门来找你算帐的
He'll find you.

69
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:45,097
没准我先找他算帐呢
Not if I find him first.

70
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:51,068
不要啊  不要
Hey. no. no.

71
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:07,099
你们俩现在就走  让所有人都离开船
You two need to go now. get everybody off the boat.

72
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,083
瓶里大概还剩5分钟左右的冷冻气体
We have maybe five minutes left in the tank.

73
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,058
走啊!
Go!

74
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:14,046
你走  快走
You go. go.

75
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,082
我留下来
I stay.

76
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,049
糟糕
Oh, bloody hell.

77
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,021
别着陆!
Don't land!

78
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:05,005
你们不能着陆!  别着陆!
You can't land! don't land!

79
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:10,058
别着陆!
Don't land!

80
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:15,028
要爆炸了!　要爆炸了!
There's a bomb! there's a bomb!

81
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,097
快离开啊! 要爆炸了!
Get away! there's a bomb!

82
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:19,023
-你们不能着陆! 飞回去! -他是不是说"要爆炸了"?
You can't land! go back! did he say "bomb"?

83
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,026
别着陆!
Don't land!

84
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,010
-你在干嘛?!  -我才不管他在嚷嚷什么!
What are you doing?! I don't care what the hell he's screaming!

85
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,059
飞机都冒烟了!  我必须让这铁家伙着陆!
I'm flying on fumes! I gotta put this bird down!

86
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:29,088
不要!  别着陆!
No! don't land!

87
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,089
不!  不!  你不明白!
No! no! look, you don't understand!

88
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,050
Jin和Michael在尽一切力量
Jin and michael are doing everything they can,

89
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:02,077
可是没时间了!
But there's no time!

90
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:04,072
你们现在都给我下船!
You've gotta get off the boat now!

91
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:07,080
我们还要多久才能再次起飞?
How long till we can fly again?

92
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,059
有没有人能补一下这个枪子儿打穿的洞!
Somebody patch the other hole where the bullet came out!

93
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,059

Here! somebody pump some gas! I'll handle the fuel.

00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:35,081
你是Widmore先生吗?

140
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:36,072
是的
Yes.

141
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:39,075
我是Sun Kwon  是Paik的女儿
I'm sun kwon... mr. paik's daughter.

142
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:42,029
我是Paik企业的常务董事
I'm the managing director of paik industries.

143
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,068
是的  我知道  你父亲可好?
Yes, of course. how is your father?

144

145
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,075
他高尔夫球打得很好
Quite the golfer.

146
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:50,089
我记得上次比赛后我还欠他一顿饭
I believe I owe him dinner after our last game.

147
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:55,098
你还真打算假装一直不认识我吗?
Are you really going to pretend that you don't know who I am?

148
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,090
我不明白你的意思  Kwon小姐
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, ms. kwon.

149
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,009
你知道  你当然知道  Widmore先生
Yes, you do know, mr. widmore...

150
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:03,051
正如你知道
Just like you know

151
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:06,010
我们一直在隐瞒我们以前待的地方
We've been lying all this time about where we were

152
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,032
还有我们所遭遇的事
And what happened to us there.

153
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:13,078
你和我有着共同的利益驱使
You and I have common interests.

154
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,053
当你想要和我谈这些的时候
When you're ready to discuss them...

155
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,030
给我打电话
Call me.

156
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:24,057
正如你所知
As you know,

157
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,043
我们不是唯一离开那座岛的人
We're not the only ones who left the island.

158
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:34,012
Kwon小姐
Ms. kwon?

159
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:37,066
你为什么要帮助我?
Why would you want to help me?

160
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,080
飞回去!  我们一定要找到Jin!
Go back lower! we have to go find jin!

161
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:55,074
-Sun  那里已经没有人了!  -你怎么知道!
- Sun, there's nobody down there! - you can't see anything from here!

162
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:58,090
-油不够了!  我们不能回去!  -飞回去!  我知道他在那儿!
- We didn't get enough fuel! - we can't go back! go lower! I know he's there!

163
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:00,086
-Sun  我...Sun  我很抱歉  他已经...  -他在那里!
- Sun, I'm--sun, I'm so sorry. he's not-- - he's down there!

我知道他就在那里!
I know he's down there!

165
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:03,005
-我们得走了!  -不要!  我不要丢下他!
- We gotta go! - no! I'm not leaving him!

166
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:06,067
不能去找他!  不  我们不能丢下他! 
Can't get to him! no, we're not leaving him!

167
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,047
不能!  快调头!
 we're not! turn back around!

168
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,098
Sun!  sun!  他死了!
Sun! sun! it's gone!

169
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,077
他死了
He's gone.

170
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:21,011
嘘  嘘
Shh. shh.

171
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:31,034
Lapidus!
Lapidus!

172
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:33,048
载我们回小岛
Fly us back to the island.

173
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:35,047
收到
You got it.

174
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:38,037

00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:44,032
不!
No!

177
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:47,038
为什么?
Why?

178
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:49,028
什么为什么?
"why" what?

179
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,056
你知道那东西能炸毁船  为什么还要杀死他?
Why did you kill him when you knew it would destroy the boat?

180
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,084
John  我当时真的难以控制我的情绪
Well, john, I really wasn't thinking straight.

181
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,010
有的时候...
Sometimes...

182
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,048
即使英明的决策
Good command decisions get compromised

183
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,061
也会受到不好的情绪所影响
By bad emotional responses.

184
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,072
我相信你能公私分明
I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job

185
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:10,091
比我做得更好
Of separating the two than I ever did.

186
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,006
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

187
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:25,092
-我在问你呢!  -如果我是你  我会躲一下
- I asked you a question! - if I were you, I'd duck.

188
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,017
我最好得改改了
I better change.

189
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,054
游泳的好天气啊
Nice day for a swim.

190
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,070
你还在这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

191
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:24,096
在想要不要去泡一泡
Decided to take a dip.

192
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,020
你在庆祝什么?
Whatcha celebratin'?

193
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,076
我没有在庆祝
I'm not celebrating.

194
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,023
那是我们的船吗?
Is that our boat?

195
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,034
曾经是
It was.

196
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,034
穿那个做什么?
What's that for?

197
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,063
我要去一个冰冷的地方
I'm going somewhere cold.

198
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,004
那我呢?
Then where is mine?

199
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,054
因为你不会和我一起去
Because you're not going with me.

200
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:21,073
-不  我会和你去的  -不会  John  你不会
- Yes, I am going with you.- no, john, you're not.

201
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:23,080
Jacob告诉过我要怎么做
Jacob told me what we had to do.

202
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,010
你不能就这样全权决定了...
You don't get to make all the decisions--

203
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,071
他告诉你要做什么  但没有跟你说怎么做
He told you what to do, but he didn't tell you how

204
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:31,073
-因为他要我来承担后果  -什么后果
- Because he wants me to suffer the consequences. - what consequences?

205
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:41,020
不管是谁移动了这岛就不会再活着出来
Whoever moves the island can never come back.

206
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:46,015
所以你得坐上电梯  John
So I'd like you to get on the elevator, john,

207
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:47,037
上去吧
And go back up.

208
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:48,085
Richard和我的人
Richard and my people will be waiting

209
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:54,008
-在兰花站西边2英里处等着  -等我?
- 2 miles east of the orchid. -  waiting for me?

210
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,027
他们愿意  乐意
Ready, willing and able

211
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:59,010
地告诉你他们所知道的事
To share what they know.

212
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,094
然后他们会对你马首是瞻
And then they will follow your every word.

213
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,015
再见  John
Good-bye, john.

214
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:17,028
很抱歉让你的生活如此痛苦
I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.

215
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,054
我要告诉他们做什么?
What do I tell 'em to do?

216
00:16:35,022 --> 00:16:36,098
你会知道的  John
You'll find your way, john.

217
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,054
你向来如此
You always do.

218
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:18,085
你好  John
Hello, john.

219
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,064
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

220
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:31,095
我想你现在满意了吧  Jacob
I hope you're happy now, jacob.

221
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:46,098
那是什么?
Yeah, what is that?

222
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:59,018
岛去哪了?
Where's the island?

223
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,071
岛呢?
Where's the island?!

224
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:11,002
-他妈的 那岛哪去了?  -消失了  
- Where the hell's the island?! - it's gone.

225
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:20,005
我把这鬼东西停哪儿啊?
Where the hell am I gonna land this thing?!

226
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:23,062
他们把我们带到过附近的另一个小一点的岛
There's another smaller island close by they took us to!

227
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:25,034
医生  我给你说
I got news for ya, doc!

228
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:27,069
四周除了水  什么也没有
There's nothing but water in every direction!

229
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,003
现在没关系了
Doesn't matter now.

230
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,055
我们完了  没油了
That's it, people! we're out of fuel!

231
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:46,084
穿上救生衣  我们要入水了
Get your life vests on! we're going in!

232

Is he breathing? oh, my god. is he breathing?

247
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:39,006

280
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:03,021
前一分钟那岛还在
Cause... one minute it was there,

281
00:29:03,022 --> 00:29:05,021
接着就不见了  那么...
And the next it was gone, so...

282
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:07,097
伙计  除非是我们看花眼了
Unless we, like, overlooked it, dude,

283
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:09,092
这绝对是他做的
That's exactly what he did.

284
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:13,099
但是...如果你有另外的解释  伙计
But... if you've got another explanation, man,

285
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,030
我愿意洗耳恭听
I'd love to hear it.

286
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,084
万能的主啊
God almighty.

287
00:29:27,024 --> 00:29:29,007
那有条船
There's a boat.

288
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:32,076
那有条船
There's a boat out there!

289
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,002
那有条船  你看见了吗?
Hey! there's a boat! you see it?!

290
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:40,075
看呢  就在那
Hey! over here!

291
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:44,026
它看见我们了吗?  我想它看见了
Does it see us? I think it does!

292
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,042
它调头了?
It is turning?

293
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:51,058
它调头了!
It's turning! hey!

294
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:54,030
我们得撒谎
We're gonna have to lie.

295
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,071
什么?
What?

296
00:29:58,081 --> 00:30:00,055
我们得撒谎
We're gonna have to lie.

297
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,038
撒什么谎?
Lie about what?

298
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,099
每一件事情  所有的事情
Everything, all of it,

299
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,045
我们坠机来到这个岛上之后的所有事
Every moment since we crashed on the island.

300
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:14,010
Jack...我虽然是刚刚才和你们一起
Jack... now I know I'm new to this group and everything,

301
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,034
但我觉得此时此地
But isn't this the place where everybody

302
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:18,001
-我们应该欢呼雀跃呀?  -你的货船...
- Starts jumping up and down and hugging each other?  - your freighter...

303
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:21,078
那些人来到岛上杀我们  我们所有人
Those men came to the island to kill us, all of us.

304
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:24,093
你说过我们的飞机被发现了
You said that our plane was discovered

305
00:30:24,094 --> 00:30:25,078
在大洋底下
On the bottom of the ocean.

306
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,069
是有人把它放在那儿的...
Well, someone put it there--

307
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,039
而那个人想让所有的人都认为我们已经死了
Someone who wants everyone to think that we're dead.

308
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,072
那么你们认为当我们告诉世界那架飞机
So what do you think's gonna happen to us

309
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:35,037
不是我们乘坐的那架时会怎么样
When we tell them that that wasn't our plane?

310
00:30:37,077 --> 00:30:38,085
而那些依然留在岛上的人
What do you think's gonna happen

311
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,086
又会怎样?
To the people that we left behind?

312
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,016
Jack  我们不能
Jack, we can't.

313
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:50,073
我们不能就这样全部忘记
We can't pull it off.

314
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,069
让我来说好了
Just let me do the talking.

315
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,082
下面有人!

316
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:41,040
Widmore女士  下面有艘救生筏

317
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:45,089
Widmore女士!
Ms. widmore!

318
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:52,096
把绳子扔给他们!  带他们去船尾!
Throw them a rope! take them 'round to the stern!

319
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,087
Penny?
Penny?

320
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,024
Penny!
Penny!

321
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,074
Penny!
Penny!

322
00:33:00,002 --> 00:33:01,047
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

323
00:33:02,004 --> 00:33:04,004
我...我很好
I'm--i'm fine.

324
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:06,012
我很好
I'm fine.

325
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:10,018
你怎么...怎么知道我的?
H-how did you find me?

326
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:12,037
你的电话...
Your phone call...

327
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,019
我有一个信号追踪站
I have a tracking station.

328
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:22,047
我爱你  Penny...
I love you, penny...

329
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:26,034
我再也不会离开你了
And I'll never leave you again.

330
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,026
这是...这是Penny
This is--this is penny.

331
00:33:43,027 --> 00:33:46,047
-这是Kate和Aaron  -你好

这是Sun
And this is sun,

333
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:53,078
Sayid  Hurley
Sayid, hurley.

334
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,098
你好
Hi.

335
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,097
这是Frank

还有Jack  Jack  这是...这是Penny
And jack. jack, this is--this is penny.

337
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:04,071
-很高兴见到你  Penny...  -你好

338
00:34:06,018 --> 00:34:08,036
不过我们得谈谈
But we need to talk.

339
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:19,076
一周后

Membata
Membata.

343
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:34,091
我们为什么要这样做  伙计?
Why are we doing this, dude?

344
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:38,010
航行3000英里去另一个岛?
Sailing 3,000 miles to another island?

345
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:41,084
因为这是唯一让他们安全的办法
Because it's the only way to keep them safe.

346
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:54,081
-还有多久能靠岸?  -如果风不太猛烈的话...  
- How long till we'll hit land?  - well, if the wind's not too brutal...

347
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:57,038
八九个小时吧
Eight, nine hours.

348
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,081
足够长来给你一个漂亮而且令人信服的晒斑
Just long enough to give you a nice, convincing sunburn.

349
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:04,070
这非常好  Frank

希望我们再也不会相见了

再见  小甜心
Bye, sweetheart.

353
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:28,061
你真的要这么做吗  兄弟?
Are you sure about this, brother?

354
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:31,082
你呢?
Are you sure?

355
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:35,090
只要能和Penny在一起...

356
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:39,032
我就没事
I'll be fine.

357
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:43,033
别让他找到你  Desmond
Don't let him find you, desmond.

358
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,068
我们来生再见吧  兄弟
I'll see you in another life, brother.

359
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:51,082
是的
Aye.

360
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:54,074
我猜你会的
I guess you will.

361
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,049
好吧
All right.

362
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,097
让我们回家吧

00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,059
你好  Jack
Hello, jack.

365
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:31,047
抱歉
Sorry.

366
00:39:31,048 --> 00:39:33,031
不是有意要吓你
Didn't mean to scare you.

367
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,089
他告诉你我离开了那个岛吗?
Did he tell you that I was off the island?

368
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:43,085
是的  告诉了
Yes, he did.

369
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,001
你什么时候跟他谈的话?

370
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,037
大概一个月前
About a month ago.

371
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:57,090
Kate呢?

是的  他也来见她了

374
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:06,075
那他跟你说了些什么?
And what did he say to you?

375
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,054
他告诉我...
He told me...

376
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:13,001
我离开了那个岛之后

377
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,059
有些非常糟糕的事情发生了

378
00:40:19,096 --> 00:40:23,014
他还告诉我那是我的错
And he told me that it was my fault

379
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:25,010
因为我的离去
For leaving.

380
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:30,054
他还说我得回去
And he said that I had to come back.

381
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,018
是的  我听说你经常搭乘客机...
Yes, I heard that you've been flying on passenger planes...

382
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:39,002
希望你会坠机
Hoping that you'd crash.

383
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:44,008
非常阴暗  Jack  非常阴暗
It's dark, jack, very dark.

384
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:46,056
你为什么在这儿?
Why are you here?

385
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:52,011
那个岛不会让你一个人回去的
That the island won't let you come alone.

386
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:02,029
你们所有的人都得回去

387
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,003
你...
Are you...

00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:10,016
Sayid...我都不知道Sayid在哪

389
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:11,056
Hurley...
Hurley...

390
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:13,097
发疯了

391
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:16,084
Sun责怪我  因为...
Sun blames me for...

392
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:20,068
还有Kate...
And then kate...

393
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:26,020
她甚至都不再跟我说话了
She won't even talk to me anymore.

394
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:28,077
也许我能帮你
Perhaps I can help you with that.

395
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:34,001
你们必须得一起回去  Jack
This is the way it has to be, jack.

396
00:41:34,002 --> 00:41:36,007
这是唯一的办法
It's the only way.

397
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:40,065
你们得一起  所有人
You have to do it together, all of you.

398
00:41:41,064 --> 00:41:43,029
怎么做?
How?

00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,079
我有些想法
I have a few ideas.

400
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:02,096
Jack...
Jack...

401
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:05,030
我说过  你们所有人
I said, all of you.

402
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:09,003
我们还得把他也带上
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

403
