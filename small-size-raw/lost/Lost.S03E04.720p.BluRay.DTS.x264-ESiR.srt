Previously on Lost

00:00:03,096 --> 00:00:05,023
你想做什么?
- What do you want from me ?

3
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,050
耐心点  Jack  耐心
- Patience, Jack. Patience.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,015
- Danny  等等 - 呆在这
- Danny, wait.  - Hold up.

5
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,074
去那要小心
Be careful out there.

6
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:18,015
- 看见这些石头了吗? - 你来把它们挖松
See these rocks here? You're gonna chop 'em loose,

7
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:20,021
你就负责把它们拉走
and you're gonna haul 'em outta here.

8
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:26,072
我不是你们的敌人
I am not the enemy.

9
00:00:26,072 --> 00:00:28,078
我们都不是敌人
We are not the enemy.

10
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:30,046
但如果你开枪了
If you shoot me...

11
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:32,087
那我们就肯定是敌人了
that's exactly what we'll become.

12
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,051
你的...
You've...

13
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,008
你的顶棚有问题
You've got a problem with your roof.

14
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,001
什么?
What ?

15
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:22,000
也许你今晚可以在海滩上过夜
Maybe you should move on the beach, just for the night.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,014
这样我就可以修一下顶棚了  做一些改进
 Then I can fix it and, make some improvments.

17
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,092
非常感谢你的提议
That is really nice of you to offer but,

18
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:28,053
但是...Aaron刚刚睡着
Aaron just fell asleep,

19
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:29,053
所以我可能只有...
so I should probably just...

20
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:32,041
这么做很有必要  相信我
I'll deal with it. I promise.

21
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,099
你在干什么  伙计?
What are you doing, brother ?

22
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,020
我想帮她修理下顶棚
I was just offering to fix this roof here.

23
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:41,060
顶棚?  好吧
Roof ? Fine.

24
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,031
如果有问题的话我来修好了
If there a problem, i'll fix it.

25
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:45,001
我比较擅长
I'm quite handy.

26
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,073
在Eko被炸飞前我还在造教堂呢
I was building a church before...Eko explode it.

27
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:54,074
好吧  那么...
Right, well...

28
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,083
我只是想帮帮你
Just trying to help.

29
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,000
谢谢
Thanks.

30
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,026
到底是怎么回事?
What was all that about ?

31
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:06,007
不知道
I don't know.

32
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:09,004
也许我们得另找一个按键让他按
We gonna have together another button push.

33
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,085
今天过得怎样  Jack?
How are you doing today, Jack ?

34
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:43,046
好极了
Great.

35
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,086
你看起来很沮丧
You seem frustrated.

36
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:49,016
我是继续看卡通呢
to keep watching cartoons, or...

37
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,059
还是你告诉我为什么我会在这?
are you gonna tell me why I'm here.

38
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,043
我希望你喜欢蓝莓  不喜欢的话我...
I hope you like blueberry. - If not I can...

39
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:56,012
- 我可以和Benjamin谈谈吗? - 什么?
-Should I talk to Benjamin ?

40
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:59,017
我可以和Benjamin谈谈吗? 因为我在想...
- Should i talk to Benjamin ? Because I'm sorry

41
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:01,059
你只是个给我送饭的
to think that you're just the person who brings me my food.

42
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,095
你愿意的话你可以和他谈谈
You can talk to him all you want,

43
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,081
但他不会告诉你任何东西
but he won't tell you anything.

44
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:10,032
- 你在帮他干活 - 不  我没在为他工作
- You work for him. - No, I don't work for him.

45
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:11,024
他是头儿
He's in charge.

46
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,014
我们不搞这一套  Jack
It doesn't work that way over here, Jack

47
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:16,007
- 我们一起做决定 - 真的吗?
We make decisions together. Really?

48
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:19,094
当我拿着那只破碗指着你脖子的时候
Because when I was holding that broken plate at your neck,

49
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:22,096
他看起来对你的死活根本无所谓
he seemed happy to just let you die.

50
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,044
我是说  这好像...
I mean, it felt like

51
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:27,007
他自己一个人做了一个决定
he made that decision on his own.

52
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,092
你不知道你自己在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

53
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,094
我没有服从他的决定
I don't answer to him.

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,008
Juliet  我需要你帮忙
Juliet, I need you.

55
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:38,023
等一下好吗?
Can it wait?

56
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:42,072
那家伙回来了  情况不太好
The sub is back. We have a situation,

57
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,079
马上和我来
so come with me now.

58
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,098
开始干活了
Time for work.

59
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:14,097
感觉有点无聊么  唐人街来的小子
Soundin' a little stuffy there, Chinatown.

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,067
想让鼻子开花吗?
Need to blow your nose?

61
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,086
- 给我个理由 - 我想我已经说过了
- Just give me an excuse. - Thought I just did.

62
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:22,016
我该做什么  问候你老妈?
What I gotta do, talk about your mother?

63
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:24,028
Danny  你在吗?
Danny, are you there?

64
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:26,008
是的
Yeah.

65
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,085
等等
Hold on.

66
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:30,092
好了  快走
Okay, go

67
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,036
什么?
What?

68
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:35,059
他们在哪?
- Where are they?

69
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,056
他们在...
- They're back in the...

70
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,078
都是你的错  Juliet
This is bad, Juliet.

71
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,004
抬稳点
Keep her steady.

72
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:54,056
她会好的  是吗?  她会没事吗?
She'll be okay?

73
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,042
发生了什么?
What happened?

74
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:03,033
我们的人干的
We happened.

75
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,000
什么?
What?

76
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,074
我在这里这么久早知道
I've been on this rock long enough to realize

77
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:09,030
他们这伙人是不会自相残杀的
they ain't in the business of shootin' each other.

78
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:12,094
是我们干的
We did it.

79
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,030
我们的人
Our team.

80
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:17,050
你在笑?
You smiling?

81
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:20,042
混蛋  好吧  我是在笑
Damn right I'm smiling.

82
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:24,082
因为我们可以开溜了
'Cause we just got our ticket outta here.

你知道那个担架上的女人吗?
You know that chick they brought in on a stretcher?

93
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,048
是那个鼻子破了的家伙的女朋友
That's broken nose man's girl.

94
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:22,003
他们叫他放哨的
They call him Pickett.

95
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:25,043
那么那个放哨的分散了他们的注意力
Well, Pickett is distracted at the moment.

96
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,007
所以呢?
So?

97
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,094

有条输送管在给这台机器输送果汁
There's juice pumpin' into this box from somewhere.

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,068
下次有人来拉我出去的话
Next time someone comes to pull me out,

102
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:45,035
我会等他踩进我的小泳池里
I'm gonna wait till they step in my little swimming hole,

103
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:47,055
然后抓住他们  滋的一声
then I grab 'em. Zap.

104
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:50,066
他们触电倒地后  我就可以拿到钥匙了
They fall back from the shock, I snag the keys.

105
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:54,028
我打赌熊是想不出这个主意的
Bet the bears never thought of that.

106
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:55,093
你们都会触电的
You're both gonna get electrocuted.

107
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:58,052
是的  但我被电过一次 我承受的了
Yeah, but I felt the jolt. I can take it.

108
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:01,035
另一个呢...他不会有准备的
The other guy, he ain't gonna be ready for it.

109
00:07:03,063 --> 00:07:05,021
怎么  你认为我疯了?
What, you think I'm crazy?

110
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,031
不  事实上我很感兴趣
No, I'm actually impressed.

111
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:11,076
把你眼里的星光擦去吧  亲爱的
Well, wipe the stars out of your eyes, sweetheart

112
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,058
因为我们必须这么做
'cause we're gonna do this

113
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:17,074
那Jack怎么办?
What about him?

114
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:19,052
关他什么事?
What about him?

115
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,087
我们不知道他是否在这
We don't even know if he's here.

116
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,027
甚至还不知道他是否活着
Hell, we don't even know if he's alive.

117
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,090
我们得照顾好我们自己
We gotta take care of us.

118
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:32,031
每个人都会有私心的  小妞
It's every man for himself, Freckles.

119
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,051
好了  Ford  够了
All right, Ford, that's enough.

120
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:47,037
所有人返回牢房
All inmates are required

121
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:49,008
立即执行...
to report to your cells for mandatory...

122
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:52,041
问题是我只在意你的手 而不是你的眼神
Problem is, I was following your hands, no your eyes.

123
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,017
问题是你又老又不说话
Problem is, you old and dumb.

124
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,007
你藏在那里了?
Where did you hide it?!

125
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:01,010
那个被打的是谁?
Who's the punching bag?

126
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:05,018
刚来  叫Munson
Just got here. Name is Munson.

127
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,032
听说他窃了政府一千万
Rumor has it he ripped off the government for 10 mil,

128
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,027
但政府却找不到这笔钱
but they never found the money.

129
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:12,042
- 真该死 - 说话啊  小子
I'll be damned.

130
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,048
如果你的监狱长朋友不制止的话
If your buddy the warden didn't keep breaking up the fights,

131
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:16,035
Munson马上就会变死人了
Munson would be a dead man.

132
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:24,072
那个狗娘养的
That son of a bitch.

133
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:34,001
你晚上在枕头上放薄荷了吗?
You get little mints on your pillow at night, too?

134
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:35,044
什么?
- Sorry?

135
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:38,050
你才这里都一周了就开始做手提包了?
- You been here, what, a week, and you're on tote bag duty?

136
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,025
我来了九个月了  还在倒垃圾
I've been here nine months. I'm still pushing trash.

137
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:43,088
什么意思?
Well, what does that mean?

138
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:46,051
你以为监狱长制止你们打架...
You think the warden's breakin' up those fights

139
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:48,062
是因为你很帅吗  伙计?
'cause you're cute, Costanza?

140
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:52,030
他是为了那一千万在演戏
He's makin' a play for that 10 mil.

141
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:56,028
首先  给你点好处
First step, butter you up.

142
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,039
给你个好工作
Give you a plum job.

143
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:02,065
然后  监狱长就会向你妻子动手
Step two, the warden will reach out to your wife,

144
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,056
让她和你作对
use her against you.

145
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:06,047
巧妙的计划
Textbook con.

146
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,091
那么你友善的告诉我这些
And you're telling me

147
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:10,064
是因为你想...
this out of the kindness

148
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,093
这建议是免费的  伙计
- The advice is free, Murgatroyd.

149
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:16,047
过去的九个月   那个监狱长让我生活生不如死
Past nine months, that warden's made my life a living hell.

150
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:19,040
他拿了好处  而你却什么也没有
He gets that 10 mil you ain't got,

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,096
我真想杀了自己
I just might have to kill myself.

152
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,088
您好  狱长
Well, howdy, warden.

153
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:35,067
他妨碍你了吗  Munson?
He bothering you, Munson?

154
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,094
什么风把你吹到裁缝店来了  老板?
So what brings you　to the sewing shop, Boss?

155
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:47,006
别以为我无权给你加刑  Ford
Don't think　I an't extend your stay, Ford.

156
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:50,000
只要一个电话就够了
All it takes is one call.

157
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,096
一个电话
One call.

158
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:03,025
把那个垃圾捡起来好吗?
How about you get that trash?

159
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:26,066
魔王出现了
oh, yeah. It's the big Kahuna.

160
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,070
吃过午饭了吗?
- Lunch already?

161
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,082
- 你体重多少? - 什么?
- What do you weigh?　- What?

162
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:40,013
你体重多少?
- What do you weigh?

163
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:44,013
180左右
180, give or take.

164
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,053
你几岁了?
- 32.

165
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,024
 别骗我
- don't lie.

166
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,068
很好
Good.

167
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,003
再见吧你
Sayonara, sucke

168
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,010
你干了什么?
What did you do?

169
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,046
我们把它关了
We turned it off.

170
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:21,000
Sawyer

171
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:47,059
在天空变紫色后的两天里...
...two days since the sky turned purple,

172
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,092
我们瞎了  伙伴们都倒下了
we've been blind, our coms are all down

173
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,040
我没办法再支撑了
and I can't get 'em back up again,

174
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,055
为了避免你忘记Colleen的伤痕...
and in case you forgot,  - Colleen's in critical...

175
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:55,093
Juliet在照看她
- Juliet's taking care of her.

176
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,025
我在哪?
Where am I?

177
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:07,080
你们想干什么?
What the hell are you doin' to me?

178
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,050
放开我
Let me out!

179
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,062
Jason  放我出去
Jason. Let me out !

180
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,014
拜托咬紧它
Bite down on this, please.

181
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,000
你咬吧
You bite down on it.

182
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:18,075
会很痛的
It's for the pain.

183
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,096
什么?
What?!

184
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:24,095
等等
Wait!

185
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,084
放开我
Let me out now!

186
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:30,008
- 我讨厌针 - 不  不
I hate needles.

187
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,099
不  你们在干吗?
No! What are you doing?

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,098
你们干什么?
Hey! What are you doing?

189
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,056
不

190
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,079
你们到底在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?!

191
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,018
不对  你得穿透胸骨  是胸骨
No, you have to go through the sternum. Th sternum.

192
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,063
- 不 - 就像电影里的一样
- Like in the movies.

193
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:48,004
- 我知道 - 什么?
- I know, I know.

194
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,034
不  不

195
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,047
- 一... - 你干什么?
- One...- What are you doing?!

196
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,087
二...
Two...

197
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,065
等等
Wait!

198
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:10,060
顾自己玩吧  兄弟  我来拿根球杆
Don't mind me, brother. I'm just gonna take one of your clubs.

199
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:13,019
Hurley说没问题的
Hurley said it'd be all right.

200
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,003
Hurley  是吗?
Hurley, huh?

201
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:17,028
就是说你们又要去拯救大家了
Must mean you're off to save the day.

202
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:21,024
那么...我能拿一个吗?
So... I can take one of these?

203
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:23,002
拿5号杆吧
Take the 5-iron.

204
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,043
我从来不用
I never use it.

205
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:25,096
这样  当你们做你们的事
That way, when you die in the jungle

206
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,096
死在丛林里后
doing whatever you're doing,

207
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,030
我就不用去找它了
I don't have to go looking for it.

208
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,083
谢谢  伙计
Thanks, mate.

209
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,004
你知道  你应该...
You know, you might want

210
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,021
肩膀甩的范围更大些
to square your shoulders a bit more.

211
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:43,010
你会打高尔夫?
- You play golf?

212
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,072
我是苏格兰人  玩得开心
- I'm scottish.

213
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,042
这是什么?
What the hell?

214
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:25,018
快点
Hey, come on.

215
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:29,089
摇动吧  快点  快点  快点 
Hey, move. Let's move. Hey, come on, come on, come on!

216
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,075
- 你在干什么? - 快点  快点  快  快
- What are you doing? - Come on. Come on,

217
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,066
开始吧  开始吧 开始吧  跳舞吧
Let's move it, let's move it.

218
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,022
- 开始吧  快 - 你在干嘛?

219
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,024
- 动起来  动起来  动起来 - 你有毛病?
What's your problem?

220
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:39,034
快  快  快  快

221
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,007
你弄死了它?
Did you just kill that bunny?

222
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,085
你知道起搏器吗?
You know what a pacemaker is?

223
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:01,050
- 什么? - 他们把起搏器放在...
What? They stick 'em in the tickers

224
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,047
做过搭桥手术的人的心脏里
of people who've had bypass work,

225
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:07,077
他们的心脏需要驱动力
a little jump, a kick start.

226
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,043
那只兔子就装了个小起搏器
The rabbit had a small pacemaker

227
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,080
它会在这些时候产生驱动力 像是太兴奋...
set to deliver its kick start, should it get too excited...

228
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,079
或是太焦虑...或是害怕...
or anxious or frightened...

229
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:20,004
或是企图逃走
or should it try to escape.

230
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,048
假如你对于你的年龄和体重
Assuming that you were telling the truth

231
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:28,092
没有说谎的话
about your age and weight,

232
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,082
你静止时的心率
your resting heart rate

233
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:33,006
应该在每分钟70下
should be about 70 beats per minute.

234
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:35,043
然而你活动时的心率
Your active heart rate, however,

235
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:39,008
可能会在140
that would be about 140.

236
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,026
超过这个数字  你的起搏器...
Which is the point at which your pacemaker...

237
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:48,024
就会弄爆你的心脏
will cause your heart to explode.

238
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:57,021
这样我就可以确信你会乖乖的了
Which is how I know that you're gonna start behaving now.

239
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,099
这只表可以监控你的脉搏
The watch monitors your pulse.

240
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:10,020
如果心跳接近危险区域15下以内的话
If you get within 15 beats of your danger zone,

241
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,096
它会响  一旦它响了
it'll start to beep. If and when it beeps,

242
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:16,003
你就得让自己冷静
you're gonna want to relax yourself.

243
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:21,052
做做深呼吸  瑜伽什么的
Do some deep breathing, some yoga.

244
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,006
如果你想我死
If you want me dead,

245
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,087
为什么不一枪了结了我?
why don't you just shoot me and get it over with?

246
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:32,006
因为我们不是杀手  James
Because we're not killers, James.

247
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:38,045
还有件事  Kate
Oh, and one other thing. - Kate.

248
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:40,061
你碰她的话  我发誓... - 如果你告诉她我们做了什么...
You touch her, I swear...

249
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:42,053
我们把什么植入你体内   我们在监控你们
what we put in you, that we're watching you,

250
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:44,090
你告诉她这些的话
you tell her any of these things,

251
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:47,043
我们也会给她装上一个的
we'll put one in her, too.

252
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:03,097
Sawyer?

253
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,016
Sawyer  你没事吧?
Sawyer, are you okay?

254
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:19,005
给你们擦身子用的
That's so you can clean yourselves up.

255
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,058
Kate  如果有不合身的话
And, Kate, if any of that doesn't fit,

256
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:23,084
叫我一声就好了  好吗?
you just give me a holler, okay?

257
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,024
发生了什么?
What happened?

258
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:37,049
他们做了什么?
What did they do to you?

259
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:41,040
没什么  就问了些问题
Nothing. They just asked me questions.

260
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,037
没什么大不了的
Ain't important.

261
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,034
告诉我  发生了什么?
Talk to me. What happened?

262
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,084
听着  我告诉过你  没事
Look, I told you, nothing happened.

263
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,099
别再问了
So quit asking me.

264
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,004
转过去
Turn around.

265
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,063
那是什么?
What's that?

266
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:45,060
我的手表  坏了的
Just my watch. It's busted.

267
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,016
- 你哪来的表? - 我不用每件事都向你汇报吧
- When did you get a watch? - Look, I don't tell you everything!

268
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:52,002
让我安静会儿  该死的
Just leave me alone, damn it.

269
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:55,086
穿上衣服
Put some clothes on.

270
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,072
你好  Sawyer.
Hello, Sawyer.

271
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,063
我叫James Ford  我想你知道的
It's James Ford, and I know you know that,

272
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:43,013
你告我的时候就用的这个名字
cause you got it right when you pressed charges.

273
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:45,021
你生我的气?
You're mad at me?

274
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,016
看看我的处境
Well, look where I am.

275
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,065
你想我怎么样?  你骗了我
What did you want me to do? You conned me.

276
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:51,045
你想要什么?
Something you want?

277
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:56,005
是的是的  是有东西
Yeah. Yeah. There is.

278
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,054
快点  我有执照的
Come on. I got license plates to make.

279
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:20,030
她是谁?
What's this?

280
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,051
是你女儿
This is your daughter.

281
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,004
你想怎么样?
What do you want?

282
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,031
首先我想让你知道这个
Well, first I wanted you to know.

283
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,096
然后呢?  你想我一看这张照片
Then what? Think I'm gonna take　one look at this picture

284
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:35,016
就去参加"老爸最好"这个节目吗?
and turn into "father knows best"?

285
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,051
我们住在新墨西哥州的这个小地方
We're living in this little place　in Albuquerque.

286
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,067
- 在一所大学附近... - 你和我说这些干嘛?
It's near the university.　- Why are you telling me this?

287
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:43,038
我只是...想让你给她写封信
-  just...　thought you could write her a letter.

288
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,003
她叫Clementine
Her name's Clementine.

289
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,018
我该死的可以写点什么?
What the hell am I gonna write?

290
00:20:46,018 --> 00:20:48,045
"亲爱的变形金刚"? 她还是个孩子
"Dear goo-goo ga-ga"?

291
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:50,054
她不是我的
She's a baby. She ain't mine.

292
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:52,033
Sawyer  她...
Sawyer, she...

293
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,016
我没有女儿
I ain't got no daughter.

294
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:15,042
我查看过我的笼子了
I've been checking out my cage,

295
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:18,075
我想如果我爬上去的话
and I think if I climb to the top,

296
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:20,039
我可以从缝隙里挤出去
I can squeeze through those bars.

297
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,067
他们离这里很远
They're spaced farther apart up there.

298
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,019
别找事了
Don't bother.

299
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,084
你在说什么?
- What are you talking about?

300
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,095
我说放聪明点
- I'm talking about being smart.

301
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:31,001
我想我们还是乖乖呆着
I think we should just chill out here a while,

302
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,005
听天由命吧
get the lay of the land.

303
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,088
...在控制下了
...under control.

304
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,078
是吗?  你知道他怎么对Karl吗?
Yeah?　You know what he's doing to Karl?

305
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:44,013
你知道他怎么做吗?
You know what he's doing?

306
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:46,067
把他们两个带来是个错误

307
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:51,094
- 你们对Sawyer怎么了? - 没什么
- What did you do to Sawyer?　- Nothing.

308
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:53,010
- 我听到他在喊 - Jack
I heard him yelling,

309
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,029
- 你衣服上有血 - Jack
yo've got blood on your clothes.

310
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,052
- 你们对他怎么了? - 这不是他的血
What did you do to him?!　- It's not his blood.

311
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,015
那是谁的?
Then whose blood is it?

312
00:22:01,026 --> 00:22:03,078
是一个快死了的女人的血
It's the bldod of a woman who's dying.

313
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:09,091
Jack  我...

314
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:11,065
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

315
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:26,090
是Jack
it's Jack!

316
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,017
- Jack - 医生

317
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:31,038
Jack  Jack

318
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,042
- Jack - 医生

319
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:40,085
Jack

320
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:47,098
你疯了吗?  把他带来这里?
Have you lost your mind? - You bring him here?

321
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,019
他是个医生  他能帮上忙
- He's a doctor. He can help.

322
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:50,004
这不是理由...
- Well, this is not why...

323
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:52,093
你想她死吗?  来吧
- o you want her to die? Come on.

324
00:22:58,058 --> 00:22:59,031
发生了什么?
- What happened?

325
00:22:59,031 --> 00:23:01,091
腹部中枪
- Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

326
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,022
那些不是她的
Those aren't hers.

327
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,088
来吧
Come on.

328
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,045
- 他来干什么? - Danny  他是来帮忙的
- What's he doing in here? - Danny, he's here to help.

329
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:20,021
- 告诉他是谁干的  他应该知道 - Danny...
Tell him who did this. He ought to know that.

330
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:22,073
- 我要他离开这里 - Danny  出去  快
- I need him out of here. - anny, get out. Go.

331
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:24,021
- 拜托 - 不行  不行  她是我的妻子
- No way! She's my  wife!

332
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:26,019
Danny  他们会处理的
- Danny, they got it.

333
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:30,001
我把子弹取出了  但她还在流血
I got the bullet out, but she's still bleeding.

334
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:34,002
右上方在大出血
Right upper quadrant. Its flowing badly.

335
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:36,008
- 不不  我已经填上了 - 我要你夹住肝脏
- No, no, I padded it. - I need you to clamp under the liver

336
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:38,027
这样我就能看看背面了
so I can get a look back there.

337
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:43,051
我...我不是外科医生
I'm not a surgeon.

338
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,008
我知道  但我需要你这么做
I know, but I need you to do this.

339
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,029
这里
Here.

340
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:54,030
她腔静脉在出血
She's got a retrohepatic caval bleed.

341
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,088
在肝脏后面  难怪你没发现
It's, uh, behind the liver. That's why you missed it.

342
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:59,056
我要棉塞  越多越好
I need lap pads, as many as you've got.

343
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,004
好的  再来一个
All right. Another one.

344
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,039
电击器
A crash cart. Now.

345
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:16,020
- Juliet  我需要电击器 - 坏掉了
- Juliet, I need paddles. - It's broken.

346
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,003
我们没有...
We haven't had,

347
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:21,071
Jack  我们以前没遇到过这种事
Jack, we haven't had anything happen before.

348
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:26,039
我们没有...我们... 我没有...我没有...
We didn't-we- I don't...

349
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:43,059
一  二

350
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:46,042
三  四  五  六...

351
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:06,063
时间快...
Time of death is...

352
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:11,080
她死了
She's gone

353
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:19,072
他们干的  他们干的好事

354
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:23,057
Danny  等等  Danny  等等  等等

355
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:42,078
冷静点
Take it easy.

356
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:45,006
冷静点
Take it easy!

357
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:48,050
- 别冲动 - 闭嘴
- Shut up!

358
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:52,049
你爱他吗?
You love this guy?

359
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:54,073
什么?
What?

360
00:25:54,073 --> 00:25:57,065
- 我说  你爱他吗? - 住手
- I said, do you love him? - Stop!

361
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:00,061
你爱他吗?

362
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:04,042
- 你爱他吗? - 放开他
- Do you love him?! - Leave him alone!

363
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:06,036
你爱他吗?
- Do you love him?!

364
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:08,052
你干什么?  住手
- what are you doing? Stop!

365
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:12,086
你...爱...他...吗?
Do... you... love... him?

366
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:16,058
是的  是的  我爱他  我爱他
Yes, I love him! I love him.

367
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,012
我爱他  求你了
I love him. Please.

368
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,098
把他锁起来
Lock him up!

369
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:46,059
我要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

370
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:49,055
- 抱歉  我很忙 - 这很重要

371
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:52,076
拜托
Please.

372
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:57,074
你是对的  我爱她
You were right. I loved her.

373
00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:59,082
我认为...我真的以为她...
And I thought... I really thought she...

374
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:02,026
一千万  很多绿钞啊  伙计
10 mil's a lot of greenbacks, killer.

375
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:04,022
可以改变一切
Tends to change things.

376
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:08,000
这就是为什么她没联系过你
That's why you never get attached,

377
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,091
因为你一旦你在意了
'cause once you care,

378
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:12,020
就是你被抓的时候了
that's when they can come at you.

379
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:14,081
那你的那位想要什么?
Well, what did yours want?

380
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,050
我看见...那天我看见你和...
I saw you the other day with...

381
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,002
一个女人一起  她想要什么?
with a woman. What did she want?

382
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:23,009
我没有的东西
Somethin' I ain't got.

383
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,071
就这样吧  你自己哭一场吧
That all? You had yourself a good cry.

384
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:29,064
介意我回去看看George得到他的农场了吗?
Mind if I go back and see if George gets his farm?

385
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:34,097
我要你转移掉...把钱转移掉
I need you to move it... the money.

386
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:37,023
你没偷的那笔钱?
The money you didn't steal?

387
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:39,084
你我都知道我偷了
We both know I did.

388
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:42,061
Lila请了个私家侦探 找到是迟早的事
Lila's hired a P.I. She's gonna find it.

389
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,098
就算帮帮我  你必须这么做
Do this for me. You have to.

390
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:47,087
不

391
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:50,071
太危险了  我不做活靶子
It's too dangerous. I'll be a walking target.

392
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:53,009
如果你不帮我   监狱长就会得到所有的钱
If you don't help me, the Warden'll get it all.

393
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,086
他会是赢家
He'll win.

394
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:58,063
求你了  求你了
Please.

395
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:09,005
你还好吧?
Are you okay?

396
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:11,051
很好

397
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:13,078
那家伙打起来就像女人
Guy hits like a girl.

398
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:15,079
一点攻击性都没有
No offense.

399
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:18,085
他为什么那么干?
Why did he do that?

400
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,071
我怎么知道
Hell if I know.

401
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:23,043
这些人什么时候告诉过我们为什么?
These people ever make any sense to you?

402
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:27,042
你干什么?
What are you doing?

403
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:29,012
你干什么?
- What are you doing?

404
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,096
看不出来吗?
- what does it look like?

405
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:37,065
等一下  小妞
Hang on a second,  freckles.

406
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:45,072
我告诉过你  这不是时候
I told you the time ain't right.

407
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,051
我们得逃走  这也是你说的
You're the one that said we had to go.

408
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:51,002
- 那是以前... - 在什么以前?
- Well, that was before... - Before what?

409
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:54,028
我不知道他们对你做了什么
I don't know what they did to you,

410
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:56,052
但是我知道你害怕得不敢讲实话了
but I know you're scared enough to lie about it,

411
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,093
那比任何他们的所作所为
and that scares me more than anything

412
00:28:57,093 --> 00:29:01,075
- 都让我感到害怕 - 等等
that they have done to us before.

413
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:05,010
等等
Wait.

414
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:16,061
- 你在干什么? - 把你弄出来
- What are you doing? - Getting you out of here.

415
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:18,092
- 不要 - 我不会撇下你的  Sawyer
- Don't. - I'm not leaving you, Sawyer.

416
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:21,061
- 我可以打开它 - 你已经出来了  你得走了
- I can get it open. - You're already out. You gotta go.

417
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:24,095
- 别管我了 - 什么?
You gotta leave me! - What?

418
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:28,007
- 快跑 - 他们对你怎么了?
- What did they do to you?

419
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:30,007
你快走
- You go!

420
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:32,053
那是什么?
What is that thing?

421
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:36,067
快走  每个人都有私心...
- It's every man for himself.

422
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,067
你为什么不回击?
- Why didn't you fight back?!

423
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:42,081
快跟我讲实话 哪怕你这辈子就说这么一次
Tell me the truth for once in your life!

424

Damnit, Frackles, don't ! Every man for itself !

要我把Shephard带回来吗?
Should I bring Shephard back?

436
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:19,061
不

437
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:24,040
我要让他再陪她坐一会儿
I want him to sit with her for a while longer.

438
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,071
我很抱歉  他们...他们得...
I'm sorry that they...

439
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:44,008
铐住你

Col  Colleen的简称
Col. Short for Colleen.

445

我不应该...
I shouldn't-have,

446
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:13,076
我该早点来找你的
I should've come to get you sooner.

447
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,072
那也不会改变什么
It wouldn't have mattered.

448
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:17,039
你已经尽力了
There wasn't any more that you could have done.

449
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,013
她...在你把她放上手术台前
She was... She was dead

450
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:22,035
就已经没救了
before you put her on the table.

451
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:28,047
你这么说是为了让我好过点吗?
Are you... are you just saying that to make me feel better?

453
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:40,058
我可不管你好不好过
I don't care about making you feel better.

454
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:49,039
我现在要把你带回去  我...

455
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:54,017
很抱歉把你带来这里

所以告诉我  Juliet

463
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,099
我来这里是为了救谁?
who am I here to save?

464
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,059
那是...
Is that...

不  只是一个实验

467
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,008
好的

468

谢谢  我不饿

470
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:19,043
你最好再等一会儿
You might want to wait a minute.

471
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,070
为什么?
Why's that?

472
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:11,024
早上好
Good morning.

473
00:35:13,038 --> 00:35:15,024
我们去散散步吧
Let's go for a walk.

474
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:45,062
我得承认  Ford
I have to be honest, Ford.

475
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:48,022
当他们刚把你带来时
When they first brought you here,

476
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:51,013
我以为你只是个哑吧土鳖
I thought you were nothing more than a dumb hick.

477
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:52,095
现在我了解你了

478
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:56,089
你是个知道怎么偷东西的哑吧土鳖
You're a dumb hick that knows how to steal.

480
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:04,085
好吧
Yeah, let's.

你还记得财政部的特工Freeman吗?

482
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,088
那么  该你说了吧?
So, what do you got?

483
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:20,065
那一千万美元在一辆野马车里
The $10 million's in a red Bronco parked

484
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:22,006
车停在411公路旁23-C号

486
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,072
的一个便利店旁
Unit 23-C.

487
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:34,052
你的钱就在那
That's where your money is.

488
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:38,049
我们说好的
As agreed,

489
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:41,021
一旦那辆车找到了
the last six years of your sentence

490
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:43,004
钱也被追回了

491
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:45,028
你后面六年的刑期
As soon as the truck is recovered

492
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:46,032
将会被减免
and the funds confirmed,

493

我想开一个新帐户  随便什么银行

只要在新墨西哥州就可以了
Just make it in Albuquerque.

497
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,091

498

用Clementine Phillips这个名字开户

好的  Clementine Phillips

500
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:09,072
我这么做是因为
And I want it so there's no way

501
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:12,063
她永远也不会知道钱是哪里来的了

502
00:37:13,076 --> 00:37:16,000

503
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,025

你连哄带骗的离开了监狱

506

你自由了

507
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,097
不远了  James

508
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:54,012
下个山峰的顶端就是了
Just to the top of the next rise.

509

510
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:02,063
我想让你看的东西

什么?
What

513
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:12,060
怎么  你不看书吗?
don't you read?

514
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:15,009
是<人鼠之间>里的
It's from "of mice and men."

515
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,059
你会喜欢的
You'd like it.

516
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,066
那条小狗被杀了
Puppies get killed.

517
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:47,091
你带我来这是想杀我?
You bring me up here to kill me?

518
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:51,039
让那个你放在我身体里的东西
Make that thing you put inside me

519
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:53,070
炸了我的心脏?
blow up my damn heart?

520
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,097
你的心脏不会爆炸的  James
Your heart's not gonna blow up, James.

521
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:04,022
我们只是放进了一样东西  疑心
we put inside you was doubt.

522
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:09,096
那只表只是个心率监控器
Oh, the watch is a heart rate monitor,

523
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,054
没有其他作用了
but nothing more.

524
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:16,047
看看
Look.

525
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:24,006
我们给它的只是镇静剂  不是起搏器
We gave him a sedative, not a pacemaker.

526
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:28,000
我怎么知道是同一知兔子?
How do I know that's the same bunny?

527
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,002
你也可以在另外一只上也画个"8"
That you didn't just paint an"8" on another one?

528
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,018
随你怎么想
You don't.

529
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:44,077
你这个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

530
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,071
我想给你看的不是这只兔子
The rabbit wasn't the thing I wanted to show you.

531
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:09,005
什么...
What the...

532
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:24,003
你去过Alcatraz吗?
You ever been to Alcatraz?

533
00:40:24,015 --> 00:40:25,080
旅游的时候?
Take the tour?

534
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,058
现在你站的小岛上
Right now you're standing on a small island roughly

535
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,055
面积差不多是Alcatraz的两倍
twice the size of alcatraz.

536
00:40:35,023 --> 00:40:37,009
而那边那个
And that over there,

537
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:39,038
是你们的岛
that's your island,

538
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:42,002
一个你们了解和喜爱的地方
the one you've come to know and love.

539
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:47,000
我只是想让你知道
i just wanted you to know,

540
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,029
你无处可逃
there's nowhere to run.

541
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:54,099
你做这些只是...
You did all this just to...

542
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:59,029
只是为了把我关在一个破笼子里?
Just to keep me in a damn cage?

543
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:00,074
我们这么做是因为唯一可以赢得
We did all this because the only way

544
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:03,072
骗子的尊重的方法就是去欺骗他们
to gain a con man's respect is to con him.

545
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:08,019
你很不错  "Sawyer"
You're pretty good, "Sawyer."

546
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,020
但我们更出色
We're a lot better.

547
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:19,087
有意思的是  让你规规矩矩的
Funny thing is, us telling you

548
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:20,090
不是因为起搏器
about the pacemaker

549
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,090
而是因为我威胁会伤害她
wasn't what kept you in line. It was when i threatened her.

550
00:41:24,054 --> 00:41:27,055
你是这么努力得让她觉得 你不在乎她
You work so hard to make her think you don't care,

551
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:30,046
和你不需要她  但是...
that you don't need her, but...

552
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:35,055
"一个人爱上了另一个人就会疯狂
"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody."

553
00:41:37,046 --> 00:41:39,092
"不管这人是谁
"It don't make no difference who the guy is,

554
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:42,046
只要是和你在一起的"
as long as he's with you."

555
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:45,057
"我告诉你...
"I tell you...

556
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:47,046
"我告诉你如果一个人太孤单的话
"I tell you a guy gets too lonely

557
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,087
就会感到不适"
and he gets sick."

558
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,037
你到底在说什么?
- What the hell are you talking about?

559
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,022
是"人鼠之间"里的
- It's from "of mice and men."

560
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:56,057
你不看书吗?
Don't you read?

561
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,095
走吧
Come on.

562
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:11,033
回你的笼子去吧

563
