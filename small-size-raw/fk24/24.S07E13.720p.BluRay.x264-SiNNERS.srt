我们必须把她送到一层的安全屋

17
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,013
人质救援小组已各就各位

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,043
他们已经整装待发

副总统阁下

恐怖分子控制了白宫

00:00:54,064 --> 00:00:59,074
除非你能提供里边更多的情况

我在看白宫的人员清单

28
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:14,072
上面说 奥利维亚·泰勒

泰勒总统

32
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,073
上帝啊 不要
God, no.

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,020
如果你不乖乖开门
...if you don't open the door,

34
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:27,085
我会把你女儿的眼珠
I'm going to cut out your daughter's eyes

35
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:30,037
一个一个挖出来
One by one.

36
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:32,018
开门
Open the door.

37
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:34,014
-总统阁下  -别说了  开门
- Madam president... - no, open the door.

38
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,055
-开门  -我办不到

39
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,028
你有孩子吗  杰克
Do you have children, Jack?

40
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:39,072
我有个女儿
I have a daughter.

41
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:42,005
换了你能做到这样吗
Could you do what you're asking me to do?

42
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:44,015
站在这坐以待毙  眼睁睁看着她任人宰割
Just stand by and watch her butchered?

43
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:48,012
不能  阁下  但我不是美国总统
No, ma'am, but i am not the president of the united states.

44
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:53,030
我是总统  我命令你打开门
Well, i am the president, and i am ordering you to open that door.

45
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,097
好了  将军
All right, general,

46
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:04,017
你抓到我了
You've got me now.

47
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,074
没必要再扣留他们
There's no reason to hold anyone else.

48
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,021
放了他们
Let them go.

49
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:14,054
以下事件发生于晚上8点到9点
The following takes place between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m.

50
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:17,089
我们现在所了解到的情况是
Now, what we do know is that the president

51
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,019
恐怖分子展开袭击时总统正在白宫内
Was in the building when the attack took place,

52
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,039
她有可能和其他多数白宫工作人员
And she may have been taken hostage

53
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:25,030
一同被劫为人质
Along with numerous other white house personnel.

54
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:27,036
副总统黑沃斯当时不在白宫内
Vice president hayworth was not in the building,

55
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:30,050
据悉他已被转移到安全地带
And we're told he was moved to a secure location.

56
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:32,071
联邦调查局已设置了九重警戒线
The fbi has cordoned off a nine-block perimeter

57
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,057
副总统阁下
Mr vice president

58
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:35,077
是莫斯探员
That was agent moss.

59
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:37,024
他怎么说
What does he have to say?

60
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,044
他仍然请求您下令实施营救行动
He's still requesting that you authorize a rescue operation.

61
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:42,058
他有没有进一步关于里面情况的情报
Does he have any more intel About what the hell's going on in there?

62
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,008
没有  他布署了两个小组
No, sir. he deployed two units

63
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:45,009
使用深层抛物转向探测装置
With deep-band parabolics,

64
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:46,033
但是设备受到静电干扰
but all they were able get static.

65
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,052
他们认为朱玛正使用某种干扰设备
They think juma's using some kind of jamming equipment.

66
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:49,090
我们在白宫周围每个可以监测到的角度
They've also got spotters at every

67
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,025
也都安排有监控器
possible angle around the building

68
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:52,089
但仍然看不到里边的情况
But they haven't been able to see inside.

69
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:56,023
那我们还是搞不清朱玛是否抓到了总统
We still don't know whether juma has the president,

70
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:59,000
或者总统是否还躲在安全屋里
Or whether the president is lked inside the safe room?

71
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,020
是的  目前还不清楚
No, sir, we don't.

72
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,033
在我了解总统的处境之前
I will not authorize any action

73
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,067
不会下任何行动指令
Until i know the status of the president.

74
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,094
就这么回复莫斯探员
Relay that to agent moss.

75
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,007
是的  阁下
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:19,055
妈妈  我知道我伤透了您的心
Mom, i know that i hurt you.

77
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:21,052
对不起  是我拒您于千里之外
I'm so sorry for cutting you out of my life.

78
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:24,009
-没关系  -不  不对
- It's okay - no, it isn't.

79
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:26,086
您把我从竞选里开除是对的
You were right to fire me off the campaign.

80
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:29,059
我当时觉得您抛弃了我  所以一直不理您
I felt so betrayed, i turned my back on you.

81
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,043
奥利维亚  别再想这些了
Olivia, don't worry about it.

82
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,056
现在想想  当时太傻了
It all seems so stupid now.

83
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:36,033
希望您能原谅我
I hope you can forgive me.

84
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,014
亲爱的  我早就原谅你了
Darling, i forgave you a long time ago.

85
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,097
利维  听我说
Livy, you have to listen to me.

86
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,058
我们不会有事的
We really are going to be okay.

87
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:48,088
你只需睁大眼睛时刻准备好
Just keep your eyes open and be ready.

88
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:53,065
阿博
Abo.

89
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,065
-不  不  -起来
- No, no. - get up.

90
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:55,092
别碰她
Leave her alone!

91
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,069
-离她远点儿  -回去
- Get away from her! - get back!

92
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,062
别碰她  求你了
I said leave her alone! please!

93
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,069
奥利维亚  没事的  亲爱的
Olivia, it's okay, darling. it's okay!

94
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,043
比尔  我们得有所行动了
Bill, we need to move

95
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,086
把总统救出来
To try to save the president.

96
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:06,086
怎么干
How?

97
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,020
在安全屋里
In the lockdown room,

98
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:11,010
有5瓶CH-4虑毒罐
There were five canisters of ch-4.

99
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,090
咱们向朱玛投降之前 我把瓶口打开
Before we surrendered ourselves over to juma, i open the mouth

100
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:15,024
五分钟之内
Within the next few minutes,

101
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:17,017
那个房间会充满天然气
That room is going to be saturated with natural gas.

102
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,089
有一点火花就会爆炸
It's going to take one spark to set it off.

103
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,061
爆炸足够干掉大多数朱玛的手下
I think the explosion is going to be large enough to take out most of juma's men.

104
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,045
那时候你就行动
That's when you can make your move

105
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:25,095
怎么引爆
How do we set it off?

106
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,068
我跑到安全屋那儿
I'll make a run for the lockdown room.

107
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:28,095
引开他们的火力
Try and draw their fire.

108
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,049
只要一个流弹就够了
All we need is one stray bullet.

109
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:32,072
那等于自杀  杰克
That's a suicide play, jack.

110
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,056
没得选了
We don't have a choice.

111
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:35,089
只要确保你能救出总统
Just make sure you can get to the president

112
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:37,013
带她从这儿逃出去
And get her out of here.

113
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,043
她知道这个计划  并时刻准备着
She knows about the plan; she'll be ready.

114
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,056
你们在搞什么阴谋诡计
What are you planning?

115
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,007
是不是要行动了
Are you going to do something?

116
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:45,007
等我们行动时你就知道了  参议员
When it happens, you'll know about it, senator.

117
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:46,054
妈的  我要知道你们
Damn it, if you're planning something,

118
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,031
-到底在搞什么鬼  -闭嘴吧  参议员
- I want to know what it is. - senator, shut up.

119
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:50,054
读这份声明
Read this statement.

120
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:53,028
这是你对在我们的国家犯下的罪行
It is a confession of your crimes

121
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:54,094
所做的忏悔
Against my country.

122
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:59,090
你的残暴不仁  将被公诸于众
The atrocities that you have committed will now be seen by the whole world.

123
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:03,075
我会宣读你的声明的  将军
I'll read your statement, general,

124
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:07,049
但是我要你释放其他人质
But i need you to release the other hostages.

125
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,013
你已经得偿所愿了
You got what you came for.

126
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,076
你抓到了美国总统
You have the president of the united states.

127
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:18,057
为了表示诚信
As a sign of good faith...

128
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:22,044
我会释放一名人质
I will release one of the hostages.

129
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,091
你
You...

130
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,042
站起来
Stand up.

131
00:05:56,054 --> 00:06:00,083
还想让我释放人质吗  泰勒总统
Do you want me to release any hostages,president taylor?

132
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,065
你个王八蛋
You son of a bitch.

133
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,065
要么你乖乖地宣读这份声明
You will read this statement

134
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:08,059
要么我把所有人都宰了
Or i will do the same thing to everyone here...

135
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:11,085
先拿你女儿开刀
Starting with your daughter.

136
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:16,091
将军  上传线路已经设置好了
General, the uplink is complete.

137
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,093
好
All right.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,041
全世界都在翘首以盼了  总统阁下
The world is waiting, Madam president.

139
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:42,052
我是美国总统
"This is president of the united states.

140
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:45,096
6小时前  我在没有任何原因
"six hours ago, I ordered our armed forces

141
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:50,063
与预警的情况下  下令入侵了桑加拉
"to invade sangala without warning and without provocation.

142
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,020
这是一次侵略行为  是犯罪
"this attack was a criminal act motivated solely

143
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:58,050
是美国为达到滥用其强权和影响力的私欲
"by America's desire to exert its power and influence.

144
00:06:58,057 --> 00:07:00,039
你能禁播这个视频的吧
Tell me you're shutting this down.

145
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,050
做不到  阁下
we can't, sir.

146
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:03,061
这是直接实况传输到网络上的
It's a live feed straight to the internet.

147
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,044
我才不管那么多  把它给我禁播了
I don't care. shut it down.

148
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,021
它经由多个服务器传输   阁下
It's going out on multiple servers, sir.

149
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,088
光追踪这些服务器就得花上好几个小时
It would take hours just to trace them.

150
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,042
我是德里克·瓦茨
This is derek watts.

151
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,022
稍等
Hold on.

152
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,042
阁下  莫斯探员在视频会议上
Sir, it's agent  moss on teleconference.

153
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,055
接过来
Put him on.

154
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,039
阁下  你也看到那个视频了吧
Sir, are you getting this?

155
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:23,019
是的  全世界都看到了
Yes. so is the rest of the damn world.

156
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,093
副总统阁下  我相信朱玛来这里
Mr. vice president, i believe juma came here

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,083
是为了羞辱并在世人面前处决总统
To humiliate the president and stage a public execution.

158
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,043
营救行动已经准备好
We have a rescue operation in place.

159
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,087
就等您一声令下了
All we need is your authorization.

160
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:33,040
你根本就不知道朱玛究竟意欲何为
You don't know what juma's intentions are.

161
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:35,037
这可能只是他今后一系列条件的前奏
This could be a prelude to a set of demands.

162
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:36,091
他根本就不是来谈条件的  阁下
There are no demands here, sir.

163
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:38,061
他就是为了以牙还牙
This is about revenge.

164
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,078
朱玛知道他不可能活着走出白宫
Juma knows he'll never get out of the white house alive.

165
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,024
这只是你的推测  莫斯探员
You're speculating, agent moss.

166
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:44,088
我的顾问认为  最谨慎的做法
My advisor are telling me the most prudent course of action

167
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:48,005
就是和朱玛谈判
Is to try to initiate communication with juma.

168
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,059
我们已经试过了  他没有回应
We've been trying to do that. he hasn't responded.

169
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:52,052
阁下  朱玛根本没有谈判的打算
Sir, juma has no desire to negotiate anything.

170
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,076
他只图杀总统而后快
Hes going to kill the president.

171
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:55,073
阁下  我们的战术计划已经到位
Sir, we have a tactical plan in place.

172
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,019
我们会兵分两路
It's a two-pronged assault, and we're

173
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,040
肯定会杀朱玛一个措手不及
confident that it stands a good chance of catching juma off guard,

174
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,020
但时间不等人  现在必须开始行动
but we're losing time. We have to initiate now.

175
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:03,097
我不能授权可能会危及到
I cann authorize any action

176
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:05,064
总统生命的任何行动
At might result in the president's death.

177
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,063
继续想办法和朱玛对话
Keep trying to open dialogue with juma.

178
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:09,037
在他变卦前不许轻举妄动
hold your position until he told otherwise.

179
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,011
我会开着视频
I will keep this feed open.

180
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:13,094
"朱玛将军表明
"general juma has demonstrated

181
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:16,048
即使像美国一样的暴政国家..."
"that even a tyrant state like the u.s..."

182
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:17,091
准备好
Be ready.

183
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:19,058
杰克  听我说
Jack, listen to me.

184
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,085
朱玛不是单独行动的
Juma's not solely coordinating this attack.

185
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:23,022
什么意思
What do you mean?

186
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,052
我听见了他用卫星电话
I heard him talking on his sat phone.

187
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,072
和外面的人里应外合
He's coordinating with someone on the outside.

188
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,036
他们给朱玛实时情报
They were giving him real-time intel.

189
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:30,013
你认为那些是白宫内部人员吗
You think it's someone in the white house?

190
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,079
我不知道
I don't know.

191
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,083
但是就算我们制服朱玛
But even if we take juma down,

192
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,097
总统还是处在危险之中
The president may still be in danger.

193
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,050
你是我知道的
You're the only one I know

194
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:40,080
唯一一个可以做这件事的人  杰克
Who can do this, jack.

195
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,054
查出朱玛的同党是谁
Find out who juma's working with.

196
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,032
莫斯探员  白宫西翼发生了爆炸
Agent moss, a device has been detonated in the west wing.

197
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:02,036
副总统阁下   白宫里发生了爆炸
Mr. vice president, there's been an explosion at the white house

198
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,069
-爆炸  -是的
An explosion? yes, sir.

199
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,089
总统那边的网络视频信号丢失
The president's internet feed has gone dark.

200
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:05,096
我们看到了  怎么回事
We saw that. what's happening?

201
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,040
不清楚  阁下
I don't know, sir,

202
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,053
我要下命令行动了  出发
But we're going in under my authority. let's go.

203
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,049
那不是你能决定的
That is not your decision.

204
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,047
全体注意  执行D计划
all teams, attack plan delta.

205
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:14,000
-莫斯探员  听我的指令  -十万火急
Agent moss, you're under orders! agent moss! code green.

206
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:17,024
冲  冲  冲
Go, go, go!

207

皮尔斯  保护总统

208
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:35,012
总统阁下  您没事吧
Madam president, are you okay? mm-hmm.

209
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,043
我们必须马上离开这
We need get out of here right now.

210
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,086
你们都跟着我
Both of you, come with me.

211
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:40,003
我们走  这边
Let's go. this way.

212
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:54,061
总统阁下  身子放低
Madam president, get down.

213
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,021
等安全了再起身
Stay low till I know we're clear.

214
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:00,048
诺加兹

杀了那些人质
Kill the hostages.

216
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:04,095

00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:08,012
乌铎

我们仍在搜查白宫西翼
We're still sweeping the west wing.

我知道
I understand.

244
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:15,048
一旦我们确定白宫安全
Now once we get the all clear,

00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:17,031
我们会将您转移到安德鲁空军基地

美国人民必须知道

总统仍旧坐镇白宫

遵命  总统阁下

253
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,036
我们牺牲了多少人
How many people did we lose?

254
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,076
还不知道
It's too early to tell.

255
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,000
医务组正在治疗伤员
Medical teams are on their way to treat the wounded.

256
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,084
我们会在白宫西翼设置一个急救点
We're going to set up a triage unit in the east wing.

257
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,084

00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:48,028
我还要尽快知道我的丈夫怎么样了
And i need to know how my husband's doing.

谢谢
Thank you.

265
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,019
皮尔斯探员怎么样了
How's agent pierce?

266
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,086
医生说他会没事的
They said he's gonna be okay.

267
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,070
你还好吗
What about you?

268
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,094
我不知道
I'm not sure.

269
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:23,021
我仍不能相信发生的一切
I still can't believe this happened.

270
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:25,042
我还以为他会把我们都杀光
I thought they were gonna kill all of us.

271
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:29,079
当时我太害怕了
I was so scared.

272
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,022
已经结束了
It's over...

273
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:38,006
我们安全了
And we're safe...

274
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:41,000
得感谢那些英勇无畏的人们
Thanks to a lot of brave people.

275
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,080
打扰一下  总统阁下
Excuse me, madam president,

276
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:46,010
副总统在安全线路上
The vice president is on a secure line.

277
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:48,024
我马上就来
I'll be right there.

278
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:54,078
你说要把以前不愉快的事忘掉
Did you mean what you said

279
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:57,045
是认真的吗
About putting the past behind us?

280
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:59,048
我当然是认真的
Of course i meant it.

281
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:02,085
我再也不想失去你了
I don't ever want to lose you again.

282
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:07,026
不会的
You won't.

283
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:50,033
总统安全了  杰克
The president's safe, jack.

284
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,031
她在总统官邸  很安全
She's in the residence. she's secure.

285
00:14:56,017 --> 00:14:59,048
我很遗憾  杰克
I am so sorry, jack.

286
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:02,011
我知道他是你的好朋友
I know that he was your friend.

287
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:04,065
去死的本该是我
It was supposed to be me.

288
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:10,029
本该是我去引爆炸弹的
I was supposed to set off the explosion

289
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,036
让他保护总统
So that he could secure the president.

290
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:19,083
他为国家捐躯  死得其所
He died protecting his country.

291
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,053
是的
Yeah.

292
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,021
这次袭击还没完
This isn't over yet.

293
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,048
莫斯探员
Agent moss...

294
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:40,062
朱玛一伙不是单独在行动
Juma and his men were not working alone.

295
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,099
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

296
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:44,009
我和总统躲在安全屋的时候
When i was in the lockdown with the president,

297
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:46,032
比尔说  他听见朱玛在卫星电话上
Bill said he heard juma talking on a sat phone.

298
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,089
从外面的人那里获得实时情报
Said he was getting real-time intel From someone on the ouide.

299
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:50,016
-是谁  -我不知道
Who? i don't know.

300
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,090
重点是  袭击还没有结束
The point is, i don't think this threat is over,

301
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:53,033
我不认为总统已经安全了
And i don't think the president is safe.

302
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,046
你确定布坎南的情报可靠吗
You sure buchanan heard this right?

303
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,065
如果情报不可靠他是不会信口开河的
He wouldn't have told me unless he were sure.

304
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,097
现在唯一的线索就是莱恩·伯内特
And right now the only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.

305
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:02,007
他知道这次袭击是在白宫
He knew about the attack

306
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,051
他很有可能知道
On the white house, and chances are,

307
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,041
和朱玛通话的人是何方神圣
He's gonna know who juma was talking to.

308
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,098
好吧  好吧  我会和他谈谈这件事的
All right, all right, i'll talk to him.

309
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,061
不  总统已准备赦免他了
No, the president already offered him immunity.

310
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,088
他拒绝了
He turned it down.

311
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,052
他什么都不会告诉你
He's not gonna tell you anything,

312
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,075
但我能令他开口
But he will talk to me.

313
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:17,002
为什么  你难道又要给他用刑吗
Why is that, jack, 'cause you tortured him?

314
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,096
我不需要碰他  只要让他放明白点
I don't need to touch him. i just need him to think

315
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,019
我是不会善罢甘休的
I'm there to finish what i started.

316
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:21,039
我向你保证
And i promise you

317
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,009
他会对我们和盘托出
He will tell us everything we need to know.

318
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,073
拉里  拜托了
Larry, please,

319
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,086
这是比尔死前最后的遗愿
The last thing bill asked for before he died

320
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:30,067
他希望我能战斗到底  这是我欠他的
Was for me to follow this through. I owe him that.

321
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:32,054
我向你保证
Look, i give you my word.

322
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,084
我不会动伯内特一根汗毛
I will not touch burnett.

323
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,014
杰克  听着  我理解你的朋友
Jack, look, i understand about your friend,

324
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,061
真的  但总统命令我羁押你
I do, but i got standing orders from the president to take you into custody.

325
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:40,014
我必须得带你回调查局
I gotta get you back to fbi,

326
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:41,055
但我保证会调查的  好吗
But i promise you i'll look into this, all right?

327
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:44,055
鲍威尔探员  给鲍尔戴上手铐
Agent powell, handcuff mr. bauer.

328
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:45,078
带他去2号集结地
Take him down to staging area b.

329
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,022
先生  请把双手放到脑后
Sir, put your hands on top of your head.

330
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:49,075
-拉里  -如果你只想说他是对的
- Larry...  - if you're gonna tell me he's right about this

331
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:51,045
我不想听
I don't want to hear it.

332
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,038
这就是问题所在
Yes, that's the problem. you're not

333
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:53,012
你根本听不进他说的话
listening to what he said

334
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,062
你能不能别为他辩护了
When are you gonna stop defending this guy?

335
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:55,096
我不是在维护他
I'm not defending him,

336
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,079
我是觉得他说的是对的
I'm defending a good idea.

337
00:16:57,086 --> 00:16:59,049
我说了我会调查的
I just said i will look into this!

338
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:02,043
干你的活儿  把这栋楼封锁起来
Now do you job, finish locking down the building.

339
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:17,001
雷诺兹探员
Agent reynolds.

340
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:20,045
我要见总统  是紧急情况

345

多谢

346
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:31,006
总统和她女儿都在官邸中

347
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,036
检查过她们了

和参谋长联席会议成员
And the joint chiefs as soon as possible.

351
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,006
除了总统那  白宫其他地方的通讯
We're routing all white house

352
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,007
正在恢复中
communications except the president

353
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:42,091
我们还建立了个临时指挥所
And we're setting up a temporary command post.

354
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,047
好
Good.

355
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,031
卡宁先生  我有事找你
Mr. kanin, i need to speak with you.

356
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:48,001
我要去见总统
I'm on my way to see the president.

357
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,095
我知道  但事情特别紧急
Yes, i know, sir, but it's extremely urgent.

358
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,048
只要耽搁您一会
It'll only take a few moments.

359
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:53,012
好吧
All right.

360
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,029
怎么了  沃克探员
What is it, agent walker?

361
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,075
我们注意到一些新的情报
Some new intel has just come to our attention

362
00:17:56,082 --> 00:17:58,022
需要立即做出反应
And we need to act on it immediately.

363
00:17:58,029 --> 00:17:59,092
我想找总统  但被挡住了
I tried to reach the president, but i couldn't get through.

364
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,041

- I'm listening.  - sir, the threat to

365
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,069
还没完全解除
the president may not be over.

366
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:05,096
我们有理由相信  朱玛背后有人撑腰
We've reason to believe that general juma was not acting alone.

367
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,040
比尔·布坎南死前
Before bill buchanan died,

368
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:10,073
他看到朱玛和某人用卫星电话联络

369
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,024
现在  我们能确定

370
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:18,037
调查局探员刚进入白宫
That fbi agents entered the white house moments ago,

371
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:21,034
有报告称听到持续的枪声
And there were reports of sustained gunfire.

372
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,065
看上去当局已经控制了白宫西翼
It appears that authorities are now in control of the west wing,

373
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:29,012
我们还在等待调查局有关人质的消息
And we are expecting word from our fbi source Of the status of the hostages.

374
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,075
目前没有任何官方的消息
While there has been no official comment...

375
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:32,092
有什么消息
So what have we got?

376
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,042
总统还活着
The president's alive.

377
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,013
你确定吗
Are you sure?

378
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:40,066
我们同时监视着不同部门的服务器
We've been monitoring interagency servers.

379
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:43,013
消息传出来   朱玛死了  泰勒还活着
Word just went out. juma's dead, taylor survived.

380
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,010
你猜发生什么了
What happened do you think?

381
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:47,057
细节还不清楚
We don't know any details yet,

382
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:51,061
但我们会继续监视的
But we'll keep monitoring.

383
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:57,045
你得佩服下那婊子
Well... you gotta admire the damn bitch.

384
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,015
她不会轻言放弃
She doesn't give up easily.

385
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:00,055
对不起  长官  我们
I'm sorry, sir. we, uh,

386
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:03,089
没能完全控制局面
Just didn't have enough control over the situation.

387
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:06,036
格雷格  你看上去很紧张
Greg, you look tense.

388
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,017
帮帮忙
Do me a favor.

389
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,028
喝点酒  放松下
Have a drink, relax.

390
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:21,075
朱玛遵守了诺言
Juma held up his part of the bargain.

391
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,025
我们的目的都达到了
We're getting what we wanted.

392
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:25,035
就我而言  一切还尽在掌握
As far as i'm concerned, everything's still on track.

393
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:28,086
武器在哪了
Where are the weapons now?

394
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:34,010
几个小时后我们就可以卸货了
A shipment should ready for pickup in the next couple of hours.

395
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,063
好  给查普曼打电话
Good. get chapman on the phone.

396
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,087
我想确定几个目标
I want to nail down some targets.

397
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:56,076
长官  你要的直升机已经过来了

400
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,003
把他关在指挥中心

401
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,023

You're taking jack bauer back to fbi?

405
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,004

408
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:17,038
怎么了

我刚和沃克探员谈过

她告诉我朱玛可能和别人

411
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:23,045
暗中勾结  而且有可能
On the outside, and that there may be

412
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:26,009
还有对总统的其他威胁
An ongoing threat to the president.

413
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:28,059
是的
Yes, that's true.

414
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:32,005
我希望你能让杰克·鲍尔
I want you to send jack bauer

415
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,083
去审讯莱恩·伯内特
to question ryan burnett.

416
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:36,080
莫斯探员
Agent moss?

417
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:38,076
长官  我觉得那样不好
Sir, i think that's a mistake.

418
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,005
沃克探员和我说了你的顾忌
Yes, agent walker shared your concerns with me,

419
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,027
我也经过了深思熟虑
And i've given this some thought.

420
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:46,011
如果伯内特确实知道朱玛的同伙是谁
If burnett does know who juma was working with,

421
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:47,060
鲍尔的手段可能会是
Bauer's approach may be our best

422
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,007
得到情报的最好机会
chance to get that information

423
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,004
恕我直言  长官  鲍尔差点杀了他
With respect, sir, bauer almost killed this man.

424
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,085
我当时在现场  莫斯探员
I was there, agent moss,

425
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:56,055
但这次审讯是可以控制的
But this will be a controlled interrogation.

426
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:58,075
我们利用伯内特对鲍尔的恐惧心理
We're gonna play on burnett's fears.

427
00:20:58,075 --> 00:21:01,025
鲍尔只要单独现身
Bauer's presence alone should be enough

428
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:02,035
就足够让他开口了
To intimidate him into talking.

429
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,072
长官  鲍尔是个不确定因素
Sir, bauer is a wild card.

430
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,016
他进屋见到伯内特之后
We have no idea what he'll do

431
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:06,052
不知道他会做出什么来
When he gets in that room with burnett.

432
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,013
我考虑到这事会有风险
I realize there's a risk.

433
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,040
所以此事得由我全权负责
That's why you're going to do this under my authority And my authority alone.

434
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,067
你不和总统说这事吗
You're not taking this to the president?

435
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:17,014
不  如有意外
No. if something does go wrong,

436
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,027
我希望总统不受牵连
I want to make sure the president is protected.

437
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:22,061
恕我直言  我觉得你不告诉总统
With respect, sir, i think you're not telling the president

438
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,078
是因为你知道她决不会批准
'cause you know she'd never allow this.

439
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:27,001
你的异议我清楚了  莫斯探员
You've made your objections clear, agent moss.

440
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:29,058
我们不要再争论此事了
I'm not going to debate this with you.

441
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:32,032
我让你带鲍尔去审讯伯内特
I want you to take bauer to question burnett.

442
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,009
这是命令  你明白吗
That's a direct order. do you understand?

443
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:36,039
明白
I understand.

444
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,076
我希望你能对此次审讯全程监控
And i'm counting on you to supervise every second of that interrogation.

445
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,009
我期待事成之后  你能有份完整报告
I'll expect a full report as soon as you're done.

446
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,013
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

447
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:54,061
我希望能够亲自和死者家属谈话
I want to speak personally to the families of everyone we lost tonight, so...

448
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,094
通知到他们后和我说一声
Keep me informed as they're notified.

449
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,044
没问题  总统阁下
Absolutely, madam president.

450
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,081
安吉拉·纳尔逊到的时候
And the minute angela nelson

451
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:02,045
直接带她来见我
Gets here, send her straight up to me.

452
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:06,012
需要准备对全国民众的讲话稿
We need to start working on the speech to the country.

453
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,065
当然  总统阁下
Of course, madam president.

454
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:12,046
帕特里克
Patrick,

455
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:16,036
你刚经历了一场严酷的考验
You have just been through a terrible ordeal.

456
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,063
你确定没事吗
Are you sure you're okay?

457
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,020
我没事的
I'll be fine.

458
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:23,054
这事对专心工作有帮助
It helps to focus on work.

459
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
我理解
I understand.

460
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:31,031
谢谢你  帕特里克
Thank you, patrick.

461
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:38,015
感谢上帝你没事
Thank god you're all right.

462
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,046
你感觉如何
How you feeling?

463
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:47,099
仿佛刚从噩梦中醒来
Like i just woke up from a nightmare.

464
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:50,003
真难以置信  伊桑
It was unbelievable, ethan.

465
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,070
确实不堪回想  奥利维亚还好吗
I can't even imagine it. how's olivia?

466
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:55,063
她被吓到了  但会好起来的
She's shaken up, but she's going to be okay.

467
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,020
听到这我很欣慰
I'm glad to hear it.

468
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:59,030
伊桑  今晚我们牺牲了很多好战友
We lost some good people tonight, ethan.

469
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:02,001
要竭尽所能多方寻求帮手
We're going to need all the help we can get.

470
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:05,048
我考虑让奥利维亚加入进来
I'm thinking about bringing olivia on

471
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:08,045
担任特别顾问
As a special advisor.

472
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:09,098
总统阁下
Madam president,

473
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,055
经过此次事件  您不愿与女儿分开
I can understand your not wanting to be separated

474
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:14,032
这我能理解
From your daughter after what's happened.

475
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,012
正是因为发生了这次事件
Especially after what's happened,

476
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,046
我们需要有能力的人加入
We need people who can do the job.

477
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:19,042
我对奥利维亚的能力无可置疑
I'm not disputing olivia's competence,

478
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:22,076
但她也是个政治负担
but she's also a political Liability.

479
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,043
大选时她的所为大家都还历历在目
Nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign,

480
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,073
她对媒体散布谣言
Leaking damaging personal information

481
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,033
诽谤您的竞选对手
About your opponent to the press.

482
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,034
奥利维亚知错了
Olivia knows what she did was wrong.

483
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,077
她差点毁掉您的竞选
She almost cost you the election.

484
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:34,027
她已经变了
She's changed.

485
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:36,071
伊桑  我们有谈过此事
We talked about it, ethan,

486
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:38,094
她也表示自己将负全责
And she is accepting full responsibility.

487
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,088
她已经吸取教训了
She has learned from her mistakes.

488
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:45,062
我希望忘掉过去的种种  放眼未来
I'm willing to put the past behind us so we can move ahead.

489
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:47,002
我还是认为此事不妥
I still think it's a mistake.

490
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,012
我不在乎你怎么认为
I don't care what you think!

491
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:58,020
抱歉 伊桑
I am so sorry, ethan.

492
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:00,067
你知道我也不想这样
You know i don't mean that.

493
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:03,044
但我意已决
But i've made up my mind.

494
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,064
我要奥利维亚加入我的幕僚之中
I want olivia to join my administration.

495
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,001
并且我希望由你来发起
And i want it to come from you.

496
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,081
我
Me?

497
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:13,011
由你亲自任命她职务
Your offering her this position

498
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,058
能有助于你们俩化干戈为玉帛
Would be a good way to extend an olive branch.

499
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:21,069
我要你们俩相安无事
I need the two of you to make peace.

500
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:24,076
遵命  总统阁下
All right, madam president.

501
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:27,043
我会和她谈的
I'll talk to her.

502
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,079
谢谢你  伊桑
Thank you, ethan.

503
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:33,050
我听说沃克探员之前找我
I understand agent walker was trying to reach me.

504
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:35,043
对  我联系了她
That's right, but i spoke to her.

505
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,010
她有何事
What did she want?

506
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,070
这是一些琐碎公事  总统阁下
Just some procedural matters, madam president.

507
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,041
我已处理了
I took care of it.

508
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,067
拉里  你找我吗
Larry, you wanted to see me?

509
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:19,031
我刚接到伊桑·卡宁的电话
I just got off the phone with ethan kanin.

510
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,065
听着  我不想背着你做事
Look, i didn't want to go behind your back,

511
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:26,095
但是是你让我没有选择余地的
But you didn't leave me any choice.

512
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:28,059
我不给你留余地吗
I didn't leave you a...?

513
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:30,046
你怎么就不能选择服从命令听指挥呢
How about you choose to follow orders?

514
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,019
我很抱歉  拉里
I'm sorry, larry.

515
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:33,066
不  我觉得你不会
No. i don't think you are.

516
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:37,000
拉里  今天我亲眼目睹了杰克的作为
Larry, i've seen jack do some terrible things today.

517
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,080
粗暴之极  我仍不敢苟同
Things that i still can't justify.

518
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:40,030
但结果却每次都证明他是对的
But he has been right every time.

519
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,080
知道吗  我不禁在想
And you know what? i can't help but think

520
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:43,030
如果我们能让他放手去干
That maybe if we had just stayed out of his way,

521
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:44,070
或许这些悲剧都不会发生
None of this would have happened.

522
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:47,064
听着  我很抱歉
Look, i am sorry

523
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:48,084
不该背着你做事
That i went behind your back,

524
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:51,008
但我向你保证  伯内特的处置方式
But i... i promise you this play with burnett

525
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:53,005
一定得按杰克的意思办
Will go down just the way jack says.

526
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:57,038
如果你觉得自己和杰克一条战线
If you think you're going with bauer,

527
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:58,065
那你一定是疯了
You are out of your mind.

528
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:00,019
就算你有能耐
You may have gotten

529
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,012
让白宫发令  可我仍是行动指挥
A white house order, but i'm still running this operation.

530
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,086
我会带杰克去见伯内特
I'll take bauer to see Burnett.

531
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:07,079
你回调查局
You're going back to fbi.

532
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:10,090
我会把你扫地出门
I want you to clean out your office

533
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:12,056
并收回你的联邦探员徽章
And hand in your badge.

534
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:15,023
我要将你无限期停职
I'm suspending you indefinitely.

535
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,080
好吧  我知道你很不爽  但事情还没完
Okay. i know that you're upset larry, but this isn't over.

536
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,000
你仍然需要我
You're going to need me.

537
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:21,021
我需要的是能让我信任的人
What i need are people that i can trust.

538
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,024
我原以为你就是
I thought that was you.

539
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,090
听好了  你别以为自己得偿所愿了
Look, you may think you got what you wanted,

540
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:51,047
让蕾妮背着我行事
Getting renee to go behind my back,

541
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:54,021
但伊桑命令我  让你去审问伯内特
But ethan kanin ordered me to let you question burnett.

542
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,051
你审问时  我都会全程死死盯住你
I'm going to be watching you every second you're in there.

543
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:58,018
你胆敢让我不爽  你就死定了
You do one thing i don't like, you're finished.

544
00:26:58,024 --> 00:27:00,065
-听懂了吗  -明白
You understand me? understood.

545
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:04,088
你不该因此牵连蕾妮
You should leave renee out of this.

546
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:07,025
她也只是做自己认为对的事情
She was just doing what she thought was right.

547
00:27:07,032 --> 00:27:09,019
是吗  她可能会因此丢了饭碗
Yeah? well, she may lose her job over it.

548
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:10,089
她是你手下最棒的探员
She's the best agent you've got.

549
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,022
她无视我的权威
She circumvented my authority.

550
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,043
对此我不能置之不理
I can't just ignore that.

551
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,033
我认识她9年了
I've known this woman for nine years,

552
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,030
从未见过她做事会像
And i've never seen her do the kind of things she's done

553
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,093
过去9小时所做的那样
In the last nine hours.

554
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:48,018
我们已将目标缩小到 12个东部沿海城市
We've narrowed the list down To 12 targets along the eastern seaboard.

555
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:49,021
都在发射基地300公里半径范围以内
They're all within 300 kilometers of the base.

556
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,055
有多少人
How many people?

557
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:52,075
每个目标区大概1至1.5万人
10,000 to 15,000 in each target zone.

558
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:55,006
死亡率估计会是多少
And our kill ratio would be what?

559
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:56,040
我们选择的城市
Well, we've chosen these areas

560
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,072
都是人口密度最高的
for maximum population density

561
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,096
按此估算估计高达80%
So the ratio could be as high as 80%.

562
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:02,020
希望我们永远都不必真去确证这个结果
Let's hope we never have to find out.

563
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:04,097
把这些坐标传到战术行动组去
Get these coordinates down to the boys in tac-ops.

564
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:07,013
-让他们运作起来  -遵命  长官
Have them start programming them in. Yes, sir.

565
00:28:13,014 --> 00:28:16,054
我们刚拦截到调查局的一条信息
We just intercepted a flash memo from the fbi.

566
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:20,028
杰克·鲍尔正在去肯尼迪纪念医院的路上
Jack bauer is on his way to kennedy memorial hospital

567
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,078
准备去审问伯内特
To question burnett.

568
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:24,058
鲍尔已被拘捕了  怎么可能还去审问
Bauer was arrested. how is this possible?

569
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:26,022
白宫下达了总统行政命令
There was an executive order from the white house

570
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,042
让鲍尔有权审问伯内特
Giving bauer access to burnett.

571
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,056
鲍尔是不到黄河心不死的
Bauer will finish what he started.

572
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,016
伯内特早晚会和盘托出
Burnett will tell him everything.

573
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,029
不  长官  他不会的
No, he won't, sir.

574
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:36,083
我已派人去医院干掉伯内特
I have already sent somebody to the hospital to deal with burnett.

575
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,063
到时候将一并干掉鲍尔
He can take care of bauer at the same time.

576
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,017
你派谁去的
Who did you send?

577
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,067
奎恩
Quinn.

578
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:44,097
奎恩身手不错
Oh. quinn's good.

579
00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:47,061
鲍尔也不好对付
Bauer's good, too.

580
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:50,058
莫斯探员  我们已经封锁了整个楼层
Agent moss, we've locked down the entire floor.

581
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:51,068
在伯内特房间
We equipped burnett's room

582
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:53,065
我们安装了两组监视器和窃听器
With two cameras and audio surveillance.

583
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,078
他在哪
Where is he?

584
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:56,002
大厅尽头
Down the hall.

585
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:57,048
稍等一会
It's going to be a moment.

586
00:28:57,055 --> 00:28:58,062
大夫要让他苏醒过来
Doctor has to revive him.

587
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,062
为什么  发生什么事了
Why? what happened?

588
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:01,042
我们给他注射了强效镇定剂
He was given a heavy sedative.

589
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,076
刚到时他情况很糟糕
He was in pretty bad shape when he got here.

590
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:05,089
温顿大夫  联邦探员拉里·莫斯

我知道你们到这
I understand youe here

593
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,016
-是要审问我的病人  -没错
To interrogate my patient. that's right.

594
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:10,083

Well, he's still recovering from his last Interrogation,

595
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,047
所以  如果你们又要来虐待他
so if you're here to brutalize him again,

596
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:13,093

599

我相信他的同伙
And i believe the people he's working with

600
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:21,081
正企图卷土重来  如果您对此有意见...
Want to try it again, so if you've got a problem...

601
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,091
我们不会伤害他的  大夫
We won't harm him, doctor.

602
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:25,051
审讯都在可控范围进行  拜托了

-罗伯特吗  -对

00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:26,001
你心脏手术后还在康复阶段吗
You're recovering from heart surgery?

611
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,014
是的

612
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:29,021
你有妻子吗  罗伯特

子孙满堂

620
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:46,023
来探望他的时候  吵死人了
Make a hell of a noise when they visit.

621
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:21,028
-胳膊怎么样了  -再过几小时
- How's your arm? - I should be back

622

on my feet in a couple of hours

623
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,045
你呢  女士
And you, ma'am?

624
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:27,045
我没事  吃点阿司匹林就得了
Oh, it's nothing a little aspirin won't take care of.

625
00:33:28,082 --> 00:33:31,012
谢谢你的救命之恩
I want to thank you for what you did.

626
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,060
你为我挡了一枪  救了我一命
You took a bullet for me. you saved my life.

627
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:38,057
这是我应该做的  女士
There is no need to thank me, ma'am.

628
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:40,043
也对  你只是尽职尽责罢了
Right, you were just doing your job.

629
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,077
只不过  这一回
Only in this case,

630
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:43,094
你4年前就退休了
It wasn't really your job since you retired

631
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,027
这就不再是你的职责了
Four years ago.

632
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:46,091
是的  女士  这倒是真的
Yes, ma'am, that's true.

633
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:49,044
能告诉我为什么退休吗
Do you mind if i ask you why?

634
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:54,081
跟玛撒·洛根有关系吗
Did it have to do with martha logan?

635
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:59,062
我和玛撒...曾经是好朋友
Martha and i were... close.

636
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:03,026
发生在她身上的一切  对你打击肯定不小
It must have been hard for you-- what happened to her.

637
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:04,099
往事不堪回事啊
I'd prefer not to talk about it.

638
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:06,069
对不起
I'm sorry.

639
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:09,023
没必要道歉
You don't have to apologize.

640
00:34:12,087 --> 00:34:15,010
把我当朋友吧  皮尔斯探员
I hope you won't be a stranger, agent pierce.

641
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:16,030
谢谢你
Thank you.

642
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,047
你
And, uh...

643
00:34:19,054 --> 00:34:20,087
可以叫我亚伦
It's aaron.

644
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,001
好的  亚伦
Okay, aaron.

645
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:27,028
你好好休息吧
You get some rest.

646
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:30,085
如果可以的话
I'd like to head back to the residence now

647
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:32,052
我想打道回府了
If that's okay?

648
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:33,082
奥利维亚
Olivia...

649
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,032
我正找你呢
I was just coming to see you.

650
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,066
你没事太好了
I'm glad you're all right.

651
00:34:38,073 --> 00:34:40,083
谢谢
Thank you.

652
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:42,066
有时间说两句话吗
You have a moment to talk?

653
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:44,040
当然
Sure.

654
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:55,064
坦率地说
The blunt fact of the matter is...

655
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:59,048
政府遭受了巨大的损失
This administration has just suffered some terrible losses,

656
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,018
我们需要你的帮助
And we need help.

657
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:04,085
总统和我想让你加入内阁
The president and i would like you to consider coming on board

658
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:06,089
担任总统的特别顾问
As special advisor to the president.

659
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,052
我
I, uh...

660
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:15,026
不得不承认  我有点吃惊
I have to say i'm a little surprised.

661
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:17,066
-吃惊  -我是说  竟是你正式批准的
- Surprised? - oh, that you'd sign off on this.

662
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:21,030
你妈妈说已决定冰释前嫌
You mother said she's ready to put the past behind her...

663
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,037
我也会这么做
And so am i.

664
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,075
竞选的时候  我做事过于激进
I overstepped my bounds in the campaign

665
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:29,014
我大错特错了
and i was wrong.

666
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,018
你能认识到这点  太好了
I'm glad you see it that way.

667
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:33,081
但是让我困扰的不是过去  伊桑
But it's not the past that concerns me, ethan.

668
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:36,008
而是现在发生的一切
It's what's happening right now,

669
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,085
是从我妈妈接管政府以后  发生的一切
And what's been happening ever since my mother took office.

670
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:42,009
你什么意思
Excuse me?

671
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,082
如果有个称职的首席顾问
Do you think any of this would have happened

672
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:45,046
你觉得这一切的一切
If my mother had a chief advisor

673
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:48,053
还会发生吗
Who knew what the hell was going on in her administration?

674
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,090
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

675
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:52,077
整个政府上下都被腐化了
Her government was corrupted on every level,

676
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,080
而这一切居然就在你的眼皮底下发生
And it all happened right under your nose.

677
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:59,034
即使你自己也觉得这种失败让你良心不安
Even you have to admit, it's an unconscionable failure on your part.

678
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:03,008
坦白地说
Frankly, i'm surprised

679
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:04,091
我不明白为什么你还不辞职
You haven't tendered your resignation.

680
00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:08,081
你这样对我说话太放肆了
You have no right to speak to me that way.

681
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:11,065
说话要实事求是
You don't know what you're talking about.

682
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:13,049
你有证据吗
You don't have the facts.

683

我正要找证据呢

And i am going to make sure that that person never is in a position to do it again.

686
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:29,007

我会在这盯着你的

你动他一根汗毛  就别想再继续了
You lay one finger on him, it's over.

690
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:02,071

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,027
他恢复知觉了

还记得我吗

696
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:07,070
天哪
Oh, my god.

697
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:11,017
你来这干嘛
What the hell are you doing here?

698
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:13,028
我刚从白宫赶过来啊

704

705
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:25,022
你离我远点
You stay the hell away from me.

706
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:27,072
给我叫律师来
And i want to talk to a lawyer right now.

707
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,086
你听见没  我要见律师

你哪也去不成了
You're not going anywhere.

710

这就你跟我了  哥们
It's just you and me, pal.

711
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:37,047
你还真以为你能躲得过去啊
Did you really think you were going to get away with it?

712
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,024
来人啊  救我
Somebody please, help me!

713
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,071
别白费唇舌了  没人来救你
You're wasting your breath. they're not coming for you.

714
00:38:42,077 --> 00:38:45,001
别打我  我全招
Please don't hurt me. i'll tell you anything you want.

715
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:47,001
你们听见没  我愿意全招
Do you hear that-- i'm ready to talk.

716
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:48,034
你们想知道什么
I'll tell you anything

717
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,085
我都告诉你们  请别把他跟我关一起
You want to know! just get him out of here!

718
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:53,015
-我全都招  -他们懒得理你了
- I'm ready to talk! - They're done talking to you.

719
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:55,025
所以才叫我来
That's why they sent me.

720
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,009
你不能这么做  你无权这么做
Please, you can't do this! you have no right!

721
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,076
这样做违法
This isn't legal!

722
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:00,076
怎么回事
What happened?

723
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:01,076
不清楚
I don't know.

724
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,026
好像接收不到音频了
Looks like we lost the sound feed.

725
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:04,099
给我点时间
Give me a second.

726
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:08,093
还跟你讲什么法律  伯内特先生
There are no laws in here, mr. burnett.

727
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,080
你助纣为虐
You aided and abetd terrorists,

728
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:12,025
差点害死了美国总统
Who then tried to kill the president of the united states.

729
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:15,037
你该得到你应有的惩罚了
Now you have to answer for that.

730
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:17,011
法律在你这  已经不适用了
The rules don't apply to you anymore.

731
00:39:17,017 --> 00:39:19,041
不  不要  你们不能让他动我
No, please, please, you can't let him touch me!

732
00:39:19,048 --> 00:39:21,048
-不要  不要让他动我  -闭嘴
- Please, you can't let him do this...! - shut up!

733
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:26,088
中继线可能有点小故障
It could be a glitch in the trunk line.

734
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,028
-该死  快修啊  -我修着呢  长官
- Damn it, fix the thing! - i'm trying, sir.

735
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:51,097
鲍尔
Bauer?

736
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:53,057
他破坏了电子锁

737
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:55,020
-还有别的路可以进去吗  -没有

738
00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:57,084
杰克
Jack...

739
00:40:58,098 --> 00:41:00,064
该死  鲍尔  给我开门
Damn it, bauer, open the door!

740
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,077
让保安封锁整个医院
Have security lock down the hospital.

741
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:28,044
发出全面缉捕通告  全力捉拿杰克·鲍尔

It's done.

745
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:13,008
伯内特死了

746
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:14,032
鲍尔呢
And bauer?

747
00:42:14,038 --> 00:42:16,002
栽赃给他了
They'll think he killed burnett.

748
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:18,072
这样便神不知鬼不觉了
So, nobody will know That we were involved.

749
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,019
妙计
Good.

750
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:22,053
那当然
Yeah.

751
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:25,086
这下我们可以看笑话了
Now we're having some fun.

752
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:29,033
我是莫斯
Agent moss.

753
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,090
拉里  我是杰克  听我说
Larry, it's jack. listen to me.

754
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:31,045
你在哪
Where are you?

755
00:42:31,045 --> 00:42:32,076
我没有杀伯内特
I didn't kill burnett.

756
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:34,084
-我是被陷害的  -陷害
- i'm being set up. - set up?

757
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,042
有人在屋里释放了神经毒气

758
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,067
让我动弹不得

759
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:39,003
他从天花板上下来  杀了伯内特
He came through the ceiling and killed burnett.

760
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,094

I swear to you, i'm not lying. i watched him do it.

761
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:43,091
你马上回来  我们再想办法
Get back in here, we'll work this out.

762
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:44,092
你知道我不能回去的
I can't, you know that.

763
00:42:44,092 --> 00:42:46,018
如果你是清白的  你就可以回来

764
00:42:46,025 --> 00:42:47,057
他们这样陷害我  而不杀我
Look, there is a reason why they

765
00:42:47,057 --> 00:42:49,005
其中定有隐情
wanted me framed and didn't kill me

766
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:51,019
这样就能利用我来让你分心
They're trying to keep you distracted by dealing with me

767
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:52,086
他们好趁机继续不可告人的秘密
So they can finish what they started.

768
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:54,046
别让他们侥幸成功
Don't let them get away with this.

769
00:42:54,052 --> 00:42:55,079
恐怖袭击还没有结束
This threat is not over.

770
00:42:56,093 --> 00:42:58,016
杰克
Jack...

771
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:02,067
杰克
Jack?!

772
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,037
