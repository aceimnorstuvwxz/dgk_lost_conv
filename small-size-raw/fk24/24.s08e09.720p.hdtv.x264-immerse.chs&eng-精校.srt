Previously on 24

4
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,013
蕾妮
Renee.

5
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:20,023
瓦德米尔先攻击你  你是自卫
Vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself.

6
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:21,055
事情就是这样
That's what happened.

7
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:22,031
要这样说吗
I don't know.

8
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:24,080
我来证明  如果有其他任何人质疑这一点
I do, and if anybody else wants to ask you questions about that,

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,048
我会和你站在一起回答他们
I'll be right there with you to answer them.

10
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,057
你暗示了我一些丹娜的事情
You implied something about Dana.

11
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:29,046
我想知道是什么事
I wanna know what it is.

12
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:32,063
我想她去见了某个男人
I think she went to meet some guy.

13
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,090
看一下这个
Take a look at this.

14
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:35,013
你觉得你能找到她吗
You think you can find her?

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,070
你答应过我  为你办完此事
You promise me I do this one thing for you,

16
00:00:38,073 --> 00:00:40,063
你就不再来烦我了
and then you'll leave me alone.

17
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,060
那是不可能的
That's not gonna happen.

18
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:44,086
我们这次可是开门红啊
This is a sweet operation that we got going here.

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,063
知道吗  你搞到密码  然后我们下手
You know? You getting the access codes, and us pulling the jobs.

20
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:49,030
你不能这样对我  卡文
You can't do this to me, Kevin.

21
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:56,010
你知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

22
00:00:57,017 --> 00:01:00,003
我只知道俄国帮派中有一个很有势力的人
All I know is that there's a very powerful man in the Russian Syndicate

23
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:01,050
有能耐贩卖武器级别的铀
who's been trafficking weapons-grade uranium.

24
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:02,043
你为谁卖命
Who do you work for?

25
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,003
我无权告诉你
I'm not at liberty to say.

26
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,069
迪米特里  给他点颜色看看
Dmitri, work on him,

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,013
直到他准备如实招供
until he's ready to tell us everything.

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,066
一切都结束了  你很清楚  对吧
It's over, you know that, right?

29
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:24,026
你想知道浓缩铀棒的下落吗
You want to know where the rods are?

30
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,053
我会告诉你的
I will tell you.

31
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,033
但我得得到完全豁免
But I want full immunity.

32
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:34,006
阿曼达  你看到了吗
Amanda, are you seeing this?

33
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,070
浓缩铀棒在哪里
Where the hell are the rods?

34
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:37,090
我们检测出有放射性微粒的迹象
We've picked up trace radiation signatures.

35
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:38,083
浓缩铀棒曾放在这里
The rods were here.

36
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:41,020
我告诉你了  浓缩铀棒在那里
I told you, they were there.

37
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:42,096
我派了两个手下看守它们
I had two of my men guarding them.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,040
我们发现了他们的尸体  都被枪杀了
We found their bodies; both shot.

39
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:47,063
我不确定是否该信你  约瑟夫
I wasn't sure I believed, Josef,

40
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,000
你连自己老子都敢出卖
that you would betray your father.

41
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,023
你因他拖延交货时间而惴惴不安
You were upset that he was holding up delivery of the rods.

42
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:52,036
现在我会把它们交给你
Now I've gotten them for you.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,063
你什么时候能过来
When will you get here?

44
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,073
五分钟之内
Less than five minutes.

45
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:56,090
只管把我的钱准备好
Just have my money ready.

46
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:07,051
以下事件发生于凌晨十二点至一点间
The following takes place between 12:00 A.M. and 1:00 A.M.

克洛伊  我是杰克
Chloe, it's Jack.

55
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,093
-黑斯廷斯在吗  -是的
- Do you have Hastings there? - Yes.

56
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:57,003
-你准备好追踪这个电话了吗  -准备好了
- Are you ready to trace the call? - We're ready.

57
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:58,031
巴扎耶夫只要跟他的儿子接通电话
As soon as Bazhaev gets his son on the phone,

58
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,060
我们就开始对其进行三角定位
we can begin to triangulate.

59
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,067
好的  别挂
Okay, hold on.

60
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:12,089
法哈德  你在哪  你迟到了
Farhad, where are you? You're late.

61
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,089
约瑟夫  是我  你爸爸
Josef, it's me, your father.

62
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,049
不要挂断电话
Don't hang up. Stay on the line.

63
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:17,072
千万不要
Please.

64
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:19,052
我知道浓缩铀棒在你手里
I know you have the rods.

65
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:20,072
是的
Yes.

66
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,042
我就是想让你知道
I wanted you to know.

67
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:24,035
警察也知道了  他们在这里
The police know, too. They're here.

68
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,019
你告诉警察了吗
You told the police?

69
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:27,055
当然没有
Of course not.

70
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:29,074
是瓦德米尔的那个买主  他是联邦探员
It was Vladimir's buyer-- he's a Federal agent.

71
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,099
约瑟夫  实不相瞒
Josef, just so we're up front,

72
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,012
我和你父亲在一起
I'm here with your father.

73
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:34,005
我叫杰克·鲍尔  反恐组探员
My name is Jack Bauer; I work with CTU.

74
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:37,025
你们怎么对付他都行  我不在乎
Well, do what you want with him; I don't care.

75
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:41,025
可能你不在乎他  但是他在乎你
Maybe you don't-- but your father cares about you.

76
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:42,093
他跟我们商量能否赦免你
He negotiated immunity for you.

77
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:45,037
你只要把浓缩铀棒交给我们
All you need to do is bring the fuel rods in,

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,037
其他的事都不用你操心
and you can put the rest of this behind you.

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,080
这是保障你安全的唯一办法
It's the only way you'll be safe.

80
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:52,001
安全  我父亲告诉你我弟弟的事情了吗
Safe? Did my father tell you about my other brother?

81
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,045
他如何对待我弟弟的
What he did to him?

82
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:54,060
欧力格快要死了  你知道的
Oleg was dying; you know that.

83
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:56,020
是啊  我们本可以救他
Yeah, we could have saved him.

84
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,068
要不是为了你的宝贝交易  他现在还活着呢
He would be alive if not for your precious deal.

85
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,082
是的  也许是这样  我不知道
You are right, maybe you are right, I don't know,

86
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:03,067
但是... 人死不能复生
but... that doesn't bring Oleg back,

87
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:06,032
而且我不能承受再失去一个儿子的痛苦了
and I cannot bear to lose another son.

88
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:07,025
我不用你担心
Don't worry about me.

89
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:09,012
-我很好  -不  你不会
- I'll be fine. - No, you won't be.

90
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,065
你不会成功的
You won't be anything.

91
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,098
一切都结束了
It's over.

92
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,045
联邦探员在这里
Federal agents are here

93
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,048
搜寻一切可能的线索
going through everything.

94
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:17,002
整个城市都进入了警戒状态
The entire city is under guard.

95
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,092
如果你不把浓缩铀棒交出来  他们会搜捕你
If you don't bring the rods in, they will hunt you down.

96
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,008
他们会杀了你的  约瑟夫
They will kill you, Josef.

97
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,014
我将无法保护你
I won't be able to protect you.

98
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,052
我不想看见你受到伤害
I don't want to see you hurt.

99
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:33,035
如果我把浓缩铀棒交出来
If I hand over the rods,

100
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:34,082
该怎么做呢
how does this work?

101
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:37,028
告诉我们你在哪里  我们会把你带回来
Tell us where you are, and we'll bring you in.

102
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:38,078
就这样吗
Oh, just like that?

103
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:40,032
我们以前的事就一笔勾销了吗
After everything we've done?

104
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:42,078
是的  我告诉你了  他们会赦免我们的
Yes, I told you-- they have given us immunity.

105
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,025
好吗  约瑟夫  求你了
Please, Josef, please.

106
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:49,038
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance.

107
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,042
你在听吗
Are you there?

108
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,012
是的  我在
Yes, I'm here.

109
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,055
你得马上把他带回来
You need to bring him in now,

110
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:57,052
要抢在法哈德赶到之前
before Farhad gets there.

111
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:59,008
约瑟夫  你听见了吗
Josef, did you hear that?

112
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,055
你得赶快离开
You need to move.

113
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,032
约瑟夫
Josef?

114
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:07,017
好吧  我这就过去
All right, I'm on my way.

115
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,087
我在路上给你打电话  告诉你见面的地点
I'll call you from the road to let you know where to meet me.

116
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,011
当心别打中浓缩铀棒
Careful with the rods.

117
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,098
听起来像是枪声
Sounded like shots fired.

118
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:17,028
你们得去救他
You need to help him!

119
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,018
他在哪
Where is he?!

120
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,035
不清楚
I don't know.

121
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:20,098
克洛伊  你确定他的位置了吗
Chloe, did you get a trace on that call?

122
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:22,068
不是很精确  不过他好像在
Not exactly, but it looks like he was

123
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,082
皇后区中部的法拉盛草地公园
in central Queens near Flushing Meadow Park.

124
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,068
马上派小组排查那个区域
I want units combing that area.

125
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:28,075
-杰克  把嫌犯带回反恐组  -了解
- Jack, bring your suspect back to CTU. - Copy that.

126
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:32,005
马上准备把他带走
Get him ready for transport now.

127
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:37,050
-他死了吗  -是的
- Is he dead? - Yes.

128
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,095
我们得抓紧时间
We need to hurry.

129
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:40,095
船在码头上等我们
The boat is waiting for us at the port.

130
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:42,009
去码头不是一个好主意
The port may not be the right thing.

131
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,085
什么意思
What do you mean?

132
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:45,015
当局已经知道我们的计划
The authorities know our plan.

133
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:47,035
我们需要一个新计划
We need a new one.

134
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:48,078
喂
Hey.

135
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,095
你在干什么  别碰那东西
What are you doing? Don't touch that.

136
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,025
你听到了吗
Did you get that?

137
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:57,005
是的  杰克
Yes, Jack.

138
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,008
我们在做声纹比对来确定他们的身份
We're trying to get an I.D. off the voice print.

139
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:01,012
目前还没有什么线索锁定方位
So far, no luck locking down a location.

140
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:04,015
明白  我们马上启程返回
Copy that. We're on our way back now.

141
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,005
抓紧时间  把浓缩铀棒装到车上
We need to hurry. Take the van and get the rods...

142
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,094
我们找到了跟最后说话这人吻合的声线
We've got a match for the voice at the end of the call--

143
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,055
是法哈德·哈桑
Farhad Hassan.

144
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,036
就是说他拿到了浓缩铀棒
So, he got his fuel rods.

145
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,000
-确定另一男子身份了吗  -没有  长官
- Any I.D. On the other man we heard? - No, sir.

146
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:27,036
黑斯廷斯先生  罗伯·维斯找你
Mr. Hastings, Rob Weiss for you.

147
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:30,066
告诉他  我马上过来
Tell him I'll be right with him.

148
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,046
告诉我巴扎耶夫预计到达的时间
Give me an ETA on Bazhaev.

149
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,030
-是  长官  -他一到这里就开始审讯
- Yes, sir. - Start the interrogation as soon as he gets here.

150
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,070
杰克  我是克罗伊
Jack, it's Chloe.

151
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,070
黑斯廷斯想知道你的预计到达时间
Hastings wants your ETA.

152
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,010
他想尽快审问巴扎耶夫
He's anxious to interrogate Bazhaev.

153
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:49,050
我还有十五分钟就到了
I'm about 15 minutes out.

154
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:51,026
但我不指望从他身上得到任何情报
But I wouldn't count on getting anything from him.

155
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,088
如果巴扎耶夫想告诉我
If Bazhaev could have told me

156
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:55,020
怎么抓住他的杀子仇人  他早告诉我了
how to get to the people that just killed his son, he would have.

157
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,020
杰克  我听说了你的遭遇
Jack, I heard about what you went through.

158
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,080
你还好吗
Are you okay?

159
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:03,090
嗯  我很好  谢谢
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

160
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,050
蕾妮怎么样了
How's Renee?

161
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,076
她很担心你
Pretty worried about you.

162
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,063
她还在医务室
They've still got her in medical.

163
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:12,070
你能帮我转接一下吗
Yeah. Could you patch me through to her?

164
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:13,080
等一下
Hold on.

165
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,056
好
Okay.

166
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,040
蕾妮  杰克要和你说话
Renee, I have Jack.

167
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:24,076
杰克
Jack.

168
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,020
你还好吗
How are you?

169
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:28,020
我很好  你呢
Uh, fine, I'm fine. What about you?

170
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:29,076
我们有浓缩铀棒的线索了
We had a line on the fuel rods.

171
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,056
但是线索又断了
We lost it.

172
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,008
那现在有何计划
So what's the plan now?

173
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,012
那还得黑斯廷斯说了算
It's Hastings' call.

174
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:38,013
我把犯人带回反恐小组  然后我就撤了
I'm bringing the prisoner back to CTU, then I'm out.

175
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,053
他们问你瓦德米尔的事了吗
They ask you about what happened, about Vladimir?

176
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:42,013
是的  克罗伊问了
Uh, yes, Chloe did.

177
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:43,040
是克罗伊做的任务简报吗
Chloe did the debrief?

178
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,052
对  其实...
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't...

179
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:47,008
也不能叫任务简报
I wouldn't really call it a debrief.

180
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,013
我们就是谈了谈
We talked, uh, mostly, and, uh,

181
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,006
然后我写了份笔录
then I wrote a statement.

182
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,080
你解释了你这是正当防卫吗
And you explained how you acted in self-defense?

183
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,090
是的  和我们说好的一样
Yes, like we agreed.

184
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,010
事情本就如此
That's how it happened.

185
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,043
蕾妮  你一定要一口咬定
Renee, you've got to stick with that.

186
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:59,013
好  我尽量吧
Yeah, yes, I'm gonna try.

187
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:01,030
我知道这难为你了
I know this is hard for you,

188
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,033
但你没做错任何事
but you did nothing wrong,

189
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:06,022
你一定要这么想
and you need to start believing that.

190
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,053
好吗
Okay?

191
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,080
好的
Okay.

192
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,053
杰克  我不知道该怎么开口
Jack, I don't... I don't know how to say this,

193
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:15,083
但是我要说  我想确定
so I'm just gonna say it, 'cause I need to make sure

194
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:17,066
我没有误会你的意思
that I'm not misunderstanding, but..

195
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,093
当你说我"还有你"时...
when you say that I "Have you"...

196
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:21,070
我就是这个意思
I meant it like it sounded.

197
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,006
我们现在怎么办呢
So now what do we do?

198
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,063
我们会想出办法的
We'll figure it out.

199
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,000
好吧
Okay.

200
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:32,010
我十五分钟后到
I'll be in in about 15 minutes.

201
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,063
再见
Bye.

202
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,056
-罗伯  我是布赖恩  -我刚从你办公室
- Rob, it's Brian. - I just got a flash from your office

203
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:53,076
得知总统批准的豁免权失效了
how this immunity situation the president authorized played out.

204
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,033
情况不妙  布赖恩
It's not good, Brian.

205
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,060
真的很不妙
Really not.

206
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,010
就我所知  巴扎耶夫之子抢在我们赶到前
Now, as I understand it, Bazhaev's son swiped the rods

207
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,043
把浓缩铀棒从他父亲那里偷走了
from his father before we got there.

208
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:01,033
是这样的
That's correct.

209
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,016
-现在他儿子已经死了  -是的
- And now the son is dead. - Yes.

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,083
我们知道浓缩铀棒现在落在谁手里吗
Do we know who has the rods now?

211
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,050
很显然  在法哈德·哈桑手里
Apparently, it's Farhad Hassan.

212
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:08,083
他在哪
And where is he?

213
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:11,046
-我们在找  -就是说你不知道他的去向
- We're looking. - Meaning you have no idea.

214
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,054
布赖恩  是我促成了总统重组反恐小组
Brian, I pushed the president to resurrect CTU

215
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,067
并让你全权负责
with you at the helm.

216
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:17,000
你现在告诉我你可以胜任  我就相信你
Now, you tell me you can do the job, I believe you.

217
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,000
我能胜任
I can do the job.

218
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:19,026
那就好
Good to hear it.

219
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,043
如果事情搞砸了
'Cause when things get this colossally screwed up,

220
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,093
总得找人当替罪羊
people look for someone to blame.

221
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,044
你想说什么
So what are you saying?

222
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:28,056
我希望那个人不是你
I'm saying I don't want that person to be you.

223
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,020
我让你坐上了这把交椅  你是我的人
I put you there; you're my guy.

224
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:33,013
如果你失败了  我也就完蛋了
If you fail, I fail.

225
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:35,040
这是绝对不能发生的
And that cannot happen.

226
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:37,083
现在我们达成共识了吗
Are we on the same page here?

227
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:40,053
你有什么建议
So what have you got in mind?

228
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,086
蕾妮·沃克
Renee Walker.

229
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:46,015
是她杀了可提供我们主要线索之人  对吧
She killed one of our main leads, isn't that correct?

230
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,042
他心理变态  她是在自卫
He was a psychopath,she was defending herself.

231
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,044
她捅了他十五次之多
She stabbed him 15 times.

232
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:52,011
你的意思是这是谋杀
What, are you saying it was murder?

233
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,045
我是说这该由律师去决定
I'm saying that's for lawyers to decide.

234
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,048
我们在谈论一个把个人生死置之度外的女人
We're talking about a woman who put her life on the line

235
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:57,063
她本不必这么做的
when she didn't have to.

236
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:59,040
这点她肯定占了便宜
I'm sure that will weigh in her favor.

237
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,096
你知道定罪意味着什么吗
You know what a conviction would mean--

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,034
她会蹲很多年大牢
she'd go away for years.

239
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,003
一定得有人背这个黑锅  布赖恩
Well, someone has to pay for this, Brian.

240
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:06,020
你告诉我  你认为应该是谁
so you tell me-- who do you want that to be?

241
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,077
我从司法部派了个人
I'm sending someone over from Justice.

242
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,010
克蕾丝丁·史密斯
A Kristin Smith.

243
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,013
她会负责这件事的
She'll take care of everything.

244
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:17,046
需要我做什么
What do you need from me?

245
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,000
别碍手碍脚  就万事大吉了
Just open the door and get out of the way.

246
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:34,061
我们做了地毯式搜查  长官
We did a sweep, sir.

247
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,048
没有任何危险物质的迹象
No trace of any hazardous materials.

248
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,088
-好吧  完成了就回基地  -是  长官
- Fine. Finish up, get back to base.  - Yes, sir.

249
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:44,060
阿洛
Arlo?

250
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,087
我在
Yeah.

251
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,047
-找到丹娜了吗  -是的
- Find Dana yet?  - I think so.

252
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,060
我追踪了她手机的GPS坐标
I'm tracking the GPS coordinates off her phone.

253
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:51,043
好  发到我的掌上电脑上
All right, send them to my PDA.

254
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:52,059
你确定这是一个好主意吗  
Are you sure that's a good idea?

255
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,024
我的意思是  说不定她这么做会有合理解释的
I mean, there could be a reasonable explanation why she's...

256
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,073
是你多管闲事在先
Hey, you're the one who stuck his nose in all this.

257
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:57,093
就这么做
Just do it.

258
00:10:58,036 --> 00:10:59,029
好吧
Okay.

259
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,077
坐标发到你的手机上了
Coordinates are on your phone.

260
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,090
谢谢
Thanks.

261
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:04,047
我让所有人都回反恐小组了
Look, I'm sending everyone back to CTU.

262
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,093
你准备怎么做
What are you going to do?

263
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,017
我一小时内赶到
I'll be there within the hour.

264
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:10,030
就告诉他我去追踪一条线索了
just tell him I'm following up a lead.

265
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,020
我知道丹娜对你来说很重要
Look, I know Dana means a lot to you,

266
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:14,063
但你认为这真值得你擅离职守吗
but do you really think this is worth going AWOL over?

267
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,060
她是我的未婚妻  阿洛
She's my fiancee, Arlo.

268
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,057
吉姆  我要用你的车
Jim, I'm taking your vehicle.

269
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,013
去找欧文  让他把反恐特警组带回反恐小组
Find Owen, have him take SWAT back to CTU.

270
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:29,057
告诉他我也马上回去
Say I'll be right behind them.

271
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,003
没问题  长官
No problem, sir.

272
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,060
丹娜回来了吗
Is Dana back yet?

273
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,090
她还没回来  长官
I don't think so, sir.

274
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,037
你找她有什么事吗
Do you need her for something?

275
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:51,007
找她有什么事
Do I need her for something?

276
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,029
废话  阿洛
Yes, Arlo,

277
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,093
她是我的首席数据分析员
she's my chief data analyst.

278
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:56,017
我要她做好她的本职工作
I need her to do her job.

279
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,067
追查她的去向  找到后告诉我
You track her down, and you let me know when you find her.

280
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,067
黑斯廷斯先生
Mr. Hastings,

281
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,066
司法部的克蕾丝丁·史密斯来见你了
Kristin Smith from the Justice Department is here to see you.

282
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,000
谢谢
Thank you.

283
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,067
史密斯女士
Ms. Smith.

284
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,087
黑斯廷斯先生
Mr. Hastings.

285
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,041
罗伯·维斯给你说明情况了吗
Did Rob Weiss brief you?

286
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,067
是的  我还得找蕾妮·沃克谈谈
He did. I have to interview a Renee Walker.

287
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,080
我在来的路上看了她的笔录
I read her statement on the way over.

288
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,063
在你看来她谋杀罪名成立吗
Did it appear to you that she's guilty of murder?

289
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,090
维斯先生提醒过我你可能对此事存有异议
Mr. Weiss warned me you might have issues with this.

290
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:28,037
要让一个为国尽忠的女人背黑锅吗
With hanging a brave woman out to dry?

291
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,027
是的  我的确不认同
Yes, I do.

292
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:32,053
但她的笔录和鉴证科证据之间存在很大出入
There are major discrepancies between her statement and the forensic evidence.

293
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:34,006
我要她做的
All I'm asking her to do

294
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:35,078
只是解释清楚笔录中的疑点
is to set the record straight.

295
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:40,039
谨慎起见
I feel it would be prudent

296
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,068
对这次谈话要限制使用监视器
to restrict surveillance access to this interview.

297
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:45,025
-好  -但出于法律程序
- Fine. - But I would also like a video record of it

298
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,027
我想还是要录像
in the event of legal proceedings.

299
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,080
这要求不算过分吧
Can I ask you to provide that?

300
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,063
好吧  这边走  请
Yes. Right this way, please.

301
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,087
这是你的笔录报告
This is a transcript of your statement.

302
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:07,058
重新检查一遍再签名
You should review it before you sign it.

303
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:11,008
杰克刚说他还要多久到
How far out did Jack say he was?

304
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:12,004
十五分钟
15 minutes.

305
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,090
这是司法部来的克蕾斯丁·史密斯
This is Kristin Smith from Justice.

306
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:17,037
她要和蕾妮谈谈
She needs to talk to Renee,

307
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:18,087
你能回避一下吗  克罗伊
so if you'll excuse us, Chloe.

308
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,013
和她谈什么
Talk to her about what?

309
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:21,023
克罗伊  你可以离开了
Now, Chloe.

310
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:30,023
谢谢  黑斯廷斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

311
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,091
她要谈什么
What is she talking to her about?

312
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,014
她刚正要在笔录上签字
She was about to sign her statement.

313
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:41,017
我已经给她做完任务简报了
I already debriefed her.

314
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,013
克蕾丝丁需要搞清楚一些细节
Kristin just needs to fill in a few details.

315
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:44,027
我已经详加记录了
I already filled in the details.

316
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,030
我知道你是在保护蕾妮
I know that you are protective of Renee.

317
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:47,004
这点我尊重你
I respect that.

318
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:48,063
那就让我也参与谈话
Then let me sit in on the interview.

319
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,073
为什么
Why?

320
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:52,083
因为你的简报中有不实成分吗
Was your debrief not a full and honest statement of the facts?

321
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,033
我们对付的是持有核原料的恐怖分子
We have nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists.

322
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:58,062
现在  我要你集中精神回去工作
Now, I need you back at your desk focused on that.

323
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,037
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

324
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,027
这是哪
What is this place?

325
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,085
集结待命区
A staging area.

326
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:19,060
是一个支持我们行动的商人的地盘
It belongs to a businessman who supports our cause.

327
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:21,017
我不想拖太久
I don't want to delay too long.

328
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,097
我们得再找个办法
We need to find another way

329
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,027
把这些浓缩铀棒运出美国
to get the nuclear rods out of the country.

330
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,097
你听到过美国人是怎么对巴扎耶夫儿子说的
You heard what the American said to Bazhaev's son.

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,067
他们已经知道我们的意图了
They already know what we're trying to do.

332
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,057
所以我们得快马加鞭
Which is why we need to move quickly.

333
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,003
美国人可不是傻子  法哈德
The Americans are not stupid, Farhad.

334
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:38,005
如果我们现在靠近任何机场或者港口
If we go near any airfield or harbor now,

335
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,063
放射性探测器就会发现我们
the radiological detectors will spot us.

336
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:12,099
这些人是谁  萨米尔
Who are these men, Samir?

337
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:15,035
这些人是我雇的  自己人
These are men I have recruited. Our men.

338
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,055
他们在这干什么
What are they doing here?

339
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:18,036
把浓缩铀棒卸下车
They're going to unload the rods.

340
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:20,006
我们得处理掉这辆货车
We need to get rid of the van.

341
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,006
然后呢
And then what?

342
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,056
你得休息下
You should rest.

343
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:24,099
我不需要休息
I don't need to rest.

344
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:26,089
我要知道我们是在干什么
I need to know what we're doing.

345
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:35,082
我们不可能把浓缩铀棒运出美国
We can't get the rods out of the country.

346
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:36,086
那么干脆就地解决它们
So let's use them.

347
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,062
就地解决  怎么解决
Use them? How?

348
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,099
用作武器
As a weapon.

349
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,012
来一次核爆
A radiological bomb.

350
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:46,007
我们要给美国人点颜色看看
We'll show the Americans how strong we are.

351
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:49,074
给他们点颜色看看
Show them how strong we are?

352
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,096
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

353
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:55,008
如果我们用浓缩铀棒对付美国人
If we use the rods against the Americans,

354
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:57,012
他们会踏平我们的国家
they will destroy our country.

355
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,049
轰炸我们的家园  侵占我们的领土
They'll bomb us, invade.

356
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,082
就算什么也不做  他们也照样会侵犯我们
And if we do nothing, they'll invade us anyway.

357
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:06,079
这就是你哥哥那个狗屁和平条约的主旨
That's what this peace treaty with your brother is all about.

358
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:09,063
他们想把我们变成
They're trying to turn us into another corrupt,

359
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:11,084
在你哥哥独裁之下
Mid-East regime with your brother as dictator,

360
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:13,089
在美国人武器和金钱淫威之下的
kept in power by American guns

361
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:15,082
又一个中东傀儡政权
and money.

362
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:19,026
这难道不是我们联合起来反抗的原因吗
Isn't that what we came together to prevent?

363
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:31,009
没有其他办法了吗
Is there no other way?

364
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:35,066
美国永远是我们的敌人
America will always be our enemy.

365
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:39,099
记住  我的朋友
Remember, my friend--

366
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:45,012
千里之堤也能溃于蚁穴
even a giant can be toppled by a single stone.

367
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:52,059
得让他们知道我们不是好惹的
We need to make them fear us.

368
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:03,086
那算我一个吧
Then I'm with you.

369
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,018
你在笔录里说
So you said in your statement

370
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:45,088
出于自卫才杀死瓦德米尔
that you killed Vladimir Laitanan in self-defense.

371
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,045
是这样吗
Is that correct?

372
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:49,035
是的  我如实记录了
Yes, that's why it's in my statement.

373
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:51,061
我在你的笔录里没有看到
What I didn't see in the statement

374
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:54,015
任何关于你和瓦德米尔的过去
was any mention of your history with Laitanan.

375
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:56,021
你和他确实有过一段历史
You did have a history with him.

376
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:59,058
六年前在联邦调查局的行动中我做过卧底
I worked an undercover operation with the FBI six years ago.

377
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:00,085
瓦德米尔·勒塔纳就是目标
Vladimir Laitanan was the target.

378
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:02,091
那次行动的过程中
And during the course of that operation,

379
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:05,011
你必须接近他
you had to get close to him.

380
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,038
他对你着迷
He became obsessed with you.

381
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,038
试图强奸你
He tried to rape you.

382
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,048
是的
Yes.

383
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,065
但你设法阻止了他
But you were able to stop him.

384
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,051
我反抗了
I fought him.

385
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:17,015
断了两根肋骨被送进了医院
Put me in the hospital with two broken ribs.

386
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:18,075
我想档案里也有
I'm sure that's in there, too.

387
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:21,083
你能反抗一个强壮而极度暴力的男人
You were able to fight off a stronger, violent man.

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,061
真让人刮目相看
It's impressive.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,089
但这次他攻击你的时候
But this time when he attacked you,

390
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:29,063
你没有反抗他
you didn't fight him off.

391
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:31,045
我不能
I couldn't.

392
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:34,038
他掐住了我的脖子  想要勒死我
He had his hands around my neck trying to strangle me.

393
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,024
我明白
I understand.

394
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:40,001
你当时认为他会杀了你
You thought he was going to kill you.

395
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,065
你的生命受到了威胁
You were in fear for your life.

396
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,058
然后发生了什么
So what happened next?

397
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:55,031
他快让我窒息了
He was choking me.

398
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:57,038
我抓到了把刀就捅了他
I grabbed the knife and I stabbed him.

399
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,035
出于自卫吗
In self-defense?

400
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:00,040
是的
Yes.

401
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:07,021
你出于自卫捅了他... 十五次
You stabbed him in self-defense... 15 times.

402
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:10,044
十五次啊
15 times.

403
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,070
捅第一刀就能阻止他  
The first blow alone could have stopped him,

404
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:15,095
可你却没有停手
but you didn't stop.

405
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:21,055
看着我  蕾妮
Look at me, Renee.

406
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:26,025
你是前联邦调查局的探员
You were an investigator for the FBI.

407
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:28,035
大家一致认为  你是最好的探员之一
By all accounts, one of the best they had.

408
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:31,042
你站在我这个角度来看这件事
Put yourself on my side of the table.

409
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:33,034
看看我看到的是什么
Look at what I'm looking at.

410
00:20:34,054 --> 00:20:35,096
有人丧命了
There's a dead body.

411
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,095
我一方面有你的笔录说你是正当防卫
On the one hand, I have your statement saying you acted in self-defense.

412
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,095
可另一方面  我也有这些
On the other, I have these.

413
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:46,029
证据表明  是你一怒之下把他乱刀捅死
Evidence of a sustained and furious assault

414
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:48,053
杀人意图非常明确
with clear intent to kill.

415
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,057
作为前联邦探员
Now as an investigator,

416
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:53,035
你自己心里有数  对吗
you know which version is true, don't you?

417
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:57,061
我就是在正当防卫
I acted in self-defense.

418
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:04,081
我说一下我的想法
Let me tell you what I think happened.

419
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:08,056
你不顾后果地利用了这次至关重要的行动
You used an operation of unparalleled importance

420
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:12,098
来向行动目标寻仇
to seek revenge against a target without any regard for the final outcome.

421
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,075
我告诉你了  是他先袭击我的
I'm telling you, he attacked me first.

422
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:17,069
沃克女士  我了解你为国效力所做出的牺牲
Ms. Walker, I'm well aware of your sacrifice in service to this country,

423
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:20,061
不过我认为
but I do not think

424
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:23,082
这个黑锅不该由反恐组来替你背
that it is fair or right that CTU should be taken down

425
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,066
只因你以公谋私  
because you used this operation

426
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:28,056
报一己之私怨
to seek out your own personal vendetta against Vladimir Laitanan.

427
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,031
我看过你的档案
I looked at your file.

428
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,079
这不是你第一次失去理智了
This isn't the first time you lost control.

429
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:40,036
你上一次差一点杀了阿兰·威尔逊
You almost killed Alan Wilson.

430
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,021
就因为这个你才被联调局解雇的  对吗
That's why you got fired by the FBI, isn't it?

431
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,003
是的
Yes.

432
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:55,061
我看得出这对你影响有多大  蕾妮
I can see what this is doing to you, Renee.

433
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:58,065
它让你内心几近崩溃
It is tearing you up inside.

434
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:03,018
交代了吧  告诉我真相
Let it out. Tell me the truth.

435
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,008
你不能容忍瓦德米尔再碰你
You killed Vladimir Laitanan because the thought of him

436
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:08,047
所以你杀了他
touching you again was intolerable.

437
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:13,021
承认吧
Do the right thing here.

438
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:17,035
这就是真相  对吗  蕾妮
That's what happened, isn't it, Renee?

439
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:29,055
对吗  蕾妮
Is that right, Renee?

440
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:45,055
不准打电话  切断通讯
No phone calls. No communication.

441
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:46,085
我想看看我儿子的尸体
I would like to see my son's body.

442
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:49,011
我们还没找到呢
We haven't found him yet.

443
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,088
-怎么了  -我一直试着在联系你
- What's wrong? - I've been trying to reach you.

444
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:53,018
蕾妮有麻烦了  她被重新审问了
It's about Renee. She's being questioned again.

445
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:54,078
你不是说你给她做完任务简报了吗
I thought you said you already completed the debrief.

446
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,008
是啊  不过这次是黑斯廷斯的命令
I did. Hastings ordered it.

447
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:58,065
他从司法部叫了个女的来
He called in some woman from the Justice Department.

448
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:00,031
蕾妮现在在哪
Where's Renee now?

449
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:02,021
她在医务室
She's in medical.

450
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,043
有那房间的监控录像吗
Can you get eyes in that room?

451
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:06,038
不行  他切断了所有监控
No. He cut off all access.

452
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,071
出什么问题了
What is going on?

453
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:10,051
他们想陷害她来当这次行动失败的替罪羊
They're setting her up to take the fall for the failure of this mission.

454
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:28,085
抱歉  先生  任何人不准...
Sorry, sir. No one's...

455
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,078
这是他们的圈套  什么也别说
They're setting you up. Don't say another word.

456
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:39,061
太晚了
It's too late.

457
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:41,025
你想干什么  出去
What do you think you're doing? Get out of here now.

458
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,038
你好大的胆子
How dare you?

459
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:47,058
她牺牲了一切
After everything she sacrificed.

460
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:49,071
也失去了一切
After everything she's lost.

461
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:51,024
你要不要脸
Have you no decency?

462
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:52,015
杰克
Jack.

463
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,035
审问结束了
This is over.

464
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:00,021
举起手来
Hands in the air.

465
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:01,016
照做
Do it now!

466
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,008
孩子  你最好放下枪
Son, you better put that down

467
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:05,095
不然你会受伤的
or you're going to get hurt.

468
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,028
没事的
It's all right.

469
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,009
走
Go.

470
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:17,011
举起手来  女士
Ma'am, hands in the air.

471
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:36,052
你手上有没有把浓缩铀棒改造成核弹的资源吗
Do you have what you need to turn the rods into a bomb?

472
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:40,045
我们正收集材料
We're gathering materials.

473
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,065
在这么短的时间里
Must be difficult

474
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:43,095
一定很难办吧
at such short notice.

475
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:48,081
爆炸物  不难搞  至于引爆器...
Explosives, no. Detonator?

476
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:49,095
我们正在想办法
We're working on it.

477
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:54,021
我认识一个人
I might know somebody.

478
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,031
是个城里的教授
A professor in the city.

479
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:58,068
他精通电子学
With expertise in electronics.

480
00:24:58,071 --> 00:24:59,098
他信得过吗
You sure he can be trusted?

481
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,015
信得过
Yes.

482
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:02,058
他会帮忙的
He will help.

483
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:04,048
他对我言听计从
He will do whatever I ask.

484
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,002
但是...
But still...

485
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:09,078
我还得谨慎行事
I will bring this up very carefully.

486
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:12,028
我需要和他单独谈谈
I need to talk to him in private.

487
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:16,008
好的
Very well.

488
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:17,025
办公室里有部电话
There's a phone in the office.

489
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,055
阿里会带你去
Ali will take you.

490
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:48,091
攻击目标确定了吗
What is the target? Is that decided?

491
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:54,068
纽约的目标太多了
So many targets in New York.

492
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:56,068
难以取舍
It will be hard to choose.

493
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:12,028
萨米尔  快过来
Samir! Over here!

494
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,018
法哈德逃跑了
It was Farhad. He escaped.

495
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,022
找到他
Find him!

496
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:35,008
马上
Now!

497
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,071
解开手铐
Cuffs off.

498
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,026
让我们单独谈谈
Give us the room.

499
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:04,087
-坐下  杰克  -我站着
- Sit down, Jack. - I'll stand.

500
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:08,012
这就是新的反恐组  你一手遮天是吗
So, this is the new CTU-- you hang your own.

501
00:27:08,015 --> 00:27:09,033
如果你指蕾妮·沃克的事
If you mean Renee Walker,

502
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:10,061
我们只是问她几个问题而已
we're just asking some questions.

503
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,065
标准程序
Standard procedure.

504
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:14,007
标准程序是做任务简报  这个克罗伊已做完了
Standard procedure is a debrief, which Chloe completed.

505
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,045
但你却从司法部找来个玩弄权术的角色
But instead, you've got some hack from Justice in there

506
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:18,042
企图提起刑事诉讼
trying to initiate a criminal prosecution.

507
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:19,065
我们只是想弄清事实
We're just trying to establish the facts.

508
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,022
你是想找人给你顶罪吧
You're trying to save your ass.

509
00:27:23,056 --> 00:27:25,076
你求她帮忙时我也在场
I was there when you asked her for her help.

510
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,066
她答应了  我们也达到了目的
And she gave it to you, and we acquired the target.

511
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:32,006
你就这样回报她吗
And this is how you pay her back.

512
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:33,099
我不会让你得逞
I'm not going to let you do this.

513
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:36,003
我会先给白宫打电话
I'll call the White House first.

514
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:37,079
白宫早已获悉
The White House knows.

515
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,053
就是罗伯·维斯把那个女人派来的
Rob Weiss sent that woman over here.

516
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:40,076
抱歉  我可能没说清楚
Sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear.

517
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,006
我是说我直接打给总统
I meant I'd call the president.

518
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:45,014
因为我认为总统对谋杀案向来不手软
because I think the president takes murder pretty seriously.

519
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:49,023
记得吗  她亲手把自己女儿送上法庭
My recollection? She prosecuted her own daughter.

520
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:54,010
现在  乖乖给我坐下
Now, I'm not asking. Sit down.

521
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,049
抱歉打扰一下
Sorry to interrupt.

522
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,086
-我们很忙  克罗伊  -我也不想打扰
- We're busy, Chloe. - I don't mean to intrude,

523
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,091
可法哈德·哈桑来电话了
but I've got Farhad Hassan on the line.

524
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:11,096
法哈德·哈桑
Farhad Hassan?

525
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:13,086
我本也不信  但是声音相符
I didn't believe it, either, but the voice prints match.

526
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:15,046
你能搞清他在哪吗
Can you tell where he is?

527
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,056
不能  他用的是安全线路
No. He's on a secure line.

528
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,076
要我接通他吗
Can I just put him through?

529
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:24,015
哈桑先生
Mr. Hassan.

530
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:26,065
我是布赖恩·黑斯廷斯  反恐组主管
This is Brian Hastings, director of CTU.

531
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:28,088
有人在追杀我
There are people chasing me.

532
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:30,029
他们手上持有你们要找的浓缩铀棒
They have the rods you're looking for.

533
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:31,072
浓缩铀棒不是在你手里吗
I thought you had the rods.

534
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:33,049
不  已经不在我手里了
No. No more.

535
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:34,079
他们出尔反尔
They turned against me.

536
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:36,002
他们另有所图
They have their own plan--

537
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,029
打算袭击纽约
an attack on New York.

538
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,005
袭击纽约
An attack on New York?

539
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,015
告诉我确切时间
When, exactly?

540
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,049
很快
Soon.

541
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,039
很快就开始了
Very soon.

542
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:43,055
这些人是何方神圣
Who are these people?

543
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,059
他们是伊斯兰共和国活动于美国本土的特工
They are IRK operatives working in this country.

544
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:47,005
告诉我名字
Okay, I need names.

545
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:49,039
快救我出去
Just get me out of here.

546
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:51,059
我会告诉你一切真相
I'll tell you everything I know.

547
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,009
我们会救你出来的  哈桑先生
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan.

548
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:55,012
我说话算话  告诉我你现在在哪
I give you my word. Now, where are you?

549
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:57,062
森林山
Forest Hills.

550
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,095
这里有点像船舶仓库
Uh, some kind of boat warehouse.

551
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:03,039
赶快  我受伤了
Hurry. I'm injured.

552
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,052
他们在追杀我
They're hunting me.

553
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:06,025
别挂电话
Hold on and keep this line open.

554
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:07,077
需要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

555
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:09,054
查出他的位置  叫科尔来
Pinpoint his location and get me Cole.

556
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:11,018
-我找不到他  -找不到他是什么意思
- I can't. - What do you mean, you can't?

557
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:13,025
他的小队回来了  但他没回来
His team came back. He didn't.

558
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:15,045
欧文说他在追查一条线索
Owen said he was following a lead.

559
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:16,079
好吧  把欧文给我找来
All right, fine. Get me Owen.

560
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:17,092
告诉他  由他来领队行动
Tell him he's going to be leading the team.

561
00:29:17,095 --> 00:29:18,092
欧文  你有没搞错
Owen? Are you sure?

562
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,062
叫你去就去  克罗伊
Just do it, Chloe.

563
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,088
我的人会带你下楼并办好出门手续
They're going to take you down and process you.

564
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:32,015
我希望你马上从这里消失
I want you out of this building.

565
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,076
好吧
Fine.

566
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:04,035
别这样
Hey, hey, come on.

567
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,059
别急着走呀  急什么
What's the hurry? What's the hurry?

568
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:08,045
你还问急什么  你朋友是整一个变态
What's the hurry? Your friend's a total freak show.

569
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:10,012
我知道  但是别这样好吗
I know, but come on.

570
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:12,009
别走  我会补偿你们的
Don't go. I'll make it up to you.

571
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:13,072
好吗  别这样
Okay? Come on.

572
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,015
至少让我送你们一程吧
At least let me give you a ride back into town.

573
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,035
我们自己走
We'll walk.

574
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:19,061
晚安  女士们
Night, ladies!

575
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:27,039
我去撒泡尿
Gonna take a leak.

576
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,034
去吧
All right.

577
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:10,001
科尔  你来这干嘛
Cole, what are you doing here?

578
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,029
你还好意思问  我们正忙得不可开交
You're asking me that? We're in the middle of an operation,

579
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:13,092
丹娜  你不能擅离职守
Dana. You can't just abandon your post.

580
00:31:13,095 --> 00:31:15,055
听我解释
I can explain.

581
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,002
你可以一会再解释
You can explain later.

582
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,088
现在我必须把你送回反恐组
Right now, I'm taking you back to CTU.

583
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:22,005
我们的私事等核原料危机解除后再说
We can deal with our personal problems after we've secured the nuclear materials.

584
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:23,005
这不是你想的那样
It's not what you think.

585
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:24,065
是吗  那我是怎么想的
Yeah? What do I think?

586
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:26,015
我没和他上床
I am not sleeping with him.

587
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,088
省省吧  我都看到照片了
Save it. I saw the pictures.

588
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:29,022
什么照片
What pictures?

589
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:30,025
上车
Just get in.

590
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:32,059
-我不走  -为什么不走
- I am not leaving! - Why the hell not?

591
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:34,081
因为如果我离开了  这事就没完没了了
Because if I leave, this will never end.

592
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:36,051
什么没完没了
What will never end?

593
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,032
你不会明白的
You do not understand.

594
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,019
那就让我明白  见鬼
Then make me understand, damn it!

595
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,059
恐怕不行
I don't think that I can.

596
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:42,069
试试看
Try.

597
00:31:48,002 --> 00:31:49,003
好吧
Okay.

598
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:16,098
时间紧迫
We don't have a lot of time.

599
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,018
所以你最好快说
So you better start talking.

600
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:24,041
我的名字不叫丹娜·沃什
My name is not Dana Walsh.

601
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:28,045
我叫珍妮·斯科特
It's Jenny Scott.

602
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:52,053
说
Yes?

603
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:53,053
找到法哈德了吗
You find Farhad?

604
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,056
还在找
Still looking.

605
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,060
他受了重伤
I injured him badly.

606
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:57,080
跑不远
He won't get far.

607
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,070
我们不知道他可能与谁联系过
We don't know who he might have contacted.

608
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:02,006
我会把浓缩铀棒运送到安全的地方
I'll be traveling with the rods to a secure location.

609
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,036
要我来吗
Do you want me to come in?

610
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,036
不用
No.

611
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,028
你留下  
You stay here,

612
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:07,036
把他找出来
and you find him.

613
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,085
森林山一带有占地六英亩的复合体仓库
It's a six-acre warehouse complex in Forest Hills.

614
00:33:28,085 --> 00:33:31,050
法哈德就在其中一座仓库里
Farhad is somewhere in one of these buildings.

615
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:33,000
浓缩铀棒肯定也在那
The rods must be there, too.

616
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:34,023
虽然我们空中有无人机监控
Drones are airborne,

617
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:35,095
不过它们将无法再监控十二分钟
but they won't have eyes for another 12 minutes.

618
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:36,099
那警力方面呢
What about the police?

619
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,038
他们正在重新调度警力
They're redirecting their resources,

620
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:39,035
但这是很大一块区域
but it's a big area--

621
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:40,084
要警戒该区域得花点时间
it's gonna take a while to cordon off.

622
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,096
黑斯廷斯主管  您找我吗  长官
Director Hastings. You wanted to see me, sir?

623
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:45,064
鉴于奥迪斯探员不在
In the absence of Agent Ortiz,

624
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,096
我想你已准备好负责此次行动了
I assume you're ready to take charge of the operation.

625
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,045
是的  长官  有三个小队待命
Yes, sir. Three units standing by.

626
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:50,052
好  我带你出去
All right. I'll walk you out.

627
00:33:50,052 --> 00:33:52,026
你肩头的担子可不轻啊  欧文探员
There's a lot of pressure on you, Agent Owen.

628
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:53,063
我能处理好  长官
Oh, I can handle it, sir.

629
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:55,035
好  跟我说说  截击敌人的对策
All right, talk me through it. What's the attack grid?

630
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:56,067
理论上  
Our working theory's that

631
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,020
核原料应该还在法哈德附近
the nuclear materials are still in the proximity of Farhad.

632
00:33:59,023 --> 00:34:00,060
A小队和B小队的任务是
Teams Alpha and Bravo are tasked

633
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:02,010
锁定并解除浓缩铀棒的威胁
with locating and securing the rods.

634
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:03,040
C小队的任务呢
What about Team Charlie?

635
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,050
他们负责掩护撤离  长官
They're responsible for the actual evac, sir.

636
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:07,023
这是标准的城市搜救行动流程
It's a standard urban search-and-rescue--

637
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:08,056
速战速决
we're in, we're out.

638
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,093
果然很"标准"
Nothing standard about it.

639
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,037
等在这
Wait here.

640
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,083
杰克
Jack.

641
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,022
杰克
Jack.

642
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,016
你有话就说
You've got something to say, say it.

643
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,030
你好好想想  追杀法哈德那帮人
Think about it. The people that are chasing Farhad

644
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,054
已经知道他们的安全已成问题
already know they've got a big security problem,

645
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:29,063
所以很可能你的人赶到那里时
so most likely by the time your men get there,

646
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:31,030
浓缩铀棒早就消失得无影无踪了
those fuel rods will be long gone.

647
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:33,046
而你只派一支小队营救法哈德吗
And you're down to one team covering Farhad?

648
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,097
那万一遇到武装抵抗怎么办
What if they run into resistance?

649
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:36,003
万一遇到会怎样
What if they do?

650
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:38,060
那样的话  你只会开枪打中比你要救的法哈德
Well, at that point, you start shooting at people that have a higher intel value

651
00:34:38,063 --> 00:34:39,093
更有情报价值的人
than the man you're going to try and save.

652
00:34:39,096 --> 00:34:43,006
欧文探员清楚首要任务是全部留活口
Agent Owen knows the priority is to take all hostiles alive.

653
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,036
子弹可不长眼
Under fire?

654
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,080
这项任务艰巨得很啊
No assignment's more difficult.

655
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,086
我对欧文探员很有信心
Agent Owen has my full confidence.

656
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,010
是吗  如果这是真话
Yeah. If that were true,

657
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,070
那你还站在这里和我谈什么
you wouldn't be standing here talking to me.

658
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:56,050
你愿意去营救法哈德吗
You offering to bring in Farhad?

659
00:34:56,083 --> 00:35:01,021
是的  如果你撤销对蕾妮·沃克的刑事调查
Yes. If you drop the criminal investigation against Renee Walker.

660
00:35:01,086 --> 00:35:05,029
听我说  我知道你也不想起诉她
Look, I know you don't want to prosecute her.

661
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,019
我能帮你摆脱两难的处境
I can be your out.

662
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:10,093
我明白你的意思  但我无能为力  杰克
I hear what you're saying, but I can't help you, Jack.

663
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:15,016
我以前也坐过你那个位置
I've sat in that chair before.

664
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:18,099
你现在的这个位置
The chair you're sitting in now.

665
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:20,049
我知道那是什么滋味
I know what it's like.

666
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:22,023
无数的要求  压在你身上
There's a lot of demands on you,

667
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:24,013
而很多都是不合理的
many of them unreasonable.

668
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:26,076
但凡官居此位的人  至关重要的是...
But the people that last here, the ones that mattered...

669
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:30,063
他们知道什么时候说不
they knew when to say no.

670
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:33,033
这次是白宫  你不能说不
It's the White House, you don't say no.

671
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:34,073
你是反恐小组的头儿
You are the head of CTU,

672
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:37,047
你的能耐可比你想的大多了
you've got a lot more juice than you think.

673
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:40,009
尤其是面对核武器事件时
Especially with a nuclear weapon in play.

674
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:45,035
如果我们要这么做  杰克
If we do this, Jack,

675
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:47,003
这就不仅是为一次救援行动了
it's not for one rescue operation.

676
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:49,057
而是得把整件事都圆满了结
It's till this whole thing is over and done.

677
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,034
如果你想让蕾妮脱身
You want Renee freed up,

678
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:53,064
就不能再这么随心所欲了
you're not in and out anymore.

679
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:56,089
我要你全身心投入进来
I want you in with both feet.

680
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:05,059
成交
Deal.

681
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:07,025
成交
Deal.

682
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:15,083
我在皇后区发现一个纽约警局的证物仓库
I found an NYPD evidence warehouse in Queens

683
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:19,056
那里有从毒枭那缴获的十二万赃款
with $120,000 from a drug bust just sitting there.

684
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:23,099
唯一阻碍他们进出的只有巡逻的警卫
It was only a matter of getting them in and out between patrols.

685
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,086
等等  你参与了一起抢劫案吗
Wait, you actually committed a robbery?

686
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:31,093
设身处地为我想想  科尔
Put yourself in my place, Cole.

687
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:34,069
卡文打算向黑斯廷斯告发我的犯罪史
Kevin was going to tell Hastings I'm a convicted felon.

688
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:36,056
他打算毁了我的生活
He was going to ruin my life.

689
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:37,086
换了你会怎么做
What would you have done?

690
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:39,019
反正不会这么做
Not this.

691
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:44,036
卡文向我承诺如果我跟他合作
Kevin promised that if I went along,

692
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,036
他就不再来骚扰我了
he would never bother me again.

693
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,099
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

694
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:50,023
他最后食言了
He didn't keep his end of the bargain.

695
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,093
这就是你在这的原因  对吗
That's why you're here, isn't it?

696
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,056
你什么意思
What do you mean?

697
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,059
你手里拿的是什么
What's in your hand?

698
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:14,067
你刚才打算去杀了他们
You were going to kill them.

699
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,073
我不知道自己还有什么办法
I don't know what I was going to do.

700
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:18,073
你打算无情地杀了他们
You were going to shoot them in cold blood.

701
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:20,069
科尔  听我说
Cole, listen to me.

702
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:22,073
我错了
I was wrong.

703
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:25,099
我知道错了  但我很害怕
I see that now, but I was scared.

704
00:37:26,003 --> 00:37:28,079
我本以为这么做是为了我们
I thought that I was doing this for us.

705
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,043
为我们  你疯了吗
For us? Are you out of your mind?

706
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,060
我爱你  科尔
I love you, Cole.

707
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:40,083
别说了
Don't say another word.

708
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:43,013
什么都别说了
Not one more word.

709
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:46,089
科尔  你要去哪  科尔
Cole, where are you going? Cole!

710
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:48,099
待在车里
Stay in the truck.

711
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:51,033
科尔  别这样
Cole, don't do this.

712
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,053
科尔
Cole.

713
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:54,083
求你了  求你别这么做
Please, I am begging you.

714
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:56,036
这是我的问题  不是你的
This is my problem, not yours.

715
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,067
退后
Stay back.

716
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,022
什么
What?

717
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:16,019
去拿枪呀  那样的话
Yeah, go for it. That way,

718
00:38:16,023 --> 00:38:18,006
我只要和你们中活着的那个谈就行了
I only have to deal with one of you losers.

719
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:23,003
我想你找错门了吧  哥们
I think you got the wrong address, pal.

720
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:24,043
是吗
Oh, do I?

721
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:26,003
但我可不这么认为
Somehow, I don't think so.

722
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:29,079
或许你应该告诉我们你想要什么
Hey, maybe you should just tell us what it is you want.

723
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,019
也许是该你闭上嘴好好听着
Maybe you should shut up and listen.

724
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:32,074
科尔  求你了  我们走吧
Cole, please, come on. Let's just get out of here.

725
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:41,024
你看起来很眼熟啊
I thought you looked familiar.

726
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,036
来看看  尼克
Looky here, Nick.

727
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,056
-是大兵哥啊  -嗯
- It's soldier boy. - Mm-hmm.

728
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,036
别开玩笑了
No kidding.

729
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,069
知道吗  
You know,

730
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:54,036
真遗憾  我们不能抽空一起去喝一杯
it's a shame that you and I can't go grab a beer sometime.

731
00:38:54,036 --> 00:38:55,070
就我们俩
You know, just the two of us.

732
00:38:57,063 --> 00:38:59,095
我相信  我们一定颇有共同语言
I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about.

733
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:01,013
我叫你闭嘴
I said shut up.

734
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:06,066
现在  我给你们两条路走
Now, the way I see it, you guys have two choices.

735
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:08,083
第一条路  回去蹲监狱
One, you go back to prison

736
00:39:08,086 --> 00:39:11,066
罪名为盗窃财产和蓄意伤人
for grand larceny and aggravated assault.

737
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:14,056
若我进了监狱  她也吃不了兜着走
I go back to prison, she goes back to prison.

738
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:18,009
我猜她已经准备好去里面蹲一阵子了
My guess is, she's prepared to live with that.

739
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:23,043
第二条路  我放你们走
Choice number two, I let you walk.

740
00:39:23,046 --> 00:39:25,059
你们留着那些钱
You keep your 100 grand

741
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,049
有多少算多少
or what's left of it

742
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:31,003
然后从哪来的回哪去
and you go back to wherever it is you came from.

743
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:33,073
就这样吗
That's it?

744
00:39:33,076 --> 00:39:34,096
就是这样
That's it.

745
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:38,069
但要是再让我在这城里看见你们俩
But if I ever see you in this city again...

746
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:43,033
要是让我听说你们跨越州界
if I even hear about you crossing the state line,

747
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:47,009
别怪我痛下杀手  翻脸不认人
I'll skip the formalities and kill you myself.

748
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:51,073
能照办吗
Do we have a deal or not?

749
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:56,046
没问题
Yeah.

750
00:39:57,049 --> 00:39:59,056
我们照办就是了
We got a deal.

751
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,086
最好是这样
Better be sure.

752
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:05,096
我不想再见到你们中任何一个
I don't want to see either one of you ever again.

753
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,093
你要干嘛
Hey, what are you doing?

754
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:28,039
-跟着他  -为什么
- Going after him. - Why?

755
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,006
我们把他给做了
Oh, we get rid of him,

756
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:31,086
就能再利用她重操旧业了
we're right back in business with her.

757
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:33,029
得了吧  伙计
Come on, man.

758
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,063
我们已经得手了
We got what we came for.

759
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,099
比想象的多得多
We got more.

760
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,066
我们... 就别再得寸进尺了
Let's just... let's not push our luck.

761
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:41,093
好吗
All right?

762
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:43,023
拜托了  好吗
Come on, all right?

763
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,049
我们才刚刚开始呢
We're just getting started.

764
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:51,029
我们该收手了  好吗
We're done. Okay?

765
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,049
明白了吗
You got me?

766
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,046
科尔
Cole.

767
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:05,099
你刚才为我挺身而出的那一幕
What you did back there,

768
00:41:06,003 --> 00:41:07,016
我永远铭刻于心
I'll never forget it.

769
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:08,093
回反恐小组吧
Let's just get back to CTU.

770
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,005
科尔  我是真心的
Cole, I'm serious.

771
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:12,032
谢谢
Thank you.

772
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:18,043
科尔
Cole.

773
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:24,043
珍妮
Jenny!

774
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,018
对不起
I'm sorry.

775
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:08,027
我不该回来的
I shouldn't have come back.
