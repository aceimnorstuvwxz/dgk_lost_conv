1
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:14,012
《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

2
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:18,023
利维  找到能接替伊桑的人恐怕还要几周
Livy, it could take weeks to find Ethan's replacement.

3
00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:22,024
在这段时间里  我还需要一个代理参谋长
In the meantime, I'm going to need a provisional chief of staff.

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,010
我想任命你
I would like that to be you.

5
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:26,004
拉里·莫斯想跟您通话
I have Larry Moss calling for you.

6
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,061
总统阁下  我们有证据表明
Ma'am, we have evidence

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,011
朱玛允许斯塔克伍德把桑加拉
Juma allowed Starkwood to use

8
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:31,054
作为制造生化武器的实验基地
Sangala as a base to manufacture biological weapons.

9
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:33,035
你是说这些武器就在美国本土吗
Are you saying these weapons are on us soil?

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,048
我们猜测这些武器就在
We suspect they're at the Starkwood headquarters

11
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:35,068
斯塔克伍德的弗吉尼亚总部
In Virginia.

12
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:37,058
你该不会是认为斯塔克伍德
And you're not suggesting that Starkwood intends

13
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,055
会使用这些武器来攻击我们的国家吗
To use those weapons to attack this country?

14
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:40,072
照他们今天的行动来看
Given their actions today,

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,079
我们必须马上对斯塔克伍德采取措施
We need to move on Starkwood immediately.

16
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:44,019
他们快杀将过来了
They're coming.

17
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:46,046
而且会拿着所掌握的证据找上门来
And they'll be coming with everything they've got.

18
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:49,030
唯一能制止他们的办法
And the only thing that's going to stop them

19
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:51,043
就是部署好这些武器
Is getting these weapons ready to deploy.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,003
告诉我联邦调查局掌握了多少我们的情况
Tell me what the FBI knows.

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,024
我什么也不知道
I don't know anything,

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,040
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges.

23
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,031
把他带出去
Get him out of here

24
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,054
该用刑时就用刑
And do what you have to do.

25
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:04,021
我不想因为乔纳斯·霍奇斯的疯狂行为
I'm not spending the rest of my life

26
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,071
而在监狱里过下半辈子
In prison because Jonas Hodges has lost his mind.

27
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:08,048
-你知道武器在哪里吗  -是的
- You know where the weapons are? - Yes.

28
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:10,028
杰克在哪
Where's Jack?

29
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:12,022
他试图保护武器不被夺走
He managed to secure the weapons,

30
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,095
但还是被斯塔克伍德抢了回去
But Starkwood got him back.

31
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,059
杰克暴露在毒气中
Jack was exposed.

32
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,084
但你们一定有办法可以救他
There has to be something that you can do to help him.

33
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:19,009
无药可医
There's no cure.

34
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:20,092
我们知道武器的方位了
We got a location on the weapon.

35
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,076
我们正准备派部队进行突袭
We're getting ready to stage a raid on the compound

36
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:23,075
我要参加
I want to go.

37
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,050
很抱歉  我不会批准
I'm sorry. i can't allow it.

38
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:27,070
我是唯一见过毒气罐的人
I'm the only one who's seen the canisters.

39
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:29,027
我知道它什么样
I know exactly what we're looking for.

40
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,004
但你被感染了  我们不知道
But you're sick. we have no idea

41
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,051
你什么时候会发作
When you're going to start showing symptoms.

42
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:33,057
你是对的
You're right.

43
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:40,055
武器到底在哪里
Where are the damn weapons?!

44
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,045
他耍了我
He played me.

45
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:45,095
西顿老弟给我们争取到了一点时间
Little old Seaton bought us some time.

46
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,065
我们要在整个基地中
We're going to do a point by point search of this entire compound.

47
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,012
做地毯式搜查
Of this entire compound.

48
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,013
这里有生化武器
There are biological weapons on this facility.

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,020
找不到  我们不会走
We're not going anywhere without them.

50
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:00,007
如果你们再得寸进尺
You try to advance any farther,

51
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,024
我们会开枪还击
You will be fired upon.

52
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,024
以下情节发生在凌晨12点至1点间
The following takes place between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m.

53
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:16,074
我数了下至少有三个排的兵力
I count three platoons at least.

54
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,021
全副武装
Everything mil-spec.

55
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:20,008
对  他们这是守株待兔
Yeah. they were waiting for us.

56
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,005
这是个大陷阱
This was one big trap.

57
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,038
蕾妮  用监控卫星帮帮我们
Renee, we would really use those satellite overheads.

58
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,065
收到  拉里
Copy, Larry.

59
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:28,042
-有进展没  -没有
- What have we got? - Nothing.

60
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,059
子网已经崩溃了
The subnet's been crashing.

61
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,009
等一下  等等  好了
Okay, wait, wait, wait. here we go.

62
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,019
我已重新连上5号卫星
I've got sat five retasting now...

63
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,056
谁能告诉我
Somebody talk to me.

64
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,083
你们都看见什么了
What are you seeing?

65
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,049
拉里  你们被四面包围了
Larry, you've got hostiles on all sides.

66
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,030
该死  给我找个突破口
Damn it. find me an opening.

67
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,088
正在找  但是没有能突围的路线
I'm looking, but there's no way through.

68
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,093
注意  大家都看见了吗
Okay, heads up. Is everybody seeing this?

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,013
拉里
Larry?

70
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,034
是的
Yeah.

71
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,061
我们看见了
Yeah. we're seeing it.

72
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:02,062
是霍奇斯
It's Hodges.

73
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,026
弟兄们听候您的差遣  先生
The men are at the ready, sir.

74
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:07,089
多谢您能亲自出马
I appreciate your presence.

75
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:09,073
那我还能去哪儿
Where else would i be?

76
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:12,036
谁是负责人
Who's in charge here?

77
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:14,023
我
I am.

78
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,060
我是莫斯探员
Agent Moss.

79
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:18,064
你得叫你的人退下  让我们继续搜查
You need to move your men and allow us to proceed.

80
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,040
我要你们离开我们的领地
I want you off our property.

81
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:22,064
还得把我的人放了
And i want you to release my man.

82
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,061
你们没权力把他扣为人质
You have no right to take him hostage.

83
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:27,048
我是奉美国总统之令行事
I have an order from the president of the united states.

84
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,098
奉命来搜查这栋楼
To search this building.

85
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:33,078
找出那些莫须有的武器
For weapons that do not exist.

86
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:36,009
搜了吗
Have you looked?

87
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,009
有大规模杀伤性武器吗
Are there weapons of mass destruction?

88
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,092
有任何武器吗
Are there weapons of any kind?

89
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:44,016
到底有还是没有
Is there anything in here at all?!

90
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:51,013
莫斯探员
Agent Moss,

91
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,027
谁这么异想天开
Who dreamed up this charade?

92
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,034
报上名来
Give me a name.

93
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,064
我们得追究到底
Let's get to the bottom of this.

94
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:01,021
你想跟我谈  霍奇斯先生
You want to talk to me, Mr. Hodges?

95
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:03,035
就让你的人把枪都放下
Get these guns off my head.

96
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,028
被人拿枪指着头就受不了了吗
You think you have a gun at your head?

97
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,075
那我呢
You know what i've got?

98
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:10,055
大半夜的  美国政府兵临城下
I've got the United States government sending SWAT Teams

99
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,076
派来了特警队还有武装直升机
And attack helicopters in the middle of the night.

100
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:17,063
我可是为国效忠了整整30个春秋啊
I've got a government that i served faithfully for 30 years,

101
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,010
换来的却是  那些没种露出真实嘴脸的
Dreaming up bs accusations,

102
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:23,057
政客们编造出一系列莫须有的指控
So politicians too cowardly to show their faces,

103
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,080
葬送了我毕生的基业
Can dismantle my company.

104
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,024
这就是我得到的回报
That's what i've got.

105
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:33,038
给你5分钟时间
You've got five minutes

106
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:36,038
你和你的手下坐着这些直升机
To get these-these helicopters flying out of here

107
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,055
给我离开这儿
With all of you on board.

108
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,095
你不能这样
You don't want to do this.

109
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:42,065
就5分钟
Five minutes.

110
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,084
放了我的人
And i want my man back.

111
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,073
蕾妮  听见了吗
Renee, you get that?

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,083
我们听见了
Yeah, we did.

113
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,087
-有何良策  -就5分钟吗
- And what options do we have? - In five minutes?

114
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:58,070
我知道没时间调兵遣将作战术支援了
I know there's no time to bring in more tac support,

115
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:00,000
有别的路可走吗
So give me something else.

116
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,014
好吧  拉里  给我一点时间  等一下
All right, Larry, give me a second. stand by.

117
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,021
就是这个
That's it.

118
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,075
我要给你看点儿东西
I want to show you something.

119
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:11,025
霍奇斯只给我们5分钟撤离基地
Hodges just gave us five minutes to clear the base.

120
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:13,006
形势对我们不利  我们失去了制胜先机
We lost that situation. we were outmaneuvered

121
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,052
但是我想我找到了一个新突破口
But i think i found us a new way in.

122
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:16,042
看  这是迈尔参议员提供的文件
Look. these are senator Mayer's files.

123
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,028
道格拉斯·诺尔斯  斯塔克伍德的主席
This is Douglas Knowles. he's the chairman of Starkwood.

124
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,059
就是他协助参议员进行调查
He was actually helping the senator with the investigation.

125
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:24,033
是他暗中协助披露了公司内幕
He is the one who brokered the deal to open the company's books.

126
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,093
又一个内应吗  不是刚上过一回当吗
What, another insider? didn't we just get burned?

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,016
听着
Just listen.

128
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:29,027
诺尔斯为霍奇斯干了快20年了
Knowles was loyal to Hodges for almost 20 years.

129
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,070
现在他却秘密地协助
And now he's secretly helping the

130
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,087
参议员搞垮斯塔克伍德公司
senator take down the Starkwood.

131
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:33,000
他有顾虑
He's scared of something.

132
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,094
这家伙会帮上我们的
This man wants to help us.

133
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,041
值得一试
It's worth a shot.

134
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:38,027
好的  给他打电话
Yeah. make the call.

135
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,038
我是诺尔斯
Knowles.

136
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,019
诺尔斯先生  我是杰克·鲍尔
Mr. Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.

137
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,095
我从迈尔参议员那得到了你的号码
I got your number from senator Mayer.

138
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,046
迈尔参议员已经死了
Senator Mayer is dead.

139
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,042
是的  我知道  他遇害时我和他在一起
Yes, sir, i know. i was with him when he was killed

140
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:55,046
他是被你们的人杀的
By one of your employees.

141
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,087
名字叫约翰·奎恩
A man named John Quinn.

142
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:03,057
你不知道我有多希望有人来找我
You have no idea how much i was hoping someone would call.

143
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,070
抱歉  先生  我不明白
I'm sorry, sir. i don't understand.

144
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:07,087
事态越发地失控了
Things are very out of control.

145
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:10,029
你知道基地上正发生的事吗
Are you aware of what's happening on your base?

146
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:12,044
我正看着呢
I'm watching it with my own eyes.

147
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:13,071
联邦调查局被牵制住了
The FBI is pinned down.

148
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,041
他们说是来找生化武器的
They say they're looking for bioweapons.

149
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,028
先生  乔纳斯·霍奇斯手上持有
Sir, Jonas Hodges is  in possession.

150
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:19,022
军用级生化武器
Of a military-grade bioweapon.

151
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:21,079
是朱玛将军在非洲研发的朊病毒变体
A prion variant developed in Africa with General Juma.

152
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:23,089
武器不在他们搜的地方
Well, it's not where they think it is.

153
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:26,026
那不过是个空的飞机库
They're all standing in front of an empty hangar.

154
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:28,032
调查局被一个叫西顿的人给摆了一道
The FBI was deliberately led to the wrong location

155
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,016
被他带入了错误的方位  但我向您保证
By a man named Seaton, but i promise you, sir,

156
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,063
武器就在你们的基地
The weapon is on your base.

157
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,033
我试图拦截毒气罐时被感染了
I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters.

158
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
大概90分钟前
They were ferried back to Starkwood

159
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:36,093
他们被运回斯塔克伍德公司了
Approximately 90 minutes ago.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,014
90分钟前  乔纳斯刚向董事会
90 minutes ago Jonas was handing down

161
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,080
宣布了他的全新战略
His new strategy to the board.

162
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:44,041
抵制政府  决不合作
Stonewall the government, no cooperation whatsoever.

163
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:46,044
难以置信会有这种事情发生
I can't believe this is happening.

164
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:48,008
先生  木已成舟
Sir, this is happening.

165
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:49,095
我发誓武器就在你们的基地
And i promise you the weapons are on your base.

166
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,008
你是否知道武器可能所在的位置
Do you have any idea where they might be?

167
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,035
我想我可能知道
I think i might.

168
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,054
诺尔斯先生  我要你
Mr. Knowles, i want to put you

169
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:57,025
跟我们在现场的一个外勤探员联系
in touch with one of my men in the field.

170
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,012
-能再打给你吗  -好的
- Can i call you right back? - Yes.

171
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,052
谢谢  走
Thank you. go.

172
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:04,093
有些弟兄不乐意招惹联邦探员
Some of the men were unhappy drawing down on federal agents.

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
可以理解
It's understandable.

174
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:10,003
我本就不希望拉普通士兵入伙
I had hoped not to include the rank and file.

175
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,017
他们靠得住的
You can count on them.

176
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:15,040
该下逐客令了
Let's show our guests the door.

177
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,094
行动
Let's move!

178
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,075
各就各位
Into position.

179
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:30,049
杰克  我耳机开了
Jack, i'm on comm.

180
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,070
我和沃克探员跟你通话
You're on with me and agent Walker.

181
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,096
霍奇斯的人开始重新部署了
Hodges' men have repositioned themselves.

182
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,079
好吧  我们动作要快点儿
Okay, we're going to have to move fast.

183
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,099
拉里  我要你和你的人
Larry, i want you and your men

184
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,046
佯装按霍奇斯的意思准时撤兵
To pull out on Hodges' timetable.

185
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:40,023
托尼  你想办法潜伏下来
Tony, you're going to need to find a way to stay behind.

186
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,033
我们要通过无线电让你
We're going to get your vectors

187
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,053
跟一个斯塔克伍德内部人士取得联系
over to a man that we contact inside Starkwood.

188
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,070
他叫道格拉斯·诺尔斯
His name is Douglas Knowles.

189
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,024
他知道武器藏在哪里
He believes he knows where the weapons are.

190
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,030
刚才不就是这么掉进陷阱的吗
Isn't this how we got into this mess?

191
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:50,037
阿尔梅达和某个貌似友好的内应
Almeida and some supposedly friendly contact?

192
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,047
诺尔斯是斯塔克伍德公司的主席
Knowles is chairman

193
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,088
他曾经协助参议员迈尔
Of the Starkwood board, but he was cooperating

194
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:54,064
调查斯塔克伍德公司
With senator Mayer's investigation of the company.

195
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,005
拉里  我们全靠他了
Larry, he is all that we've got.

196
00:07:57,028 --> 00:08:00,038
我这有200双训练有素的眼睛盯着我呢
All right, i got 400 eyeballs trained on me right now.

197
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:02,059
怎么才能让阿尔梅达潜伏下来啊
How the hell are we supposed to get Almeida to stay behind?

198
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,039
拉里  你带着手下分散他们的注意力
Larry, i need you and your men to create a diversion

199
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:05,042
掩护托尼撤退
To cover Tony's escape.

200
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:07,042
听着  成败在此一举
Look, we need to make this work.

201
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,089
要是你们全都上了直升机
If you all get on those helicopters together,

202
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:10,093
咱们就永远失去夺回武器的机会了
We are going to lose this weapon for good.

203
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:17,040
拉里  你同意吗
Larry, are you on board with this?

204
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,077
我们得撤了
We got to go.

205
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,074
拉里  告诉我们  你同意不
Larry, we need to know, are you on board?

206
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:25,047
我尽力而为吧
I'll do what i can.

207
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:29,030
拿上他的包
Take his bag.

208
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,095
好了  我们走
All right, let's go.

209
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:33,012
我们撤退  你跟我走
We're standing down. you're coming with me.

210
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,055
等等
Hey, wait a minute.

211
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:35,095
协议里面没这项
This wasn't part of the deal.

212
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:37,019
什么协议  就我所知  不管怎样
What deal? As far as I could tell,

213
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,099
-他都不会管你的  -莫斯
- he couldn't care about you，one way or the other. - Moss.

214
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:41,039
把我的手铐打开
You take these handcuffs off of me

215
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:42,066
不然事情会越发不可收拾
Or it's going to get really ugly.

216
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,083
兄弟住手
Soldier!

217
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,027
滚吧  莫斯
Get the hell out of here, Moss.

218
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,034
别考验我们的耐心
You don't want to test us.

219
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:00,024
我们走
Let's go!

220
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,075
-不许动  -别开枪
- Don't move.  - No!

221
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,002
我是道格·诺尔斯
Doug Knowles.

222
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,022
-杰克·鲍尔叫我来的  -快过来
- Jack Bauer sent me.- Come on.

223
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,077
那条街上有监控摄像头
That street has security cameras.

224
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,097
现在带你去个禁区
I'll take you to a restricted area.

225
00:09:58,004 --> 00:09:59,037
就在东区
It's on the east perimeter.

226
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:01,027
武器很有可能在那里
There's a good chance the weapons are there.

227
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:03,031
这里到处是巡逻兵
The place is crawling.

228
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,081
不知道我们怎样才能过去
I don't know how we're going to make it.

229
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:06,048
交给我吧
I'll take care of that.

230
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,078
杰克  我和诺尔斯接上头了

231

236
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:24,023
你们刚刚离开停机坪
I've got you just off the landing pad.

237
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,086
附近没有敌人
No hostiles in your immediate vicinity.

238
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:27,003
谨慎前进
Proceed at your own discretion.

239
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,003
收到
Copy that.

240
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,000
哪边
Which way?

241
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,090
杰克
Jack.

242
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:39,074
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

243
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,033
托尼和诺尔斯接上头了  一切正常
Tony and Knowles have connected. We're good.

244
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:43,095
该向白宫汇报进展了
It's time to call the White House with an update.

245
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:46,002
好的  我一会就去
Okay, good. I'll be right there.

246
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:06,017
总统阁下  抱歉打断你们的谈话
Madam President, excuse the interruption.

247
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:11,060
杰克·鲍尔在7号线上
Jack Bauer is on line seven.

248
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:17,068
鲍尔先生  告诉我你拿到生化武器了
Mr. Bauer, tell me you have the bioweapon.

249
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:19,081
总统阁下  恐怕进展不尽如人意
Madam President, I'm afraid that's not the case.

250
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,087
搜查被斯塔克伍德基地的
Our search was stopped by armed mercenaries

251
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:22,088
武装雇佣军阻止了
On Starkwood's base.

252
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:24,076
莫斯探员和他的手下被迫
Agent Moss and his men were forced to withdraw

253
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,082
从一场必败的战斗中退了回来
From a firefight they most certainly would have lost.

254
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:28,055
你是说霍奇斯的手下准备
Are you saying Hodges’ men were ready to fire

255
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,019
向联邦探员开火吗
On federal agents?

256
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:31,072
是的  总统阁下
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

257
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,076
天哪
My god!

258
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,090
真是胆大包天
Who does he think he is?!

259
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,050
总统阁下  尽管我们行动受挫
Madam President, despite the setback,

260
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:39,020
但我确信武器还在那里
I am confident the weapons are still there.

261
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:40,087
我已联系斯塔克伍德的主席
I reached out to Starkwood's chairman.

262
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:43,030
他愿意合作  正和托尼·阿尔梅达在一起
He's willing to cooperate. He's with Tony Alameida now.

263
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,040
他们正赶往基地的安全区
They are moving towards a secure area on the base

264
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,004
我们相信武器就藏在那里
Where we believe the weapons are being held.

265
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,021
非常好
Very good.

266
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,037
蒂姆  部队现在什么情况
Tim, what's our troop status?

267
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,041
正在调遣
Mobilizing.

268
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:51,054
国防部长说
The Secretary of Defense says

269
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:52,078
他们还要几个小时
They're still several hours out.

270
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:54,045
现在大战在即
At which point we have a war on our hands

271
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:55,088
我们要对付的是1500名
Against 1,500 mercenaries

272
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:57,055
装备了生化武器的雇佣兵
Armed with bioweapons.

273
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:59,009
总统阁下  我相信
Madam President, I do believe that

274
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,070
只要能确定武器的精确位置
a surgical air strike will work as long as

275
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,092
发动迅猛的空袭必能奏效
we can pinpoint the exact location of the weapon.

276
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,099
你能做到吗
And you can do that?

277
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,036
是的  我相信我们能
Yes, I believe we can.

278
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,033
鲍尔先生  你看过
Mr. Bauer, you've seen the canisters

279
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,056
装生化武器的罐子
Containing the bioweapons, you know what

280
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,028
你知道它们的样子吧
They look like, is that correct?

281
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,013
是的  总统阁下
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:13,043
一旦阿尔梅达找到毒气罐
Then we'll need you to verify the canisters

283
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,057
需要你去核实
Once Almeida has located them.

284
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,014
不得有误
No more mistakes.

285
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,011
鲍尔  我们需要你亲眼验证
We're gonna need visual confirmation from you, Bauer-- eyes on.

286
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:23,011
杰克  这一环节不容出现任何差池
Jack, we have got to get this part right.

287
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:24,074
了解  还有什么吩咐吗
I understand. anything else?

288
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:32,068
杰克  我听说你被病原体感染了
Jack, I have been told that you were exposed to the pathogen.

289
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:34,029
你现在怎样
How you doing?

290
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,072
现在我很好  总统阁下
Right now I'm fine, Madam President.

291
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,019
谢谢您的问候
Thank you for asking.

292
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,029
感谢你为国家做出的贡献
Thank you for your service.

293
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,016
我不会让你就这样死去的
I'm not giving up on you.

294
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:43,076
有事随时通知我
Keep me informed.

295
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,023
好  总统阁下
Yes, ma'am.

296
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,030
走吧
Let's go.

297
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,041
我现在很忙
I don't have a lot of time.

298
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,054
怎么了
What's going on?

299
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,071
我还要问你怎么了呢
That's what i've been trying to ask you.

300
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,078
我打了三次电话
I called three times.

301
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:03,045
我现在快忙死了
It's kind of crazy here right now.

302
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,092
除非你有急事  我等会再打给你
Unless it's urgent, I gotta call you back.

303
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:08,002
我听说召开了参谋长联席会议
I'm hearing rumors that the joint chiefs have been called in.

304
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:10,042
没什么大事
It's not a big deal.

305
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,079
他们只是在降低警报等级前
They're just doing a final assessment

306
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:13,009
做最后评估
Before lowering the alert level.

307
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,046
奥利维亚  别来这套
Olivia, don't do this.

308
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,079
什么
What?

309
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,013
我说的是实话啊
I'm telling you the truth.

310
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,086
是吗
Really?

311
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:20,067
港务局集装箱堆积场的线人
Because I've got a source in the port authority

312
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:23,076
说的是大规模杀伤性武器
Container yard who's using terms like "weapons of mass destruction,"

313
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:25,021
自然我就会想
so naturally I'm wondering

314
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,054
这就是召开参谋长联席会议的原因吧
If that's why the joint chiefs are having a meeting.

315
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:30,001
听着  我对此无可奉告
Look, I can't talk about it.

316
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,018
这关系到国家安全
It's obviously a question of national security.

317
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,031
但我保证  我会第一时间告诉你
But you have my word I'll tell you soon as I can.

318
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:35,075
我现在就想知道
I want to know now.

319
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:40,025
肯  我可刚给了你一条爆炸性新闻
I just gave you a big story, Ken.

320
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:42,019
这次你得等了  我要挂了
You'll have to wait. I gotta go.

321
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:44,082
奥利维亚  别挂
Don't hang up on me, Olivia.

322
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,099
否则你会后悔莫及
That'd be a big mistake.

323
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,069
你什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

324
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:52,063
好吧  这可是你逼我说的
You want me to say it, fine, I'll say it.

325
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,080
想想吧  要是你妈知道
Think how your mother would feel when she hears

326
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:56,033
是你逼走她的参谋长
That you forced out her chief of staff

327
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,081
而取而代之  她会作何感想
So you could take over his position.

328
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:01,084
是他自己无能
He was incompetent.

329
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,041
但早报不会这么写
Yeah, well, it won't play that way on the morning news.

330
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:06,044
还是对我实话实说吧
So, talk to me.

331
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:08,038
就现在
Now.

332
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:11,098
我不能在这告诉你
I can't talk here.

333
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,075
我在罗斯福大陆酒店1271房间
I'm in the Roosevelt Continental, room 1271.

334
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:17,002
给你半小时时间
You've got half an hour.

335
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,017
皮尔斯探员  请给我备辆车
Agent Pierce, please get a car ready.

336
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:28,090
我有急事
I have to make a quick run.

337
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,034
杰克  我们到了
All right, Jack, we're here.

338
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,084
诺尔斯说这几天
Knowles says there's been increased activity

339
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,028
这片区域内活动频繁
In this area for several days now.

340
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,091
我看了约6栋建筑
I'm looking at about a half a dozen buildings.

341
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,035
每栋都有可能
Could be any one of them.

342
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,045
收到  托尼
Copy that, Tony.

343
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,005
别挂  红外线扫描中
Hold on, we're getting infrared up now.

344
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:49,039
我看到在你附近有7栋建筑
I'm counting seven buildings in your immediate vicinity.

345
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,002
你的正东南方向的建筑
The building directly southeast of your current

346
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,066
没有显示红外信号
Position is showing no infrared signal.

347
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:57,073
可能被屏蔽了
I'm guessing they're using a blackout shield.

348
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,003
好的  我们先去那看看
All right, we'll try there first.

349
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,093
路上有没有巡逻的
You see any patrols coming our way?

350
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,073
没有  很安全
Negative, you're clear.

351
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,067
好的  走吧
Okay, let's go.

352
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,095
杰克  诺尔斯的钥匙卡开不了门
Jack, Knowles' key card isn't working.

353
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:24,002
需要电子支持
We're gonna need electronic support here.

354
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,061
在你的通信装置背面
There should be an R-6 interface module

355
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:28,001
应该有个R-6接口模件
On the back of your comm device.

356
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:30,032
我知道那是什么  谢谢
Yeah, I know what that is, thank you.

357
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,000
我插进去了
I'm plugging in now.

358
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,007
好  开始
Okay, we're up.

359
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:39,050
是库马克Z系列
Cormac z series.

360
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,034
我们在解密5位数的电子钥匙
We're looking at a five digit key

361
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,008
它受高标加密模式下的分组密码保护
Protected by an AES block cipher.

362
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:46,091
正在解码
Running combinations.

363
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:49,041
托尼  有辆车正向你方驶来
Okay, Tony, you've got a vehicle coming your way.

364
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,065
在你东侧距离约100码
It's east of you about a hundred yards.

365
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,075
到下面找掩护
Take cover down there.

366
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,032
还有多久
How much longer?

367
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,008
你还需要多久
How much more time do you need?

368
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,099
5个数字才解出2个
I only have two out of five digits.

369
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,023
我们在这里完全无法隐蔽
We're pretty exposed here.

370
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,093
杰克
Jack?

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,085
我没事
It's all right, I'm fine.

372
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:10,067
快
Come on.

373
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,039
趴下
Stand down.

374
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:25,008
托尼  还差2个数字
Two more numbers, Tony.

375
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,079
我们该怎么办
What are we gonna do?

376
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:31,069
还差2个数没解出
We still got two digits to go.

377
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:34,006
靠近看看
Move in for a closer look.

378
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:35,066
我们躲不过了
We are not gonna make it.

379
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:36,086
待在这别动
Sit tight.

380
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:39,023
道格  你去哪  道格
Doug, where you-- Doug!

381
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:55,038
站住别动
Hold your position.

382
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,045
让我看看证件
May I see some ID?

383
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:59,072
道格·诺尔斯
Doug Knowles.

384
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,034
糟了
Dame it.

385
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:07,001
还差1个
One to go.

386
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:11,060
抱歉  诺尔斯先生
I apologize, Mr. Knowles.

387
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,016
霍奇斯先生已经下令
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base

388
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,052
本基地所有无关人员不得擅闯
Cleared of all nonessential personnel.

389
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,017
无关人员
Nonessential personnel?

390
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:19,020
我是董事会主席
I'm chairman of the board.

391
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:22,027
我理解  可我们正处在高度戒备状态
I realize that, but we're dealing with a heightened security situation here.

392
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:24,094
所以我要知道您来这有何贵干
So, I need to know what you were doing in this area.

393
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:28,005
乔纳斯深夜召开董事会
Jonas called a late night board meeting,

394
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,043
所以我出现在这里
that's what I'm doing here.

395
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,038
先生  那会议12小时前就散了
Sir, that meeting ended nearly 12 hours ago.

396
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:34,062
完成  可以进去了
We got it; we're in.

397
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:37,019
我无须向你解释
I don't have to explain myself to you, you know.

398
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:40,029
抱歉  先生  可你必须解释
I'm sorry, sir, but you do.

399
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,069
先生  我想你没听懂我的话
Sir, I don't believe you're hearing me.

400
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:44,056
不  是你没有听懂我的话
No, I don't think you're hearing me!

401
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,040
是我建立了这家公司
I built this company!

402
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,033
不需要你来教我
And I don't need you telling me

403
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,047
我该去哪儿不该去哪儿
Where I can and cannot walk!

404
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:52,014
明白吗
Understood?!

405
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,090
先生  你得和我们走一趟
You're gonna have to come with me, sir.

406
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:55,061
这边走
Right this way.

407
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,031
我进来了
I'm in.

408
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,061
可他们带走了诺尔斯
But they got Knowles.

409
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:04,005
你觉得他会走漏消息吗
Do you think he's gonna say anything?

410
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:05,022
不清楚
I don't know.

411
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,069
不过我最好快进快出
But I better get in and out as fast as possible,

412
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,072
以防他泄露消息
just in case he does.

413
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,059
托尼  总统需要
Okay, Tony, the president needs a visual

414
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,008
在发动攻击前亲眼看到武器
On the weapons before she'll launch an attack.

415
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,088
她需要你亲眼看到毒气罐
She needs your eyes on the canisters

416
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,029
然后由杰克确认
and a confirmation by Jack.

417
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:17,076
收到
Copy that.

418
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,063
很好
Good.

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
杰克
Jack?

420
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:26,000
待在这  我马上回来
Stay here, i'll be right back.

421
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,008
杰克  杰克
Jack! Jack?!

422
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,094
杰克
Jack!

423
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,045
杰克
Jack?!

424
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:36,035
杰克
Jack?

425
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:37,082
叫医护人员来
Get me the medic!

426
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,030
是  长官
Yes, sir.

427
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:55,000
我们刚发现诺尔斯先生一个人
We just found Mr. Knowles alone,

428
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,065
在禁区外面
Just outside the restricted zone.

429
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,081
他有合理解释吗
Did he have an explanation?

430
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:02,011
是的  长官  他说他在散步
Yes, sir, he said he was walking.

431
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:04,024
散步
Walking.

432
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,081
要把他带到斯多克斯那里接受审问吗
Should i take him to stokes for interrogation, sir?

433
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:10,088
兄弟  你是在建议我们把他五花大绑
You're suggesting what, soldier, that we strap him down,

434
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,092
逼他招供  就因为他在散步
Extract a confession, because he was walking?

435
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,009
他是董事会主席
He's the chairman of the board.

436
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,066
长官  我只是在请求指示
I was just requesting instructions, sir.

437
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,026
您要我怎么做
What you'd like done.

438
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,060
我要你把他带到他的办公室
I'd like you to take him to his office.

439
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,010
让他舒舒服服的
Make sure he's comfortable.

440
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:26,060
然后盯着他直到我过来
And stay with him until i arrive.

441
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,007
明白  长官
Yes, sir.

442
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:29,050
还有其他指示吗
Will that be all?

443
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:30,074
打给第9区
Call zone nine,

444
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:32,024
叫他们增加安检
Have them double down security.

445
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:35,014
我们得确认诺尔斯先生是一个人
Let's make sure that Mr. Knowles was in fact alone.

446
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:36,021
明白  长官
Yes, sir.

447
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,092
还要多久
How much longer?

448
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,043
半小时
Half an hour.

449
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:54,086
很好
Good.

450
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:57,063
完成后马上通知我
I'll need to know the minute it's done.

451
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,003
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

452
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:08,004
亚伦  可以的话你能在大厅等我吗
Aaron, i'd like you to wait in the hall, if that's okay.

453
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:11,085
泰勒女士  您让我负责您的安全
Ms. taylor, you tasked me with handling your security.

454
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:14,001
我不能让您进入
I can't allow you to enter a hotel room

455
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:16,008
我没有检查过的酒店房间
I haven't vetted.

456
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:20,072
亚伦  感谢你的关心
Aaron, i appreciate the concern.

457
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,082
但你从这里就能看见房门
But you can see the door from here,

458
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,069
我也设了快速拨号
I have you on speed-dial,

459
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:28,073
如果真有什么事  我会大声呼救的
And i can scream very loudly when the occasion demands.

460
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,090
我只需要两分钟去说服一个记者
I just need two minutes to wrangle a reporter.

461
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,020
真的  我不会有事的
Really, i'll be fine.

462
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:36,074
好吧  如有需要  我马上过来
All right, i'll be here if you need me.

463
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:58,002
-想喝点什么  -不用了
- Want a drink? - No.

464
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,079
我想你应该不介意我喝点儿吧
I assume you don't mind if i do.

465
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:03,010
漫长的一天
It's been a day.

466
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,057
我得告诉你
I gotta tell you.

467
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,017
我不喜欢别人威胁我
I don't like being threatened.

468
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:10,050
我知道不合适宜
It was unfortunate.

469
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:11,081
我道歉
I apologize.

470
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:14,004
肯  我们是老相识了
We've known each other a long time, Ken.

471
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,061
我本以为我们已经达成一项共识
I thought we had an understanding.

472
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,008
是达成了
We do.

473
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:19,055
我也很想继续这样
And i want to keep it that way.

474
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,085
我们俩都这么想的  对吗
We both do. am i right?

475
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:28,049
好吧  我跟你说过  我收到线报
Okay, so, i told you, i have this source.

476
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:30,099
线人是港务局集装箱堆积场的警察
Cop,out at the port authority container yard.

477
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,033
嗯
Okay.

478
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,086
他跟我说他看见一些貌似职业杀手的人
He told me he saw these professional assassin types

479
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,020
几个小时前在那里激烈交火
Get into an intense firefight out there a couple hours ago.

480
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,074
据他讲  有人劫持了一批大规模杀伤性武器
According to him, someone hiJacked a WMD

481
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:41,027
不知道要运往何处
out to god knows where.

482
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:44,007
是这样
That's true.

483
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,054
是吗
Yeah.

484
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:47,011
我想知道所有情况
Yeah, i want to know all about it.

485
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:54,068
如果你觉得你只需要点点头
Look, if you think all you've got to do is nod your head

486
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:57,002
来确认我已经知道的消息  那是不行的
Confirming what i already know, then we've got a problem.

487
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:59,039
事关国家安全  肯
It's national security, Ken.

488
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:00,069
我无可奉告
I can't tell you.

489
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:02,059
我说你可以
I'm saying you can.

490
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:05,076
如果这个消息外传  会造成恐慌
If this story breaks, it would create a panic.

491
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,084
人们会受到伤害
People would be hurt.

492
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:09,030
如果你知道内情  你就会明白
If you knew what it was, you'd understand why

493
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,030
为什么要严格保密了
It's got to stay a secret.

494
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,097
没错  就是这样  我会理解的
Right, exactly. i'd understand.

495
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:16,014
相信我  好吗
Have a little faith, okay?

496
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:22,011
好吧  在集装箱堆积场里有生化武器
All right. there is a bioweapon in the container yard.

497
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,008
那群人就是在争夺这个东西
That's what they were fighting over.

498
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:26,041
它是由斯塔克伍德在非洲研制的
It was developed by Starkwood in Africa.

499
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,055
-斯塔克伍德  -没错
- Starkwood? - Right.

500
00:22:28,062 --> 00:22:31,045
他们已将武器运到离这里30英里的基地
They moved it to their base about 30 miles from here.

501
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:36,029
这么说武器现在就在那里了
So it's there right now.

502
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:43,053
这就是联席参谋长会议讨论对策的主题
So this is what the joint chiefs are discussing, what to do about that.

503
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,093
奥利维亚
Olivia...

504
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:57,004
总统已下令  一旦发现毒气罐的位置
The president ordered an air strike

505
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:02,018
就马上进行空中打击
As soon as the exact location of the canisters was known.

506
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,015
现在你明白为什么不能报导此事了吧
So you see why you can't run with this?

507
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:11,002
真的  肯  你不能报导的
Really, Ken, you can't.

508
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,019
很多人的生命岌岌可危
A lot of lives are at stake.

509
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,069
整个计划成功的关键就在于奇袭
The entire plan depends on surprise.

510
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:16,023
你明白的  对吧
You get that, right?

511
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,067
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

512
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:26,084
也许我不应该报导
Maybe i need to kill this story.

513
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:30,009
谢谢
Thank you.

514
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:35,002
我的意思是  也许应该有人来说服我
What i mean is maybe somebody could convince me.

515
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:40,035
你什么意思
What are you saying?

516
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:42,066
你知道我的意思
You know what i'm saying.

517
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:44,082
你发扬爱国精神的时候  真的很美
You're very beautiful when you get all patriotic.

518
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,009
我有跟你说过吗
I ever tell you that?

519
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:47,019
我们已经结束了  我们都同意了
That's over. we agreed.

520
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,050
是你一厢情愿
You agreed.

521
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:52,000
真的  我不想这样
Really, i don't want to do this.

522
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,047
肯
Ken...

523
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:59,027
那就拒绝我吧
Then say no.

524
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:17,079
这是盘多帕敏  能控制发抖的症状
This is Pandopamine which should control the shaking.

525
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,036
按住
Here, apply pressure.

526
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:23,036
你可以每隔两小时  注射一次
You can give yourself an injection once every two hours.

527
00:24:23,043 --> 00:24:24,050
如有需要  可增加次数
More if needed.

528
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:26,010
你觉得我会需要更多的注射吗
You think i'll need more?

529
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:27,047
十有八九  是的
In all likelihood, yes.

530
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:30,077
在接触生化剂后这么快就出现症状
The onset of symptoms so soon after exposure suggests

531
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:33,027
说明生化剂比我们想的要厉害得多
The bio-agent is more virulent than we thought.

532
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,071
我们所做的只是控制症状而已
All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.

533
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:38,011
我明白
I understand.

534
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,005
不过有件事你也许会考虑一下
There's something you may want to consider, though.

535
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,095
什么事
What's that?

536
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:44,098
布莱登大学一直资助朊病毒疾病的研究
Bryden University has been funding some studies on prion diseases.

537
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,085
该研究目前尚处试验阶段
The work is purely experimental at this point,

538
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,026
但它的确提出了治疗方法
but it does suggest treatment.

539
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:49,046
这是好消息啊
That's good news.

540
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:51,049
我不想让你们抱太大希望
I don't want to get anyone's hopes up here.

541
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,073
因为治愈的几率很小
We're talking a slight chance.

542
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,030
治疗方法采用干细胞
A possible treatment using stem cells

543
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,060
需从基因匹配的捐赠者身上提取
From a genetically compatible donor.

544
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:59,093
直系亲属是最好的捐赠人选
An immediate family member would make the best donor candidate.

545
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,007
我看了你的档案
I saw your file.

546
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,004
你有个女儿  对吧
It says you have a daughter, right?

547
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,097
我不想让我的女儿牵涉进来
I don't want my daughter involved in this.

548
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,034
-杰克  如果真有机会治疗  -鲍尔先生
- Jack, if there's a chance. - Mr. Bauer...

549
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,051
医生  谢谢你所做的一切
Doctor, thank you for everything you've done.

550
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:11,075
抱歉  我得回去做事了
Excuse me. i need to get back to work.

551
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:18,005
杰克
Jack...

552
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:20,027
这不关你的事
This is none of your business.

553
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:22,000
你在调查局里病情发作
It's my business when you're having a seizure

554
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,032
-这就关我的事  -你听到医生的话了
- In the middle of the FBI. - You heard the doctor.

555
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,069
治疗只是抑制了病症
The medication will mask the symptoms.

556
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:27,019
你为什么就不愿意谈一下呢
Why won't you even talk about this?

557
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,023
-谈什么  -实验治疗疗程
- Talk about what? - The experimental procedure.

558
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,086
因为没什么好谈的
Because there's nothing to talk about.

559
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:33,077
她是你女儿  你难道不打算让她知道吗
She's your daughter, and you're not even gonna let her know?

560
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,074
对
That's right.

561
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,094
你甚至连试一试都不愿意吗
So you're just not even gonna try?

562
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:39,036
蕾妮  我知道你想帮我
Renee, i know you're trying to help,

563
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:40,054
但你不了解情况
But you don't know what you're talking about here.

564
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:44,021
我女儿跟我都不说话的  明白吗
My daughter and i, we don't talk, okay?

565
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:45,075
所以  请你不要再管了
So, please, just let it go.

566
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:51,022
这应该由她来决定
It should be her choice.

567
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,042
不是
Well, it's not.

568
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:57,022
我才是快死的那个  该由我来决定
I'm the one who's dying. it's my choice.

569
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:05,013
还没有发现目标  托尼正在寻找
No sign of the target yet, but Tony's working on it.

570
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,073
你看起来好多了
You look better.

571
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,037
谢谢
Thanks.

572
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:11,024
托尼  听得到吗
Tony, can you hear me?

573
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:12,064
杰克  你没事吧
Jack, you okay?

574
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,017
我没事
Yeah, i'm fine.

575
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,051
托尼  我们看到大楼外面有人来了
Okay, Tony, we're seeing new activity outside the building.

576
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:19,008
两辆车  8个敌人
Two vehicles, eight hostiles.

577
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:20,071
看起来像支安保小队
Looks like a security detail.

578
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,022
你觉得诺尔斯出卖他了吗
You think Knowles gave him up?

579
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:24,025
托尼  他们直奔你所在的入口了
Tony, they're moving straight for your point of entry.

580
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:31,002
8个敌人正向你方逼近
Eight hostiles and closing.

581
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,013
我听到他们的声音了
Yeah, i hear them.

582
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:33,023
你想要重新部署吗
You want to regroup?

583
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:36,016
不  我想赶快了结这件事
No, i want to get this over with.

584
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:39,046
安全  行动
Clear. Move.

585
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:49,014
安全  就是那里
Clear. Right there.

586
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,018
2号  3号  这里安全
Two three, we're clear.

587
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,053
我以前没在这见过你
I haven't seen you here before.

588
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:29,060
他们刚派了我们8个人过来
They just sent eight of us over here, sir.

589
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,026
为什么  出什么事了
Why, is something wrong?

590
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:34,077
没事  只是谨慎起见
No, sir. just, you know, precautions.

591
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,020
没错  没错  疑神疑鬼的还不够啊
Right, right. can't be paranoid enough.

592
00:28:45,095 --> 00:28:47,051
我在主楼
I'm in the main building.

595
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:53,014
你在平均海平面125英尺处
I've got you at 125 feet MSL,

596
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:55,042
大概是地下40英尺左右  对吗
Approximately 40 feet underground. is that correct?

597
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,042
对  我在地下四层
That's right. i'm four floors down.

598

关于那栋楼底下的情况
We've got no information on any kind of

599
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,013
我们一点信息都没有
subterranean floors in that building.

600
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,056
相信我  就在这里
Believe me, they're here.

环氧树脂加固墙  灌浇混凝土天花板
Epoxy-hardened walls, poured concrete ceilings.

602

603

是毒气罐
Okay, those are the canisters.

606
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:41,056
我去通知史密斯上将
I'll notify Admiral Smith

607

目标已找到并确认

608
00:29:43,077 --> 00:29:45,030
托尼  那就是毒气罐
Tony, those are the canisters.

609
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:49,071
杰克  看起来他们
Jack, it looks like they're transferring

610
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:51,033
正把毒气罐里的病原体
The pathogens from the canisters

611
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:53,028
转移到某种传输系统里
Into some sort of delivery system.

612
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:55,001
正在运送

收到  没关系

蕾妮正通过电话传送坐标

十分钟后那里的一切就灰飞烟灭了
Everything's gonna be dust in the next ten minutes.

正在撤退
Withdrawing.

618
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,013
好了  弟兄们
Okay, men.

619
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:27,001
乔纳斯  你怎么解释
You want to explain this, Jonas?

620
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:30,015
我被自己的安保人员拘捕
I'm arrested by our own security force.

621
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:32,066
像个犯人一样被关在自己的办公室里
Held captive in my own office like a prisoner.

622
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:35,099
甚至他们连我打电话给你
They won't allow me a phone call, even to you,

623
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:38,042
问问发生什么事了都不允许
To find out what the hell is going on!

624
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,099
抱怨还真不少呀  道格
Well, that's a lot of complaints, Doug.

625
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,056
说完了吗
You done?

626
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:46,053
你几个小时前就应该回家了
You were supposed to be home hours ago.

627
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,070
为什么有人看见你四处窥视呢
Why'd they find you snooping around?

628
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:51,037
我看到调查局突袭我们
I saw the FBI raid.

629
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:53,017
他们说我们持有生化武器
They say we have bioweapons.

630
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:58,024
他们根本没找到
Which they did not find.

631
00:30:58,031 --> 00:30:59,098
那不是重点
That's not the point.

632
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,085
是真的吗
Is it true?

633
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:06,055
记得我20年前第一次带你来这吗
Remember when I first brought you out here 20 years ago?

634
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:07,089
这里空无一物
There was nothing here.

635
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:09,082
什么也没有
Nothing.

636
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:11,072
我们在这片土地上  白手起家
And out of the damn mud,

637
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,042
建立起这家公司
We built this place,

638
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:17,056
组建起西半球乃至全世界最大的私人军队
The largest private army in the hemisphere, maybe the world,

639
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:21,030
一次又一次地拯救美国人民
And we pulled America's ass out of the fire

640
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:23,074
于水火之中
Again and again and again.

641
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,050
回答我的问题
Answer the question!

642
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:29,014
我正在回答你
I am.

643
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:32,038
每一天  我们都在做一些政府
Every day, we've done things

644
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:34,049
不能或是不愿意做的烂事
That the government itself could not or would not do.

645
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,072
他们就会说
"get this done,"

646
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:37,043
做好这件事  这是你们的任务
That's what they said, "here's your mission."

647
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:40,022
根本没人过问这些都是怎么完成的
Nobody asked how anything was gonna be done.

648
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:42,082
没有人关心
Nobody wanted to know.

649
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:47,009
每个人要的只是结果  我们给他们了
All anyone wanted was results, and we delivered.

650
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:48,093
没有人怀疑这一点
No one's questioning that.

651
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,080
没人怀疑吗
No one's questioning that?

652
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:52,070
你不是疯了吧
You're not insane, are you?

653
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,097
参议院  委员会  总统
The senate, the committees, the president.

654
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:58,087
华盛顿每一个喋喋不休的废物
Every chattering nonentity in washington

655
00:31:58,094 --> 00:32:01,021
总在那以那些个教条来吹毛求疵
Is out there with their standard operating procedures

656
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:04,035
说着  这怎么做的  那又是怎么做的
Saying, "how was this done? How was that done?"

657
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:08,078
每一个人都试图分裂我们  搞垮我们
Tearing at us, trying to bring us down, every one of them.

658
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:13,005
我使国家强盛安定
I kept this country strong. I kept it safe.

659
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:16,055
我不会为此而要受到迫害
And I will not be persecuted for that.

660
00:32:16,062 --> 00:32:20,086
乔纳斯  你不能对本该
Jonas, you cannot start a war against the people

661
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:22,046
保护的民众发动战争
You're supposed to protect.

662
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:25,053
双方已经开战  道格
We were at war, Doug,

663
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,010
从他们决定要解散我们的那一刻起就是了
The moment they decided to dismantle us.

664
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:30,084
关于那个武器
And as for particular weapons,

665
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,047
关于你的那个问题  我换个方式问吧
As for your question, let me rephrase it.

666
00:32:33,054 --> 00:32:36,041
我们准备好自卫反击了吗
Are we prepared to defend ourselves?

667
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:38,098
准备好了
We are.

668
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:41,005
乔纳斯
Jonas...

669
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:46,052
你不能和政府作对啊
You can't take on the federal government.

670
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:52,009
你从来就不是个从大处着想的人
Yeah, well, you never were one for thinking big.

671
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:54,099
20年来
20 years

672
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,010
我对你视如己出
I treated you like a son.

673
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,093
20年了
20 years.

674
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,007
你的那一点点忠心
A little loyalty...

675
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,020
我还是应得的吧
Wasn't that the least I deserved?

676
00:33:55,086 --> 00:33:57,026
请讲
Yes.

677
00:33:57,032 --> 00:34:00,089
我们有一个截击雷达系统发出警报
Sir, we just got an alert from one of our radar intercepts.

678
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:03,023
一支F-18飞行中队
There's a squadron of F-18's

679
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,066
从弗吉尼亚海滩向我方袭来
Heading our way out of Virginia beach.

680
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:07,087
先生
Sir?

681
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:09,020
什么时候到达
What's the ETA?

682
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:10,074
不到十分钟
Less than ten minutes.

683
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,007
-我们准备得怎么样了  -多少
- What's our readiness? - How many?

684
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:16,044
三个弹头已经装好
We have three loaded.

685
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:18,041
打电话给总统
Place the call to the president.

686
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:21,071
我马上就到
I'll be there momentarily.

687
00:34:39,095 --> 00:34:42,062
你现在大概觉得我是世上最烂的人渣了
You probably think I'm the scum of the earth right now.

688
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:48,089
我只关心你别把斯塔克伍德的事报导出去
All I care about is that you don't run the Starkwood story.

689
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:51,013
你还真是精神可嘉
You're a real sport.

690
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,040
牺牲小我为大我
Taking one for the team like this.

691
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,004
看着我
Look at me.

692
00:35:04,031 --> 00:35:07,034
你不会报导这件事的  对吧
You won't run it, right?

693
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:12,070
对不起  利维
I'm sorry, Livy.

694
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,043
什么
What?

695
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:18,006
我必须报导
I have to run it.

696
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:19,043
这么大的爆炸性新闻
Breaking something this big

697
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:21,026
会让我在纽约受万众瞩目
Will put me over the top in New York.

698
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:24,083
我保证没人会知道是你泄露的消息
I'll make sure nobody knows any of it came from you.

699
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,083
你这个撒谎的混蛋
You lying son of a bitch.

700
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,017
好了啦
Come on, please.

701
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,085
我所做的一切都是为了自己
I'm did what I needed to do

702
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,034
能飞黄腾达  就像你一样
to get ahead-- Just like you.

703
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,084
我们之间没有可比性
There's no comparison.

704
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,064
报导这件事会伤及整个国家
Running that story will harm the country.

705
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:40,064
我在华盛顿混的时间可比你长得多
I've been in Washington a lot longer than you.

706
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,035
你会明白  游戏就是这么玩的
You'll see, this is how the way the game is played.

707
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:46,058
肯  还是我教教你怎么玩吧
Actually, Ken, this is how the game is played.

708
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:50,065
什么意思
What do you mean?

709
00:36:06,077 --> 00:36:10,014
你报导这件事  或以后再试图敲诈我
You run that story, or ever try to blackmail me again,

710
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,088
我就会让所有人都知道
And I'll make sure everyone knows

711
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:14,001
你是怎么得来的线索
Just how you get your leads.

712
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:17,035
我觉得你夫人会非常感兴趣
I think your wife will be especially interested.

713
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,068
从你告诉我的事情来看
From everything you've told me,

714
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:22,013
那会是非常令人不快的离婚
That's gonna be one nasty divorce.

715
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,039
贱人
You bitch

716
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,072
找条新路吧  肯
Find a new beat, Ken.

717
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,086
我不想在白宫附近再见到你
I don't want to see you around the White House again.

718
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:35,027
抱歉  我要接这个电话
Sorry, I've got to take this.

719
00:36:45,054 --> 00:36:46,088
请讲
Hi.

720
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:48,058
你去哪了
Where in the world are you?

721
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:50,041
抱歉  我在K街有一个会面
I'm sorry. I had a meeting on K Street.

722
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,018
我必须要跟一个记者周旋
I had to run interference with a reporter.

723
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:53,092
媒体已经知道了吗
Are the press on to this?

724
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:55,049
没关系了  我搞定了
Not anymore. I took care of it.

725
00:36:55,055 --> 00:36:56,085
我需要你  利维
I need you here, Livy.

726
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:58,037
我们有了生化武器存在的证据
We've had confirmation on the bioweapons,

727
00:36:58,037 --> 00:37:00,039
现在正在施行空中打击
And the air strike is happening now.

728
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:01,079
五分钟后就到
I'll be there in five minutes.

729
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:15,048
上将  进展如何
Where are we, admiral?

730
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:16,087
F-18战斗机群已经装载上
The f-18's have been loaded with

731
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:18,008
激光制导掩体破坏弹
bunker-buster ordinance

732
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:21,004
7分钟之后便可到达射程
And will be in range in seven minutes.

733
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:24,045
病原体扩散到周边地区的几率有多大
What's the risk of the pathogen spreading to the surrounding areas?

734
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:25,088
最小限度
Minimal.

735
00:37:25,095 --> 00:37:27,035
我们用的是磷弹
We're using white phosphorous charges,

736
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:28,062
燃烧时可达5000摄氏度
Which burn at 5,000 degrees.

737
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:30,099
绝对可以完全摧毁病原体
More than enough to incinerate the pathogen.

738
00:37:31,006 --> 00:37:32,066
疾病控制中心确认这一点了吗
And that's been confirmed by the CDC.

739
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:34,029
是的
It has.

740
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:43,017
武器准备好了吗

00:37:43,023 --> 00:37:44,047

Yes, sir.

00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:48,061
给总统的电话呢

00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:50,077
正在打
The call is in process.

744
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:54,081
今天是个有历史意义的日子  先生们
It's an historic day, gentlemen.

745
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:56,098
对斯塔克伍德来说是个大日子

遗憾的是诺尔斯不能和我们共襄盛举了

753
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:34,066
总统阁下  指挥控制中心报告

755
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:37,085
在斯塔克伍德基地附近运行

756
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:40,032
什么意思
Meaning what exactly?

757
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:42,003
他们知道我们要来
They know we're coming.

758
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:46,023
有高射炮威胁的可能性吗
Is there any evidence of an antiaircraft artillery threat?

759
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:50,093
情报显示他们没有那种防空能力
Intelligence is indicating no such capability on the ground.

760
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,047
总统阁下  有您的电话
Madam president, there's a phone call for you.

761
00:38:53,054 --> 00:38:55,027
是乔纳斯·霍奇斯打来的
It's Jonas Hodges.

762
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:02,023
接到免提上
Put him on speaker.

763
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,058
阁下  他要求跟您私下谈
Ma'am, he's requested a private conversation.

764
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:08,018
他说在中控室设了一条专线
He says he's established a proprietary line in the ops room.

765
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:10,032
专线
A proprietary line?

766
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,089
他是怎么办到的
How did he manage that?

767
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:14,002
我不清楚
I have no idea.

768
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:42,022
请讲
Hello.

769
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:45,081
总统阁下  走到今天这一步
Madam president, let me begin by saying

770
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:47,042
请先让我表示诚挚的歉意
That I am truly sorry it's come to this.

771
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,042
但我还得强烈要求您
But I have to insist

772
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:51,080
最好赶快召回您的战斗机
you turn your planes around immediately.

773
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:55,080
你没资格发最后通牒  霍奇斯先生
You're in no position to issue ultimatums, Mr. Hodges.

774
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:58,060
或许我有
Well, maybe I am.

775
00:39:58,067 --> 00:40:01,067
总统阁下  记得几年前
You remember several years ago, Madam President,

776
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:04,031
斯塔克伍德驻扎在巴基斯坦
Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan.

777
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:06,038
印象深刻
Oh, I remember it very well.

778
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:07,081
我反对那次部署
I fought that deployment.

779
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:09,031
结果您输了
And you lost.

780
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:10,061
您应该也还记得
You'll also recall

781
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:13,058
那时我们征用过的导弹系统
That we requisitioned a missile system at that time--

782
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:15,012
巨蟒五号
Python fives.

783
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:16,065
三枚那样的导弹
Well, three of those missiles

784
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:18,009
现正装满病原体
Are now loaded with the pathogen

785
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:21,019
对准我国东海岸
And aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard.

786
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,056
你在虚张声势
You're bluffing.

787
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:30,017
为了表示诚意
As a sign of good faith,

788
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:34,047
我让您见识下  证明我并非虚张声势
I'm willing to show you that i'm... that i'm not bluffing.

789
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:39,098
看见了吗
You see that?

790
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,028
总统阁下
Madam president?

791
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,052
这就是你表示诚意的方式吗
You call this good faith?

792
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:54,079
你是要对自己国家开战啊  乔纳斯
You are waging war on your own country, Jonas.

793
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:57,036
当然了  我可不这么想
Well, of course, I wouldn't see it that way.

794
00:40:57,043 --> 00:41:00,096
你到底想怎样
What do you want?

795
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:06,007
一会到了白宫我们再谈
Well, we can have that conversation a little later on at the White House.

796
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:09,057
你觉得我们能这么坐下来谈吗
You think we're going to just sit down and discuss this?

797
00:41:09,064 --> 00:41:11,094
是的  就在您的总统办公室里
Yes i do, in the Oval Office,

798
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:14,061
我们私下谈  一个小时之内
In confidence, within the hour.

799
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:17,088
但同时  我觉得
But in the meantime, I think it is

800
00:41:17,095 --> 00:41:19,005
美国人民不知道
To both of our advantage

801
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:21,025
你我相持不下的局面
That the American people do not know

802
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:23,055
对我们两个都有好处
The exact circumstance of this stand off.

803
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:26,089
所以您要对此次会晤守口如瓶
So you will keep this conversation to yourself,

804
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:28,012
并且召回战斗机
And turn the planes around.

805
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,099
您要是不答应的话  总统阁下
And if you don't comply, Madam President,

806
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:35,033
我就别无选择  只能发射那些导弹
I will have no choice but to launch those missiles.

807
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,080
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges...

808
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:41,087
记住  你对我方的一举一动
And remember, i can detect any action you take

809
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:43,034
都在我的监视之下
Against our facility.

810
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,071
你有30秒
You have 30 seconds.

811
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:48,031
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges...

812
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,015
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges!

813
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:20,041
史密斯上将  取消空袭
Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith.

814
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,061
总统阁下
Madam president...

815
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:24,005
照做就是了
Just do as I say.

816
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:30,062
阁下  恕我直言
Ma'am, with all respect...

817
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:33,066
见鬼  上将  马上取消空袭
Damn it, admiral, abort the air strike immediately!

818
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:36,003
我是史密斯上将

819
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:37,079

00:42:52,058 --> 00:42:55,034
攻击取消了  总统阁下
We're standing down, Madam President.
