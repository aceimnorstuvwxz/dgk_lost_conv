1
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,096
《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

2
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:19,035
不
No!

3
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,070
先生  是参议员迈尔
Sir,it's senator Mayer.

4
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:23,069
他遇害了
He is dead.

5
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:24,097
你是说  杰克·鲍尔
Are you telling me that Jack Bauer

6
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:27,043
杀了一位美国议员吗
just killed a united states senator?

7
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:28,086
你们怎么能让这种事发生
How could you have let this happen?!

8
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:31,013
卡宁先生  你别把这一切都怪在我头上
Mr. Kanin,you are not going to lay this one at my feet.

9
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:33,064
怎么了  伊桑  出什么事了
What is it,Ethan,what's wrong?

10
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:35,027
总统阁下  恐怕我别无选择
Madam president,i'm afraid i have no choice

11
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:37,047
只能辞去联席参谋长一职了
But to resign as your chief of staff.

12
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:39,064
你想的太多了
You're taking this too far.

13
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:40,071
杰克在哪
Where is Jack?

14
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:42,062
我们没有抓到他
We don't have him.

15
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:45,020
陷害鲍尔谋杀了伯内特的人叫约翰·奎恩
The man who framed Jack for Burnett's murder was John Quinn,

16
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:47,065
他是斯塔克伍德的一名雇佣兵
a Starkwood contractor.

17
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:49,099
杰克到迈尔那边取证
Jack went to Mayer to get the evidence to prove it.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,022
斯塔克伍德和今天
Starkwood was involved with everything

19
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,065
发生的一切都有关联
That's happened today. they were the ones

20
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:55,069
是他们协助朱玛一伙撞毁飞机并袭击白宫
That helped Juma and his men bring down the plane and attack the White House.

21
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,052
作为交换  他们获准在桑加拉
In exchange,they were allowed to develop

22
00:00:57,053 --> 00:00:59,076
研发并生产大规模杀伤性武器
And manufacture a WMD in Sangala.

23
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:02,043
我从他们手下的手机里获取的短信
The text message i got off their agent's cell phone

24
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:05,077
显示  "亚历山大港  晚上10点50分"
Said "port of Alexandria, 10：50 p.m."

25
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:08,051
-警报  警报  -打  打
- Go red,go red! - Engage,engage.

26
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,011
快把车开走
Get that truck out of here now!

27
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,062
托尼  我去追卡车
Tony! the truck-- I'm going after it!

28
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:22,006
掩护我
Cover me now!

29
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:34,024
我这有在亚历山大港
I'm in possession of a biological weapon

30
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:36,073
截获的生化武器
Interdicted at the port of alexandria.

31
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:53,045
你那边情况如何
What's your status?

32
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,078
武器到手了  我们在返回途中
Package is secure; we're inbound.

33
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,010
鲍尔呢
What about Bauer?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,032
但他躲到了附近的掩体
But he sought cover nearby.

35
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,079
我们得假定他通知了当局
We have to assume that he contacted the authorities,

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,009
我们要加快进度了
So we'd better be on an accelerated timetable.

37
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,063
快过来
Get over here.

38
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:06,033
斯塔克伍德重新夺回了生化武器
Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon.

39
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,006
并把武器空运走了
They airlifted the freight right out of here.

40
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,000
他们从我这的位置往正西方走了
They were headed due west from my current position.

41
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,043
杰克  我不能攻击私人领地
Jack,i can't assault a private compound

42
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:13,093
除非我有他们持有生化武器的证据
Unless i have proof that a weapon exists.

43
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:14,089
好吧  疾病控制中心的人呢
Okay,where is the CDC?

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,014
他们在紧急召集一队人马
They're scrambling a team right now.

45
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:17,021
把他们派到我这来
Send them to me.

46
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:19,027
这有你要的证据
You'll have all the proof you need.

47
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:22,045
我暴露其中了
I was exposed.

48
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:27,072
以下情节发生在晚间11点至12点间
The following takes place between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m.

49
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,018
我们准备好了  先生  跟我来
We're ready for you,sir,come with me.

50
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,061
鲍尔先生
Mr. Bauer.

51
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:58,045
我是梅瑟尔医生  疾病控制中心的
Dr. Macer,CDC.

52
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,056
请你把衣服脱掉
We need you to get undressed.

53
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:05,072
你就是那位跟莫斯沟通过的人吧
You're the one that talked to agent Moss?

54
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:07,002
他跟我说了你的情况
He brought me up to speed,

55
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,082
说你掌握了有关生化武器的线索
Said you had some information about the bioweapon.

56
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,036
我只知道武器在桑加拉开发
All i know is that it was developed in Sangala,

57
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:14,053
据村子里的传闻说  武器正在实验
And according to rumors from the village that it was tested on,

58
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:17,012
所有的受害者都得了痴呆症或者瘫痪
All the victims suffered from dementia and paralysis.

59
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,022
检查神经媒介物和病原体
Check neurological vectors and pathogens.

60
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:20,064
泄露了多少
How much was released?

61
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:23,017
具体不清楚
I'm not exactly sure.

62
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:25,065
武器都储存在加压罐里
The weapon was stored in a pressurized canister.

63
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:27,001
在我封闭它之前
It was breached for maybe two minutes

64
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:28,062
大概泄露了2分钟
Before i could seal it off.

65
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:36,072
这不是感染后反应
This is not a reaction.

66
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:38,004
这是以前的旧伤疤
I've had these scars.

67
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:40,088
这是一种全谱抗生素
This is a full spectrum antibiotic.

68
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:43,053
它可以抑制各种已知的病原体
It should counteract a wide range of known pathogens.

69
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,067
走到这里来  先生
Step inside,sir.

70
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,098
抬起胳膊  闭上眼
Raise your arms and close your eyes.

71
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,072
詹尼斯  进展怎么样
Janis,where are we?

72
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:13,066
首府警局关闭了236高速6英里长的范围
Metro closed down a six-mile stretch of highway 236.

73
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:15,059
疾病控制中心第一反应小组到达了现场
The CDC first responders are on-site.

74
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,036
-到底怎么回事  -有一罐生化武器泄露了
- What the hell's going on? - One of the bioweapon canisters was breached.

75
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:20,084
杰克可能已被感染了
Jack may have been exposed.

76
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:23,046
-天哪  -斯塔克伍德拿走了毒气罐
- Oh,my god. - Starkwood took the canisters.

77
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,097
他们可能带着托尼·阿尔梅达和武器
They're probably flying it back to their main compound

78
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,020
一起飞回到位于弗吉尼亚的总部了
In Virginia,along with Tony Almeida.

79
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:29,041
-阿尔梅达  -对  他和杰克一起干
- Almeida? - Yeah,he was working with Jack.

80
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,057
我们估计他已被扣为人质了
We think he might have been taken captive.

81
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:32,033
等一下  我要你做一份
Hang on one second. i need you to put together

82
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:33,076
有关斯达克伍德的简报
A briefing packet on Starkwood.

83
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:35,020
我要每个部门都明白
I want every division caught up to speed

84
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,081
我们在跟什么人物较量
On what we might be dealing with.

85
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:37,089
你要对斯塔克伍德采取行动吗
You planning to move on Starkwood?

86
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,054
那地方太大了  实际上就是个军事基地
That place is enormous; it's practically a military base.

87
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,011
在疾病控制中心给出确凿证据前
We're not going to do anything till we have concrete evidence

88
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,051
我们不会采取任何行动的
on the bioweapon from CDC.

89
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:45,007
然后我会请示总统
Then i'll inform the president.

90
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:46,050
由她决定如何行事
She'll decide how to proceed.

91
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:29,083
阿尔梅达不会开口的
Almeida's not going to talk.

92
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:31,087
他不是孬种  他是个硬汉
He's not the type; he's the brave type.

93
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:34,067
知己知彼  百战不殆
Know the psychology of your subject.

94
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,064
这是我们的行事准则
That's in our manual.

95
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:39,065
走吧
Here we go.

96
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:46,085
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges,

97
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:49,038
我们已经把泄露的罐子隔离开了
We isolated the damaged canister.

98
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,092
很走运
We got lucky.

99
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:52,052
他们知道我们手上有武器
They know we have the weapons.

100
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,069
这就糟糕了
That's not so lucky.

101
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,092
多久能准备就绪
How fast can you have them ready?

102
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:56,093
至少得2小时
It's going to take me at least two hours.

103
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:58,073
-太久了  汤姆  -先生  我们还不知道
- Too long,Tom. - Sir,we don't know

104
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,080
政府掌握了多少
What the government knows.

105
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,016
他们正在行动  而且会
They're coming,and they'll be coming

106
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,067
拿着所掌握的证据找上门来
With everything they've got,

107
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:05,004
唯一能制止他们的办法
and the only thing that's going to stop them

108
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:07,027
就是部署好这些武器
is getting these weapons ready to deploy.

109
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:09,074
是的  先生  我会尽全力
Yes,sir,i'll do my best.

110
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:12,065
我知道你会的
I know you will.

111
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,059
好了  出发
Okay,let's go!

112
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:37,033
联邦调查局都知道什么
What does the FBI know?

113
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:39,028
我不会再跟你啰嗦
I'm not going to ask you again.

114
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:48,005
好了
Okay.

115
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,049
你是好样的  托尼
You're a good man,Tony.

116
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:56,028
我知道你的背景
I know your profile.

117
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,015
我知道你难对付
You've had some hard breaks.

118
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:02,002
我也不想伤害你
I don't want to see you hurt,

119
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,093
所以你只要告诉我联邦调查局
So you just tell me what the FBI knows

120
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:07,040
掌握了多少我们的情况
About what we're doing here,

121
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,080
我不能保证你会笑着走出去
And i can't say you'll walk away smiling--

122
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:11,093
那是不现实的
That would be unrealistic--

123
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:16,053
但我会给你一条生路
But you'll be alive.

124
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,089
听清楚了吗
You hear me?

125
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:31,093
可我什么也不知道  霍奇斯先生
But i don't know anything,Mr. Hodges.

126
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:46,023
我是在给你机会  托尼
I'm giving you a way out,Tony.

127
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:48,034
先生
Sir,

128
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,072
我能跟你说两句吗
May i speak to you for a moment?

129
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:52,081
现在不行  格雷格
Not now,Greg.

130
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:55,095
拜托了  先生  就一会儿
Please,sir, Just for a moment.

131
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,046
什么事
What is it?

132
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,063
这本该是一次秘密行动
This was supposed to be a covert operation.

133
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:11,019
现在已经变样了
That is not the case anymore

134
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,016
政府已经知道我们拥有这些武器
The government knows that we have these weapons,

135
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:15,074
他们是不会不闻不问的
And they're not just going to sit on that information.

136
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:19,043
你怎么看  格雷格
What are you suggesting,Greg?

137
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:22,070
也许我们应该趁还来得及
Maybe we should destroy the evidence

138
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:24,091
把证据都销毁
While we still have some time.

139
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,054
真不敢相信
I can't believe

140
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:30,025
这话是从你嘴里说出来的
That i'm hearing this from you.

141
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,005
我只想帮把手  先生
I'm just trying to help,sir.

142
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:33,078
我跟你一样在乎这个公司
I care about this company as much as you do.

143
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,035
我深表怀疑
Oh,i doubt that.

144
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:38,095
为了得到这些武器  我们已经付出了
We've invested a lot of blood and treasure

145
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:41,032
太多金钱和血的代价
To get these weapons,

146
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,073
我是不会罢手的
And i'm not going to give them up.

147
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:45,066
想想你冒的风险  先生
Think about what you're risking,sir--

148
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:48,073
一切  所有你打下的江山
Everything,everything you've built.

149
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:50,047
你说你是要帮忙
You say you're trying to help.

150
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:52,017
知道我怎么想吗
You know what i think?

151
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,090
我看你就只担心自己的小命
I think you're worried about your own ass.

152
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:57,017
把他带出去  该用刑时就用刑
Get him out of here and do what you have to do.

153
00:08:57,018 --> 00:09:00,008
小伙子  想想我跟你说的话
Think about what i said,young man.

154
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,066
你有点紧张了  格雷格
You're a little nervous,Greg.

155
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,095
我有条大新闻透露给你
Well, I've got a news flash.

156
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:04,011
其实我们都紧张
We're all nervous.

157
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:05,091
省省你那点优柔寡断吧
Keep your doubts to yourself.

158
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:08,076
不用我再提醒你了
I'm not going to tell you again.

159
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,089
我们要提取更多的血液和唾液样本
We're going to need to take more blood and saliva samples,

160
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,032
还要收集脑脊液样本
And i'd like to collect a spinal fluid specimen.

161
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:18,096
在我们得出结论之前  你必须被隔离
Until we know what we're dealing with, we need to keep you under quarantine.

162
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:21,040
还要多久才能知道  我有没有被感染
How long is it gonna be till you know whether or not I've been infected?

163
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,027
初步结果应该会在15分钟后出来
We should have the preliminary results in the next 15 minutes.

164
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:26,058
-好的  -梅瑟尔医生
- Okay. - Dr. Macer,

165
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,094
我们在空气中监测到微量病原体
We've detected trace amounts of an airborne pathogen.

166
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:30,061
主要集中在卡车附近
It's concentrated near the truck.

167
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,014
在周围环境中也有发现
We're also picking it up in the surrounding environments

168
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,044
但是浓度很低
At much lower concentrations.

169
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:34,054
能确定是什么物质吗
Can you identify it?

170
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:36,038
还不能  但我们正在分析样本
No,but we're analyzing a sample now.

171
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,095
这种小程度的扩散应该不会
These levels shouldn't present any danger

172
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:39,015
威胁到附近的人群
To the nearby population,

173
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:41,056
但还是要对大气实施监控
But I still want atmospheric monitors set up.

174
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:44,035
鲍尔先生  你封闭毒气罐真是太明智了
It's a good thing you sealed off the canister,Mr. Bauer.

175
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,035
你救了很多人的命
You saved a lot of lives.

176
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,042
还要麻烦你们把我送回调查局
You're going to have to transport me back to FBI.

177
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:50,099
我还是目前恐怖袭击的关键人证
I'm still material evidence in an ongoing terrorist threat.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,019
这正是我们的使命  那边也能进行检测
Those were our orders. We can run our tests from there.

179
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,027
好的
Okay.

180
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,070
鲍勃·杰斯曼在过去3年
Bob Justman's been associate counsel

181
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:03,042
一直是助理咨询顾问
For the past three years.

182
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,076
他和伊桑在工作上关系很密切
He and Ethan worked very closely together.

183
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:08,051
担当联席参谋长他肯定够格
He is certainly qualified to be chief of staff.

184
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:10,044
但是
But

185
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:13,015
经过今天的事
After what's happened today,

186
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:15,040
我觉得你应把眼光放到内阁成员之外
I think you should be looking outside your administration.

187
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,096
内部成员能助我一臂之力
An insider has a leg up.

188
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:21,012
联席参谋长可是个极富挑战的职位
Chief of staff has a steep learning curve.

189
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:26,003
我觉得你是低估了新视角的价值
I think you're underestimating the value of a fresh perspective.

190
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:28,025
你心中已有人选了吧
You have someone in mind.

191
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:30,013
是的
I do.

192
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,068
瑞克·伯曼
Rick Berman.

193
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:37,075
瑞克会考虑离开他自己的私营企业吗
Would Rick even consider leaving the private sector?

194
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:39,023
他已经赚了很多钱了
Well,he's made his fortune.

195
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:41,025
我想他现在很想找个机会为国效力
I think he'd jump at the chance to serve his country.

196
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:42,095
我们找他谈谈吧
Let's sit down with him.

197
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:43,064
好啊
Great.

198
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:45,043
不过还是要再考虑一下鲍勃
But keep Bob on the list.

199
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,062
我仍觉得他是不错的人选
I still have a good feeling about him.

200
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,066
我明天就去安排会面
I'll start to set up meetings Tomorrow.

201
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:55,043
利维  想找能接替伊桑的人恐怕还要几周
Livy,it could take weeks to find Ethan's replacement.

202
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:57,093
在这段时间里
In the meantime,

203
00:10:57,094 --> 00:11:01,010
我还需要一个代理参谋长
I'm going to need a provisional chief of staff.

204
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:03,034
我想任命你
I'd like that to be you.

205
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,074
什么事
Yes?

206
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:11,087
-蒂姆·伍兹要见您  -过几分钟之后
- Tim Woods is here to see you. - Just give me a minute,please.

207
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,096
-再让他进来 -是  阁下
- And then send him in. - yes ma’am.

208
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:17,019
利维  我需要一个可以信得过的人
Livy,I need someone I can trust.

209
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,065
特别是经历过今天发生的种种后
Especially after everything that's happened today.

210
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:24,008
你不会拒绝你的母亲的  对吧
You're not going to say "no" to your mother,are you?

211
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,033
当然不会
Of course not.

212
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,033
很好
Good.

213
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:33,039
总统阁下  调查局的拉里·莫斯
Madam president,I have Larry Moss

214
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,006
有电话找您
At FBI calling for you.

215
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:36,020
他有什么事
What's this about?

216
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:37,067
具体情况我也不知道
I don't know the specifics,

217
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:40,051
但他说是事关即将威胁国家安全的紧急事件
But he says it involves an imminent homeland threat.

218
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,055
接进来
Put him through.

219
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:44,091
没关系的  蒂姆
It's all right,Tim.

220
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:48,038
我刚任命奥利维亚为代理参谋长
I've made Olivia acting chief of staff.

221
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,088
莫斯探员  请讲
Agent Moss,you're on with the president.

222
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,055
总统阁下  我们取得了一些进展
Madam president,we have a situation developing.

223
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:56,098
首先  杰克·鲍尔没有杀
First of all,you need to know that Jack Bauer

224
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:59,072
莱恩·伯内特和参议员布莱恩·迈尔
Did not kill Ryan Burnett nor Senator Blaine Mayer.

225
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:00,092
他是被陷害的
He was framed for their murders.

226
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,006
我就知道是这样
I knew it.

227
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,016
-是谁干的  -根据我们的战术推断
- Who framed him?  - Our operational theory

228
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:06,036
他是被斯塔克伍德公司设计陷害的
Is that he was set up by Starkwood.

229
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,086
我不明白  为什么他们要栽赃嫁祸于杰克
I don't understand. why would Starkwood frame Jack?

230
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:11,053
他们是企图掩盖曾经协助朱玛
To cover up the fact that they helped Juma stage

231
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:13,023
策划了今天的恐怖袭击一事
The terrorist attacks today.

232
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,044
什么
What?

233
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:15,074
阁下  我们有证据表明
Ma'am,we have evidence

234
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:17,041
斯塔克伍德曾向朱玛
That Starkwood provided Juma

235
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:19,021
提供技术支持和内部情报
With technological support and intelligence.

236
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,084
而作为回报  朱玛允许他们在桑加拉
And in return,Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala

237
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:23,078
建设实验基地
As a base to operate without having

238
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,098
而且不用担心受到监管
To worry about any oversight.

239
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,068
作为什么的基地
A base for what?

240
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:29,002
制造大规模杀伤性武器
To manufacture weapons of mass destruction.

241
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:32,063
确切地说  是生化武器
Specifically,biological weapons.

242
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:45,027
你说的是哪种生化武器
What kind of bioweapons are you talking about?

243
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,080
我们还不确定  很可能是
We're not sure,but it could be

244
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,087
某种神经性病原体
Some kind of neurological pathogen.

245
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:51,087
疾病控制中心已拿到样本正在进行分析
CDC has obtained a sample and they're analyzing it now.

246
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,051
莫斯探员  你刚说有威胁正在逼近
Agent Moss,you said there was an imminent threat.

247
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,021
是的  一批生化武器
Yes,a large shipment of bioweapons

248
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,035
已经交货给了斯塔克伍德
Was delivered to Starkwood.

249
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,061
我们认为他们现在持有这些武器
We believe they're in possession of them now.

250
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:00,028
你是说这些武器就在美国本土吗
Are you saying these weapons are on U.S. soil?

251
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,078
我们猜测这些武器就在
We suspect they're at the Starkwood

252
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,098
斯塔克伍德的弗吉尼亚总部
Headquarters in Virginia.

253
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:04,062
你不认为斯塔克伍德
You're not suggesting that Starkwood

254
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,046
会使用这些武器来攻击我们的国家吗
Intends to use those weapons to attack this country?

255
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:10,033
还不清楚  但照他们今天的行动来看
We don't know,but,given their actions today,

256
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:13,056
我们必须马上对斯塔克伍德采取措施
We need to move on Starkwood immediately.

257
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,057
总统阁下
Madam President?

258
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:22,007
召集内阁成员和联席参谋长们
Assemble the cabinet and the joint chiefs.

259
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:24,025
是的  阁下
Yes,ma'am.

260
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,000
杰克是对的  斯塔克伍德的确有问题
Jack was right about Starkwood.

261
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,080
你也找到了他们协助朱玛的证据了吧
You found evidence that they've been supporting Juma.

262
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,047
是的
Yeah.

263
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:54,003
查出动机了吗
Did you find out why?

264
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:55,090
我是说  他们能从朱玛那捞到什么好处呢
I mean,what could Starkwood possibly get from Juma?

265
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:58,037
开发和测试生化武器的基础设施
The infrastructure to develop and test biological weapons.

266
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,000
我们认为这些武器就藏匿在
We think they're holding them somewhere

267
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,077
斯塔克伍德军事基地里
On the Starkwood compound.

268
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:03,062
好吧  杰克在哪
Okay,where's Jack?

269
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:07,065
在来调查局的路上
He's on his way over here.

270
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:11,032
怎么了  拉里
What,Larry?

271
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:16,059
他试图保护武器不被夺走  但
He managed to secure the weapons,but then,uh,

272
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,069
斯塔克伍德还是抢了回去
Starkwood got them back.

273
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,010
而与此同时
And when that happened,um...

274
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:26,086
杰克暴露在毒气中
Jack was exposed.

275
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:28,003
他可能被感染了
He may have been infected.

276
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:29,080
现正被隔离着
He's being placed under quarantine.

277
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:32,027
他在来这的路上  我们要让他说出
Listen,he's on his way here and we need to find out

278
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:34,014
他知道的所有关于这些武器的事
Everything that he learned about these weapons.

279
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,098
我想应该由你来给他做笔录
And I think you should be the one who debriefs him.

280
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:43,005
还有  我要向你道歉
And I owe you an apology.

281
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,098
我不该不信任你
I was wrong not to trust you,

282
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:49,065
我  我被自己对鲍尔的偏见蒙蔽了双眼
And I-I let my prejudice about Bauer get in the way.

283
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:52,039
但是
But

284
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,060
蕾妮  你也不该瞒着我
Renee,you should've kept me in the loop.

285
00:14:57,061 --> 00:15:00,001
你应该相信我
You should've trusted me.

286
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:05,075
我知道
I know.

287
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:08,055
我是该相信你
I should have.

288
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:18,022
我们什么时候开始对斯塔克伍德采取行动
When are we moving on Starkwood?

289
00:15:20,026 --> 00:15:22,029
亚伦
Aaron?

290
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,095
我待会儿再找你们办登记  好吗
I'll check in with you guys later,okay?

291
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:26,007
谢谢
Thank you.

292
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,033
我能跟你谈一谈吗
May I speak with you for a moment?

293
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:31,013
当然可以  我听说你
Of course. I heard you finished

294
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,093
已经做好笔录准备离开了
Your debrief and were on your way out.

295
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:34,026
是的  女士
Yes,ma'am.

296
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:36,043
我要你留下来
Well,I need you to stay.

297
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:37,080
什么
Ma'am?

298
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:40,064
我被任命为代理联席参谋长
I've been appointed acting chief of staff.

299
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,044
特勤组要安排一个探员
Secret service is going to assign an agent

300
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:45,011
负责我的安全事宜
To handle my security detail.

301
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,085
我希望由你来担此重任
I'd like that to be you.

302
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,038
真是非常荣幸  女士
Well,I'm truly flattered,ma'am,

303
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,032
但是你知道  我已经告老还乡了
But as you know,I'm retired.

304
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,012
我可以让你官复原职
I can have you reinstated.

305
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:58,048
还有大把大把的优秀的探员任你挑选
There are plenty of fine agents on the roster.

306
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:59,019
但我不想要他们
But I don't want them.

307
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,027
我只想用你
I want you.

308
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,063
我现在不能透露太多细节
I can't go into the details now,

309
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:07,013
但是对我们国家的威胁还远没有结束
But the threat to this country isn't over.

310
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,017
我们仍身处危机之中
We're in the middle of a crisis,

311
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,051
我需要信得过的人在我身边
And I need people around me I can trust.

312
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,024
我信任你  亚伦
I trust you,Aaron.

313
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,081
我不轻易对别人说这句话
I can't say that about a lot of people.

314
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:20,059
我马上还要参加总统的会议
I'm running into a meeting with the president.

315
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,012
姑且先认为你答应了
I'll assume your answer is "yes."

316
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:35,002
先生们  女士们  请就座
Gentlemen,ladies,please take your seats.

317
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:36,037
是  阁下
Yes ma'am

318
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:43,013
现在谁还没有读完简报的
Now,those of you who haven't had a chance to finish your briefing packets,

319
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:45,044
请继续
Please keep reading.

320
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,011
我们也是刚刚得知
As we've all just learned,

321
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,028
惊心动魄的一天还没有结束
This day is not over.

322
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,075
国家安全依然受到威胁
Our national security is still being threatened,

323
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:58,025
召集大家来是要考虑一下我们能做的选择
And we are here to consider our options.

324
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:59,075
伍兹先生
Mr. Woods.

325
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:01,045
各位的简报材料中
Your briefing materials

326
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:03,055
包括联邦调查局得到的一份情报
Include FBI intelligence about a cache

327
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:06,036
称生化武器藏匿在斯塔克伍德
Of biological weapons on Starkwood's main compound

328
00:17:06,037 --> 00:17:07,076
位于北弗吉尼亚州的总部里
In northern Virginia.

329
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:10,049
这是该基地的近期卫星图像
This is a recent satellite view of the compound.

330
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,036
面积超过3平方英里  259个建筑物
Over three square miles,259 structures--

331
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:15,070
武器可能藏在那的任何地方
The weapons could be hidden anywhere on the facility.

332
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:18,041
是什么样的生化武器
What kind of bioweapons are we talking about?

333
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:21,071
这位是本·兰德利  疾病控制中心主任
This is ben landry,he's director of CDC.

334
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:23,051
他将就有关病原体的问题
He's here to answer any questions you may have

335
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:24,071
作出回答  本  请说吧
In regards to the pathogen. Ben.

336
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:27,028
我刚从外勤探员那里
I've just received a preliminary report

337
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,061
收到一份初步报告
From our agents in the field.

338
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:31,031
经他们鉴定  该病原体为朊病毒变体
They've identified the pathogen as a prion variant

339
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:33,045
是刚果东部特有的一种病毒
Indigenous to the east congo.

340
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:36,002
是克雅氏病症的一种形式
It's a form of creutzfeldt-jakob disease.

341
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:37,096
该病毒会侵染大脑和神经系统
It attacks the brain and the nervous system,

342
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,022
造成痴呆  体质下降
Causes dementia,physical deterioration,

343
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,089
并最终死亡
Ultimately death.

344
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,086
未变异的克雅氏病毒会在几个月内致死
Standard CJD kills within several months,

345
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:46,020
但这一变种致死速度更快
But this strain kills more quickly.

346
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:47,050
多久
How long?

347
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,087
一天  或许两天
A day,maybe two.

348
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:51,006
目前该疾病是不治之症  无药可医
There's no treatment for this disease. There's no cure.

349
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,007
若扩散到人口稠密的地区
If dispersed over a populated area,

350
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,054
后果将是灾难性的
The results would be catastrophic.

351
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:56,084
但不用我多说
But it goes without saying

352
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:59,048
我们绝不允许私人武装力量
We cannot allow a private military force,

353
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:02,058
这些刽子手们  拥有大规模杀伤性武器
These killers,to possess weapons of mass destruction.

354
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,048
我们要找到这些武器
We need to find these weapons,

355
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,098
逮捕斯塔克伍德的那群混蛋
And arrest those bastards in Starkwood

356
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:09,063
是他们把生化武器带到这里来了
Who are responsible for bringing them here.

357
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:12,036
总统阁下
Madam president.

358
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:17,039
考虑到基地的大小  我们将
Given the size of the compound,it would take

359
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,060
花费大量兵力去找出武器的位置
A considerable force to locate these weapons.

360
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:21,026
更不用提那里还有
Not to mention the fact that

361
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:25,024
1500名训练有素的雇佣兵
there are 1,500 highly-trained mercenaries on that base.

362
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:27,044
但愿他们不会武力抵抗
God forbid they decide to resist.

363
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:30,075
但愿不必后院起火  硝烟四起
We could have a small war in our own backyard.

364
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:33,054
总统阁下  我同意上述观点
I share those concerns,madam president.

365
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,068
我们也应该考虑到
We also have to consider the possibility

366
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:39,028
对方有使用生化武器对抗我们的可能性
That Starkwood might use these biological weapons against our own forces.

367
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:41,026
用空中打击如何
What about an air strike?

368
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,026
打击如此大规模的设施需要反复轰炸
A facility that large would require multiple bombing runs.

369
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:48,043
这就可能造成该基地内伤亡惨重
We'd be looking at massive casualties on the Starkwood base,

370
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,040
却不能确保是否能摧毁那批武器
With no guarantee of destroying the bioweapons.

371
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,046
据我们所知  武器可能埋在地下
For all we know, they've been buried underground

372
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,076
或者藏在加强型防御工事里
Or in fortified facilities.

373
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:56,007
如果打击力量不够强
There's also a risk that hitting these weapons

374
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:57,067
也有可能会造成那些生化剂
With insufficient force could release the bio-agent

375
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,090
被释放进大气里
Into the atmosphere.

376
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:00,087
我们不能无视法律
We can't just ignore the law here.

377
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:03,003
前面提到的所有方案
All these scenarios would be in violation

378
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,064
都有可能触犯了警卫团法案
Of the posse comitatus act.

379
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:08,048
我的意思是  我们不能
I mean,we can't deploy military personnel

380
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,065
在国会没有同意的情况下
In a law enforcement capacity.

381
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:14,005
以执法部门的名义部署武装人员
Not without congressional approval.

382
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:15,025
我听到的是
What i'm hearing

383
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:18,092
我们没有好的选择
Is that there are no good options.

384
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:21,043
我无法接受
I don't accept that.

385
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,010
除非我们找到控制这次危机的方法
Until we find a way to contain this threat,

386
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:28,033
否则我们的国家可能会遭遇另一次袭击
We are risking another attack on this country.

387
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,074
而我是不会考虑这样的选择的
And that is an option i won't consider.

388
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,067
霍奇斯先生想知道
Mr. Hodges wants to know

389
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:40,055
你有没有考虑过他的提议
If you've given any thought to his offer.

390
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:47,016
为什么你还要对一个背弃你的政府效忠呢
Why this loyalty to a government that screwed you over?

391
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,062
我搞不懂
I don't get it.

392
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,092
只要你告诉我们
Just tell us

393
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:53,057
调查局了解的情况  你就可以走了
What the FBI knows and you can walk.

394
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,036
告诉你吧
For the record,

395
00:19:59,037 --> 00:20:01,036
我跟霍奇斯先生打赌你不会开口
I bet Mr. Hodges a pair of redskins tickets

396
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:04,024
赌注就是华盛顿红皮队的两张球票
You wouldn't talk.

397
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,037
看来离赛场仅50码距离的
Looks like i'm going to be sitting

398
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,035
好座位非我莫属了
On the 50 yard line.

399
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:21,013
到底发生什么事了
Hey,what the hell's going on?

400
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:25,029
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

401
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,006
我的帮助
My help?

402
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,019
我们得阻止这一切  事情进行得太过了
We need to stop this. it's gone too far.

403
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,040
除非你告诉我你为什么这么干
Look,i'm not going anywhere

404
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,037
否则我哪都不去
Until you tell me why you're doing this.

405
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:42,041
我不想因为乔纳斯·霍奇斯的疯狂行为
I'm not spending the rest of my life

406
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,088
而在监狱里过下半辈子
In prison because Jonas Hodges has lost his mind.

407
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,054
你知道武器在哪里吗
You know where the weapons are?

408
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:47,088
是的
Yes.

409
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,071
你最好现在就告诉我
Then you better tell me right now.

410
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:51,055
我想要豁免权
I want immunity.

411
00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:53,082
听着  我无法给你承诺什么
Look,i can't promise you anything.

412
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,009
但我们可以给调查局打电话做笔交易
We can call the FBI and negotiate a deal,

413
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,035
他们给你豁免权
Immunity in exchange for your help

414
00:20:57,036 --> 00:21:00,057
你就帮他们找到武器  我只能做这么多
In recovering the weapons,that's the best i can do.

415
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,059
我可以在我办公室里建立安全线路
I can set up a secure landline in my office.

416
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,034
好  走吧
Good,let's go.

417
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:18,034
我们现在回联邦调查局
We're pulling up to FBI.

418
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:20,044
我们得让你先待在这个隔离箱里
We have to put you in an isolation suit

419
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,061
然后才能把你送到隔离区里
To transfer you to the quarantine area.

420
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:24,028
我知道
I understand.

421
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,096
感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

422
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,043
没什么不同
No different.

423
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,042
鲍尔先生的血液检查结果出来了
We have the results of Mr. Bauer's blood work.

424
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:34,017
谢谢
Thank you.

425
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:43,061
开门
Open it.

426
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:02,036
谢谢
Thank you.

427
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,003
打扰一下
Excuse me.

428
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:24,026
拉里让我告诉你
Larry wanted me to tell you,

429
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:25,089
疾病控制中心的人带杰克·鲍尔来了
That CDC arrived with Jack Bauer.

430
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,087
我会在楼下隔离区见他们
I'll meet them down in quarantine.

431
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:28,043
他不在隔离区
he's not in quarantine.

432
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:30,037
我不明白
I don't understand.

433
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:31,070
我知道的就这么多
That's all i know.

434
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:33,071
他们刚通过安检  他正上楼
They just cleared security. he's on his way up.

435
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:45,015
杰克  你好吗
Jack,are you okay?

436
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:47,015
我的血液检查结果是阳性
My blood work came back positive.

437
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:48,048
我被感染了
I'm infected.

438
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:50,075
鲍尔先生  你可以在那间屋里换衣服
Mr. Bauer,there's a room for you to change in.

439
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:53,013
谢谢
Thank you.

440
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:55,073
没事
It's fine.

441
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,003
他并没待在隔离区里
But he's not in quarantine.

442
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,020
我们了解到这种病并不传染
We've learned the disease isn't contagious.

443
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:04,010
病毒被这么设计的原因是防止
It was engineered that way to prevent blowback

444
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:05,060
传播病毒的人受到感染
On the people deploying it.

445
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:08,057
但你们一定可以想到办法来救他
Okay. But there has to be something that you can do to help him.

446
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:10,024
无药可医
There's no cure.

447
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,037
但他是第一个感染者
But he's patient zero.

448
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:12,061
我们需要做进一步的实验
Whatever we learn from the pathogen

449
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:15,012
来了解病原体的信息
Will come from the tests we still need to run.

450
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:19,055
失陪一下
Excuse me.

451
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,095
我是梅瑟尔
This is Macer.

452
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:24,060
他现在情况稳定
He's stable for the moment.

453
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:30,033
请进
Yeah.

454
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:35,073
杰克
Jack,um...

455
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:38,020
我不知道说什么才好
I don't know what to say.

456
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:41,015
那就告诉我莫斯在斯塔克伍德上的进展吧
Then tell me that agent Moss followed up on Starkwood.

457
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:46,064
抱歉
Sorry.

458
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:49,024
拉里向白宫汇报了情况
Larry debriefed the White House

459
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:51,075
我们正等总统决定行动方针
And we're waiting on the president to decide on a course of action.

460
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,022
很好
Good.

461
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:54,032
有托尼的消息没
Any word on Tony?

462
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:58,003
抱歉  目前还没任何消息
Sorry,we don't know anything yet.

463
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,072
我要询问你有关
I need to debrief you

464
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,076
你所看见的毒气罐的情况
On the canisters that you saw.

465
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:05,076
你没事吧
You okay with that?

466
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,084
没事
Yeah.

467
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:15,017
我看到了港务局警察的口供
I read the statement from the port authority cop.

468
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,031
他说你为了救他
He said that you risked the mission

469
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:19,072
差点让整个行动功亏一篑
To save his life.

470
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,002
你做得对
You did the right thing.

471
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:27,029
谢谢
Thanks.

472
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,022
是实验室打来的
Uh,it's the lab.

473
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,013
也许是霍奇斯
It's probably Hodges.

474
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,063
我们得接电话
We should talk to him.

475
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:18,004
打开免提
Put it on speaker.

476

我是西顿

477
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:23,054
你究竟到哪里去了
Where the hell have you been?

478
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,057
我一直在找你
I've been trying to reach you.

479
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:27,091
我在看阿尔梅达这里的情况
I was,uh,checking on Almeida.

480
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,051
斯多克斯让他开口了吗
Did stokes get him to talk?

481
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:31,075
他还在进行  先生
He's still working on that,sir.

482
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:33,075
我告诉他  如果阿尔梅达不开口
I told him to put Almeida down

483
00:25:33,076 --> 00:25:35,005
就把他干掉
If he didn't start talking.

484
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:37,059
我觉得应该多给他些时间  先生
I think we should give him a few more minutes,sir.

485
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,034
我们正忙着在政府行动之前
We're busting our asses to get these weapons ready

486
00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:41,076
部署好这些武器
Before the government makes their move,

487
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:44,073
大家都要时刻准备
I want all hands on deck.

488
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:46,009
我马上就来 先生
We'll be there soon,sir.

打电话给调查局

我要设一个保密线路

确保没人可以窃听

493
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:57,078
好的  快点干吧
All right,well,do it.

494
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,048
从没想到乔纳斯会走到这个地步
I never thought Jonas would take it this far.

495
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:03,064
他是一个爱国者
I mean,the man's a patriot.

496
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:07,028
他成立斯塔克伍德是为了保护这个国家
He founded Starkwood to protect this country.

497
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:09,095
那他怎么还会发动这场袭击呢
Yeah,well,why is he attacking it?

498
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:11,062
原因很复杂的
It's complicated.

499
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:14,046
我也不了解
I don't understand it myself.

500
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:16,086
我应该尽自己的全力阻止这次袭击的
I should've done more to stop this.

501
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:20,083
我本应几个月前就报告调查局的
I should've called FBI months ago.

502
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:23,030
你现在这么做是对的
Well,you're doing the right thing now.

503
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:25,080
我把所有关于斯塔克伍德的信息全调出来了

How's he doing?

518
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:58,027
很难说
Hard to tell.

519
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,077
拉里  今天太多的人为此付出了生命
Larry,so many people have died today.

520
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,084
我们不能让他们白白牺牲啊
We cannot let their deaths be for nothing

521
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:04,081
不会的

他知道武器的藏匿地点

00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:27,066
该录像带是45分钟前从一残存的
It was smuggled out of the remains

552
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:30,049
生化武器实验室偷带出来的
Of a biological weapons lab about 45 minutes ago.

553
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,016
现在可以确认了
It's a confirmation that Juma was experimenting

554
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:38,093
朱玛在自己人身上试验生化武器
With biological weapons on the local population.

555
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:42,024
这些可怜的人遭受着
These poor people were suffering

556
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:45,034
军用级朊病毒变体的毒害
From the effects of the weaponized prion variant.

557
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:48,051
这就是我们让斯塔克伍德
And that's what we allowed Starkwood

558
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:50,054
带到这个国家的东西
To bring into this country.

559
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:52,058
这可不能算我们的错
We didn't allow this.

560
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,042
斯塔克伍德是我们亲手造就的魔鬼
Starkwood is a monster we created,Olivia.

561
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:57,092
这几年来我们一直优待他
We have been feeding it for years.

562
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:59,085
给他们军队合约
We gave them military contracts.

563
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:01,086
我们信赖他们的雇佣兵
We relied on their paid mercenaries

564
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:03,036
胜过自己的军队
Instead of our own soldiers,

565
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:05,096
外包给他们情报收集任务
Outsourced intelligence gathering operations.

566
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:07,079
上帝啊  我们甚至出台了一部法律
My god,we even passed a law

567
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,046
让他们可以在首都华盛顿
So that they could build a military base

568
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,043
仅仅13公里远的地方建造军事基地
13 miles from the nation's capitol.

569
00:29:11,044 --> 00:29:13,043
您上任以来一直是对他们持反对态度的
You fought against all that.

570
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:16,037
你一直想限制斯塔克伍德的势力膨胀
You've been trying to limit Starkwood's power Ever since you took office.

571
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:19,044
我做的还不够
I didn't do enough...

572
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:21,048
还不及时
Fast enough.

573
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:24,075
现在可能太晚了
And now it may be too late.

574
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:26,078
总统阁下  蒂姆·伍兹
Madam president,tim woods

575
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,045
和斯密斯上校要见您
And admiral smith are here to see you.

576
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,046
-让他们进来吧  -是  阁下
- Send them in.  - Yes,ma'am.

577
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,049
总统阁下  调查局的拉里·莫斯在线
Madam president,Larry Moss at FBI is calling in.

578
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,052
他说事态紧急
He says it's urgent.

579
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:37,099
接过来
Put him through.

580
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,006
莫斯探员  总统就在这  请讲
Agent Moss,the president's here. go ahead.

581
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:42,017
总统阁下  一个在斯塔克伍德的人
Madam president,we've been contacted

582
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,056
刚刚联系了我们
By someone inside Starkwood.

583
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:45,057
是托尼·阿尔梅达
Ma'am,it's Tony Almeida.

584
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:47,023
阿尔梅达
Almeida?

585
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:49,034
他一直在协助鲍尔夺回那些武器
He's been working with Jack Bauer to recover these weapons.

586
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:51,037
他被俘之后
He was taken captive but then released

587
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:52,097
又被一个内部人员放了
By someone on the inside.

588
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:55,025
他叫格雷格·西顿
His name is Greg seaton.

589
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,098
他是乔纳斯·霍奇手下的核心成员
He's part of Jonas Hodges' inner circle.

590
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:58,065
他想告诉我们武器的位置
Ma'am,he says he's willing to tell us

591
00:29:58,066 --> 00:30:01,001
来交换豁免权
Where the weapons are in exchange for immunity.

592
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:04,058
我已开始为定点突袭作部署
Now,I've already started mobilizing for a targeted raid.

593
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:05,092
我们可以打他们个措手不及
We can catch 'em by surprise

594
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:07,033
夺回这些武器
And lock down these weapons.

595
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:09,059
但需要您签署一份对西顿的豁免协议
But i'm going to need you to sign an immunity agreement for this man.

596
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,016
西顿的这个情报  你觉得可靠吗
How confident are you of seaton's intel?

597
00:30:12,017 --> 00:30:14,010
千真万确  阁下
We believe it's genuine,ma'am.

598
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:15,063
总统阁下
Madam president,

599
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,016
机不可失  时不再来啊
We may not get a chance like this again.

600
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:19,007
史密斯上将你觉得呢
Admiral smith?

601
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:20,040
我也这么认为
I concur

602
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,057
我还建议给局里一支海豹突击队作为后援
But I would suggest we supplement the FBI With a seal squad.

603
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:25,000
只要我一声令下  即刻出发
They're ready to move on my order.

604
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:26,074
司法部长看到我们在行动中出动部队
The attorney general will raise hell

605
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,058
肯定会不依不饶
About us involving the military in this operation.

606
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,058
待会再说他吧
We'll deal with him later.

607
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,008
莫斯探员
Agent Moss,you have

608
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:35,008
我直接授权你进攻斯塔克伍德
My direct authorization to move on Starkwood.

609
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:37,008
什么时候能准备好
How soon can you be ready?

610
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,092
我们已经通过网讯公司
We've already drafted an executive pardon,

611
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:40,074
上传了刚刚起草的一份豁免书
And set it up via webex.

612
00:30:40,075 --> 00:30:43,069
等您的电子签名一到  我们就可以出发了
You'll be able to give a secure digital signature and we are good to go.

613
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,053
文件在您助理的电脑上
We have the document set up at your assistant's computer.

614
00:30:56,072 --> 00:30:58,054
莫斯探员  总统准备签了
Agent Moss, the president is prepared to sign.

615
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:00,028
请签字吧  阁下

616
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:07,048

617
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,088
托尼  看到签名了吗
Tony,did you get the signature?

618
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:09,092
嗯  看到了
Yeah,we're good.

619
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:12,002
什么时候能到达斯塔克伍德
When can you be at Starkwood?

620
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,085
10分钟之内
We can be there in ten minutes.

621
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:16,000
莫斯探员  谢谢

出发
Let's go.

625
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:22,060
总统阁下  我们这次真幸运啊
Madam president,we may have just caught a lucky break.

626
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:24,026
危机解除之前
Until this plays out,

627
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:27,054
大家还得继续寻求其他良策
I want everyone to keep looking for other options.

628
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:37,041
好的  西顿先生
All right,Mr. seaton.

629
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:39,041
请说吧
Go ahead.

630
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:41,045
武器在一个仓库里
The weapons are in a warehouse

631
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:44,012
就在基地的东北角
On the northeast quadrant of the compound.

632
00:31:44,013 --> 00:31:47,029
北纬32度44分23秒
32,44.23 north...

633
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,057
西经117度10分42秒
117,10.42 west.

634
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,026
西顿先生  我们需要有人在地面协助侦查
Mr. seaton,it would help to have someone on the ground doing recon.

635
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,096
你可以把托尼带到仓库那边吗
Can you get Tony to that warehouse?

636
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,010
可以的
I think so.

637
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,095
最好找一个步话机来
See if you can get ahold of a hand radio.

638
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:01,032
我们在480千赫频段
We'll be on 480 kilohertz.

639
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:02,037
好的  我们马上就到
All right,we'll be there.

640
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:05,014
如果我们在这降落  离仓库只有50码
If we land here,we'll be within 50 yards of the warehouse.

641
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:07,087
后援小组在这和这  给我们作策应
Yeah,support teams here and here. Shore us up.

642

和海军协同作战
Coordinate with the navy.

643
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:11,022

644
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:13,024
出发
Let's move!

645
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,046
你们在调兵遣将  发生什么事了
You're mobilizing. what's going on?

646
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:18,075
我们接到托尼的电话
We got a call from Tony.

647
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:20,082
他和斯塔克伍德的一个内应一起行动
He's working with an informant inside Starkwood.

648
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,022
我们知道武器的位置了
We got a location on the weapon,

649
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,016
-我们正准备派部队进行突袭  -我想去
- We're getting ready to stage a raid on the compound.  - I want to go.

650
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:27,063
我能理解你的动机  但很抱歉
I can understand why,but i'm sorry.

651
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:29,016
-我不会批准  -拉里  我能帮上忙
- I can't allow it. - Larry,i can help you with this.

652
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:30,080
我是唯一见过毒气罐的人
I'm the only one who's seen the canisters,

653
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,043
我知道它什么样
I know exactly what we're looking for.

654
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:35,057
我看了你的简报  你把所需细节都说了
I read your debrief. You gave us all the details we need.

655
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:38,035
拉里  拜托了  我有权去
Larry,please,i've earned this.

656
00:32:39,098 --> 00:32:43,064
杰克  我清楚你今天所立下的汗马功劳
Jack,i know what you've done today,

657
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:45,091
还有你所付出的巨大牺牲
The sacrifice you've made.

658
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:47,041
在其他任何情况下
Uh,under any other circumstances,

659
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:50,040
我会让你和大家并肩作战  但你被感染了
I'd want you out there with us,but you're sick,

660
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,092
我们不知道  你什么时候会发作
And we have no idea when you're going to start showing sympToms.

661
00:32:52,093 --> 00:32:55,089
我不能在行动中冒这个险
I cannot risk that happening out in the field.

662
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,027
这次行动需要精兵强将
I need my best men for this operation.

663
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:02,037
我希望你能理解
I hope you can understand that.

664
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:08,028
你是对的
You're right.

665
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:12,015
你是对的
You're right.

666
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,069
我一直坚信最终我们会有达成一致的地方
I always knew eventually we'd agree on something.

667
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,013
我很抱歉  杰克
I'm so sorry,Jack.

668
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,047
西顿先生吗
Mr. Seaton?

669
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:07,028
墨菲  我需要查一下人员
Murphy,i need To check the personnel that...

670
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:38,094
就在那
That's it.

671
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,041
武器都在里面
The weapons are inside there.

672
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,051
里面有多少人
How many men inside?

674
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:50,012
怎么也得12个以上吧
I'm guessing a dozen or more.

675
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:55,082
形势逼人啊  汤米
Wolves are at the door,Tommy.

676
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:57,083
还要多久
How much longer?

677
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,093
武器部署完还需一小时  先生
We're still an hour away from being armed,sir.

678
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:02,033
我们刚截获了政府的通讯
We just intercepted a government transmission.

679
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,063
联邦调查局的人正杀将过来
FBI is on the way.

680
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:08,004
先生  我们连序列检查都没完成呢
Sir,we haven't even run the sequence checks yet.

681
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:09,077
快马加鞭吧
Let's do it!

682
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:12,061
该死
Oh,damn it.

683
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,015
还要多久能到
What's our ETA?

684
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:21,065
2分钟  长官
Two minutes,sir.

685
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:23,058

你什么意思

阿尔梅达威胁说要杀我

741

我只好编他想听的告诉他

742
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:19,092
你这狗娘养的骗子   是你主动来找我的

743
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:22,032

746
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,070
托尼  托尼  你退下

看到了吧

西顿老弟给我们争取到了一点时间

他们在基地的另一边

我们只要把他们困在那就成了

蕾妮  我们扑空了

Tony's informant sent us to the wrong location.

759
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:42,027
整件事就是个骗局
This whole thing was a diversion.

760
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:44,037
他们不可能转移那么快
They couldn't have gotten them out that fast.

761
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:45,091
武器还藏在基地的某个地方
The weapons are there somewhere.

762
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:48,068
拉里  武器一定还在斯塔克伍德基地中

呆在原地
Stay in position.

775
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:49,014
让拉里叫他的人放下武器
Tell Larry to have his men stand down.

776
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:51,064
你开玩笑吧  他们想跟联邦军队动武
Are you kidding me? they just drew on federal forces.

777
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:52,069
如果你不想你的人白白送死的话
If you don't want to lose your men,you'll get them

778
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:54,047
就叫他们立刻缴械投降  快
To stand down now. now!

779
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,082
别开枪
Hold your fire!

780
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:06,002
够了  别再往前了
That's far enough.

781
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:15,013
我们已配合了你们搜查这仓库的要求
We cooperated with your demand to search this building.

782
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:16,030
现在  我们要求你们离开
Now,we're asking you to leave.

783
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,063
这里有生化武器
There are biological weapons on this facility.

784
00:42:18,063 --> 00:42:20,030
找不到它们  我们不会走
We're not going anywhere without them.

785
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,014
让你的人退后
Now,tell your men to stand down.

786
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:23,067
这种诬陷太荒谬了
Those charges are absurd,

787
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:26,017
我们不会让你们继续搜索的
And we're not going to let you keep searching.

788
00:42:26,017 --> 00:42:27,081
这里是私人领地
You're on private property,

789
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:30,048
如有必要  我们会奋起反击
And we're prepared to defend it if necessary.

790
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,065
你在威胁联邦探员
You are threatening federal agents.

791
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:34,065
马上给我退后
Stand down! now!

792
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:35,092
我们在维护自己的权利
We're protecting our rights

793
00:42:35,092 --> 00:42:37,049
我们不会让一个充满敌意的政府
Against a hostile government that's using

794
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:40,022
用莫须有的罪名来关闭我们的基地
False charges to try to shut us down.

795
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:42,046
我们不想兵刃相见
Now,we don't want any bloodshed.

796
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:48,000
但如果你们得寸进尺
But if you try to advance any farther,

797
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,087
我们会开枪还击
