你个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

你杀了我儿子
You're behind my son's death.

00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:21,012
总统阁下

下令让你的军队 从我的国家

12
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:27,006
桑加拉的边境永久撤军
Sangala,immediately and permanently.

13
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,003
否则你丈夫会被
Or your husband will die a slow

14
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:32,003
我只想确认一下
I just wanted to make sure

15
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,004
你今晚会不会回来吃饭
That youere still coming to dinner tonight.

16
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,004
抱歉  玛丽卡  我会补偿的
Marika,i can't. I'll make it up to you.

17
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,037
你要找玛丽卡的话  她不在我这
If you're looking for marika, she's not with me.

18
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,007
我找的是你  塞缪尔
I'm looking for you,samuel.

19
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,051
或许这不是你的真名
Or whatever your real name is.

20
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:44,098
我不想知道你的身份  也不在乎
Now,i don't know who you really are,and I don't care.

21
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:47,075
我只想让你远离我妹妹
I just want you out of my sister's life.

22
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:58,003
对一件事守口如瓶
Keep an incident quiet

23
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:00,003
直到我和杰克搞定一切
Until what jack and I are doing goes done.

24
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,086
沃斯勒死了
Vossler's dead.

25
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:04,077
杰克在里根街18号的酒店杀了他
Jack killed him at the hotel

26
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,037
他是正当防卫

27
00:01:06,037 --> 00:01:08,084
该死  蕾妮  你和他到底在干吗
Damn it,renee,what the hell are you doing with this guy?

28
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:11,041
我们应该抓捕疑犯  不是处决他们
You're supposed to bring suspects in, not murder them.

29
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,004
在我们查出杜巴库的内线之前
Until we know who dubaku's source is there,

30
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,094
你不能把这事告诉局里的人
You've got to hale this outside the bureau.

31
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:17,028
杜巴库是唯一知道在政府里面
Dubaku is the only person with the names of the people

32
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:18,055
都有谁背叛了您的人
Who betrayed you within your government

33
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:20,018
我们必须找到他
It's imperative that we find him.

34
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:22,015
你已经辞去了公职
You resigned from government service

35
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,005
参议院也把你定性为叛国者
and the senate regards you as having been a renegade agent.

36
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:29,022
这叫我如何相信你呢
How am I supposed to know where your loyalties really lie?

37
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,029
恕我直言  总统阁下
With all due respect, madame president,

38
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:33,056
您可以打听我的为人

39
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:36,036
我查到了亨利·泰勒的地址
I got an address for henry taylor.

40
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:44,034
快叫救护车
Get an ambulance!

41
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:53,034
以下事件发生于下午4点到5点

00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:03,076
任何人都不许入内
No one else gets through here.

46
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,001

泰勒先生  请不要讲话
Mr. taylor,don't speak.

48
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,021
我需要您保存体力

49
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:29,035
在这

抱歉  请后退
Excuse me. step back,please.

51
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:33,045
这是第6单元
This is unit six.

52
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:35,009
我这有一名胸部中枪的伤者

53
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,012

胸骨下方9毫米伤口

55
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,079
-脉搏跳动加速  -你没事吧

56
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,070
-没事  -我要打电话给总统

我要你搜索全部房间

58
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:43,063

Anything off their hardware

59
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,083
杜巴库去向的线索
That's going to tell us where dubaku went.

60
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:53,024
我是杰克·鲍尔

61
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,068

63
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:58,018
总统阁下

00:02:58,018 --> 00:02:59,088
请您不要灰心丧气

65
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:02,045
杜巴库知道我们骗了他  伊桑

66
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,035
他没有理由让亨利活着
He has no reason to keep henry alive.

67
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:06,079
总统阁下  杰克·鲍尔在1号线
Jack bauer is on line one, madame president.

68
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:08,099
接进来
Put him through.

69
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,033
鲍尔先生  我是泰勒总统
Mr. bauer this is president taylor.

70
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,016
总统阁下  我们救出了您丈夫
Madame president,we have your husband.

71
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:14,040
他还活着
He is alive, but he sustained

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,027
但是他胸部中枪
A gunshot wound to the chest.

73
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:18,073
情况有多坏
How bad is it?

74
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,090
紧急营救小组已经稳定了情况
Emts are stabilizing him.

75
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,094
他们正准备把他送往

76
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:22,050
西阿林顿医院急救
To west arlington spital.

77
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,054
鲍尔先生  说具体点
Mr. bauer, be more specific.

78
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:26,098
我丈夫会没事吗
Is my husband going to be okay?

79
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:29,018
这要等见了医生才知道
We're not gonna know anything until the doctors see him.

80
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:31,065
阁下  我不得不告诉您  他失血严重
Ma'am,i have to warn you, he has lost a lot of blood.

81
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,072
杰克  我是比尔  你们抓到杜巴库了吗
Jack,it's bill. do you have baku?

82
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:35,052
没有  他在我们到之前就离开了
Negative-- he was gone before we got here.

83
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,065
总统阁下
Madame president,

84
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:37,079
既然您丈夫是杜巴库
Since your husband was the only leverage

85
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,035
留在这里的唯一筹码  那么
That dubaku had left, it's safe to say

86
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,092
他现在应该准备离开这个国家了
That he is trying to leave the country now.

87
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:43,086
你认为他下一步准备做什么呢
Have you any idea how he intends to do that?

88
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:44,099
我也不清楚  不幸的是
Not at this time. unfortunately,

89
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,056
他的人在这次行动中都死了
All his men were killed during the assault.

90
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:48,010
沃克探员和我将继续追踪
Agent walker and I will stay behind.

91
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,073
我们将搜索整个地区
We'll continue to search the area.

92
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:51,073
我们不得不假设杜巴库已经计划好了
We have to assume that dubaku has an exit strategy

93
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,083
撤退的方案
Already in place.

94
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,010
无论如何我们都要抓到他
Whatever we're going to do to find him,

95
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,090
而且必须要快
We're going to ha to do it fast.

96
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,091
是的
Yes.

97
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:59,007
谢谢你  鲍尔先生
Thank you,mr. bauer.

98
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,084
请随时通知我事情的进展
Please keep me apprised on everything.

99
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,028
好的  阁下
Yes,ma'am.

100
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:06,045
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:11,018
我很难过  总统阁下
I am so sorry,madame president.

102
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,012
伊桑  我要去医院
Ethan, I'm going to the hospital

103
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,036
陪我的丈夫
To be with my husband.

104
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,003
阁下  这恐怕不行
Ma'am,that's not possible.

105
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:20,013
您正在指挥一场军事行动
You're exeting a military invasion.

106
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:22,096
没有我在  将军们也能胜任这次行动
My generals can execute it perfectly well without me.

107
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,093
我们不能忽视
We can't ignore the fact

108
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:27,060
特勤局有内鬼的事实
The secret service has been compromised

109
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,074
我们无法保证您在
There's no way we can ensure your safety outside

110
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:31,017
-白宫外的安全  -我不在乎
the white house. I don't give a damn.

111
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:33,014
我不想在我丈夫生命垂危的时刻
I am not going to be held prisoner in this office

112
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:35,008
还把自己关在这间办公室里
while my husband is fighting for his life.

113
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,078
现在  要么找人
Now,either find some one

114
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:39,055
送我去医院  要么我自己开车去
To take me to the hospital or I'll drive there myself.

115
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:42,082
总统阁下  您了解我的工作履历
Madame president, you know my record of service.

116
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,079
如果您同意的话
If it's acceptable to you, I'm willing

117
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,029
我愿意担当您的保护工作
To assume responsibility for your security.

118
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,029
比尔  你已经不在职了
Bill,you're no longer credentialed.

119
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,076
你没有这个权限
You don't have the authority.

120
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:51,073
除非我们抓到杜巴库并审讯他
Until we capture dubaku and interrogate him,

121
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:53,076
不然我们根本不知道政府中还有谁
We have no idea who in the government is working

122
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,080
为他工作
For him.

123
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,073
您不知道可以信任谁
You do not know who you can trust.

124
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:58,057
但我可以信任你
But I can trust you.

125
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,043
是我告知了您这次危机
I brought this conspiracy to your attention,

126
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,000
总统阁下
Madame president.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,014
我希望您能让我把它解决
I would hope that I could end it.

128
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,091
你需要我做什么
What do you need from me?

129
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:08,078
恢复我的职位和权限
Reinstate my government clearance,

130
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:11,045
允许我清查白宫全体官员
Allow me the authority to vet white house staff,

131
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,028
并让我的人进入联邦调查局
And allow to bring one of my people into fbi

132
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:16,079
给拉里·莫斯提供战术支持
To provide lary moss with tactical support.

133
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,029
你想带谁进入
Who is it that you want to bring in?

134
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,049
克罗伊·奥布赖恩
chole o'brian.

135
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,012
我可以保证  她是最佳人选
I can vouch for her; shs the best there is.

136
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:24,079
她的权限在反恐小组被解散时被收回了
Her clearances were also revoked when ctu was decommissioned.

137
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,026
除了她以外我们就没有
Isn't there anyone capable of handling these duties

138
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,043
别的人能胜任这项工作了吗
Without our having to reinstate her?

139
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:32,033
调查局里有人为杜巴库工作
Someone in the bureau is on dubaku's payroll.

140
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,043
除非我们找出这个人
Until we find out who it is,

141
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,067
否则拉里·莫斯是不会
Larry moss can't take the chance

142
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,070
冒险把他的人

143
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,027
送去调查的
Into a manhunt for dubaku.

144
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:40,007
好吧
All right.

145
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,081
白宫特勤局的负责人是
The director of white house secret service operations

146
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,095
霍维斯探员

147
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:46,051

148
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:48,012
我了解霍维斯  总统阁下
I know ted hovis, madame president.

149
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:49,065
他可不喜欢这样  他会给我们找麻烦
He's not gonna like this; he's gonna fight us.

150
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,049
考虑到他的手下要对

151

我丈夫的事负全责

152
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,049
我才不在乎他乐意与否
I don't give a damn what he likes.

153
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:57,053
布坎南先生  你要求你临危受命

158
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,070
总统阁下

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,027
我清楚你的想法  伊桑
Your concerns are clear to me,ethan,

160
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:08,030
但我意已决

我只想干好我的工作

保护好您的利益

163
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:16,004
我当前的利益就是抓住杜巴库
My interest right now is catching ike dubaku.

164
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,048
他今天已经杀了无数的美国人
He has killed scores of americans today,

165
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:21,088
还想杀我的丈夫  而且还买通了我的人
He tried to kill my husband,and he has corrupted our government.

166
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:26,009
无论如何  我都要抓住这个狗东西
Whatever it takes, i want that son of a bitch found.

167
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:34,013
玛丽卡  玛丽卡
Marika... marika.

168
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:36,060
塞缪尔  你在这干吗
Samuel,what are you doing here?

169
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,010
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

170
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,074
好吧  我20分钟后休息
Uh, okay, well, I get a break in 20 minutes.

171
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,060
不行  就现在
No,now.

172
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,094
过来
come

173
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:45,094
好吧  出什么事了
Okay,what is it?

174
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:46,094
你吓着我了
You're scaring me.

175
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:48,068
出事了
Some thing has come up.

176
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:49,091
我必须离开这个国家
I need to leave the country.

177
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,058
什么
What?

178
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:52,058
什么时候
When?

179
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,081
马上
Right away.

180
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,002
我不明白
I don't understand.

181
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:56,005
你什么时候回来
When are you coming back?

182
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:57,072
玛丽卡  听我说
Marika, listen to me.

183
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:59,069
我对你说谎了
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

184
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:01,066
我的护照在几个月以前就过期了
My passport visa expired a couple months ago

185
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:03,036
我一直是非法居住在这里
And I've been in the country illegally.

186
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:07,033
恐怕移民局的人正在抓我
I'm afraid the immigration people have caught up with me.

187
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:09,006
是我姐姐干的  对吧
It was my sister,wasn't it?

188
00:07:09,006 --> 00:07:10,060
她举报了你  是不是
She reported you,didn't she?

189
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,000
这已经不重要了
That doesn't matter now.

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,037
重要的是我必须在今晚离开这个国家
What is important is I have to leave the country tonight,

191
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:15,067
我想让你跟我一起走
And i want you to come with me.

192
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,077
今晚
Tonight?

193
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:19,011
玛丽卡  我们谈过这事
Marika,we've talked about this.

194
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:21,008
我向你承诺过有一天我会带你离开这
I promised you that one day I would take you away from here,

195
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,038
给与你应得的幸福
Give you the happiness that you deserve.

196
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,001
塞缪尔  我  我也想这样
Samuel, i-i want that,too,

197
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,031
但是今晚  有点太快了
But... but not tonight, not so soon.

198
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,058
玛丽卡  我已经没有时间和你争论了
Marika, i don't have time to argue with you!

199
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:33,059
对不起
I'm sorry.

200
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,022
我不能离开罗莎
I can't leave rosa.

201
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,013
她需要我  我是唯一能照顾她的人
She needs me; I'm the only one she has to take care of her.

202
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:39,056
你知道的
You know that.

203
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,066
我知道  我知道
I know,i know.

204
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:43,043
这就是她也要走的原因
Which is why she's going to join us.

205
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:44,043
和我们一起
Join us?

206
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,087
越快越好
As soon as possible.

207
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:48,007
今晚我只能弄到我们两人的票
I could only arrange tickets for both of us tonight,

208
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:50,034
但是我要你保证不告诉她
But I want you to promise not to tell your sister

209
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,034
我们的计划  至少现在不行
Of our plans, at least not yet.

210
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:54,031
我必须告诉她  我不能就这样一走了之
I have to; I can't just run off.

211
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:56,074
不  不行  她会给我们找麻烦
No,no,no,she might cause trouble for us,

212
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:59,025
我们就走不了了
Make it impossible for us to leave.

213
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:03,042
我保证你姐姐会在我们到后几天
I promise you your sister will join us

214
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,075
跟我们会合
Within a couple of days of our arrival.

215
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:08,016
-好吗  -我们去哪
Okay? our arrival where?

216
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:09,032
伯利兹城
Belize.

217
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,082
我给你看过我家在那的照片
I have shown you the photographs of my home there.

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,050
你爱我么
Do you love me?

219
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,020
你知道答案的
You know I do.

220
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,080
那就相信我
Then trust me.

221
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,070
说你会来
Say you'll come.

222
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:29,081
我去收拾行李
I'll get my things.

223
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:35,092
我还需要安排一下我们的行程
I still need to finalize our arrangements.

224
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:37,055
你回家去收拾东西吧
I want you to go home and pack.

225
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:38,055
等我电话
Wait for my call.

226
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:41,089
好的
All right.

227
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:53,023
-请讲  -是我
-Yes -It's me.

228
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,074
你都安排妥当了么
Have you made the preparations?

229
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,033
差不多了
Almost.

230
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,051
安排一条航道挺麻烦的
It's been tricky clearing a flight corridor

231
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:58,081
因为航管局还在禁飞
Since FAA still has most private

232
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,041
多数的私人和商务飞机
And commercial aircraft grounded

233
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,054
我相信你能搞定
I have faith you'll manage.

234
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:04,038
安排的是两个乘客吗
The arrangements are for two passengers?

235
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:05,071
按你的要求
Just as you requested.

236
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,095
你确定现在要走么  上校
Are you sure you want to leave now,colonel?

237
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:09,088
朱玛将军要是知道你放弃了任务
I can't imagine general Juma will be pleased

238
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,069
是绝对不会高兴的吧
To learn that you're abandoning your mission.

239
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:12,075
这次任务失败了
The mission is over.

240
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:14,019
该做的我都做了
I have done what I can do.

241
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,059
要是朱玛还不满意
If that is not enough for Juma,

242
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,019
那就让他见鬼去吧
Then to hell with him.

243
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,016
我已经拿到了你的护照和路线
I've got your passports and itinerary in hand.

244
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:22,033
半小时后老地方见
Meet me at our usual spot in half an hour.

245
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,050
我给你带去

248
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,074
这可不是什么好主意
That's not a good idea.

249
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:31,017
在这个时间  那人太多了
It'll be crowded there at this hour.

250
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:32,027
我知道
I know.

251
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:34,084
我要早点见你
I want the meeting earlier.

252
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:37,071
15分钟后见
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

253
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:43,038
开车
Go.

254
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:45,075
启动不了了
I can't get it to boot.

255
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:46,079
硬盘肯定被烧毁了
Hard drive must be fried.

256
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,079
该死
Damn it.

257
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,086
咱们搜下尸体
Let's search the bodies.

258
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:52,056
从他开始
Start with him.

259
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,017
喂
Yeah.

260
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:00,044
蕾妮  是我
Renee,it's me.

261
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:02,040
比尔·布坎南刚跟我通报了你们的情况
Bill buchanan just briefed me on your situation.

262
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,090
亨利·泰勒的情况如何
What's Henry Taylor's status?

263
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,091
他们把他送往
They've got him in an ambulance

264
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:06,051
西阿林顿医院了
En route to West Arlington Hospital.

265
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:07,088
我也不清楚他目前的情况
I don't know his current condition.

266
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:10,041
布坎南告诉我  你和鲍尔跟他们交火了
Buchanan told me you and Bauer were in a firefight.

267
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,028

Yeah,we took down six of dubaku's men,

268
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,055
不过  杜巴库在我们来之前就离开了
But dubaku was gone before we got there.

269
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:15,075
你没事吧
You all right?

270
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:17,092
大风大浪都经历了
I've been in worse.

271
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:19,028
你确定吗
Are you sure?

272
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:23,009
小意思  我没事  拉里
I'm fine, Larry.

273
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:24,009
真的吗
Really?

274
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,093
我可不这么认为
I'm not so sure about that.

275
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:28,010
你什么意思
And what is that supposed to mean?

276
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,077
警方发给我一个报告
I'm looking at a report faxed to me from metro police.

277
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:33,077
一位叫卡罗尔·沃斯勒的太太声称
A mrs. carol vossler

She says the woman threatened to kill her son.

281
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:41,098
拉里  你知道的
Larry,we discussed this.

282
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,078
我们得逼沃斯勒告诉我们
We needed to get vossler to tell us

283
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:44,081
泰勒被关押在哪
Where taylor was being held.

284
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:46,045
那是我们唯一的筹码
It was the only leverage we had.

285
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,035
对  没错  为达目的不择手段
Yeah, right, whatever's necessary.

286
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,075
杰克·鲍尔为他的野蛮行径
Jack Bauer's rationalization

287
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:51,045
做的合理化辩解
For every unethical action he takes.

288
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:52,052
我们达到目的了  拉里
It worked, larry.

289
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,069
难道不值这么做吗
Doesn't that count for something?

290
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,042
蕾妮  杰克·鲍尔就快被
Renee, Jack Bauer is about to be strung up

291
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,049
参议院处决了
By a senate subcommittee,

292
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:58,036
你正在步他的后尘
And you are following his playbook.

293
00:10:58,036 --> 00:10:59,039
司法部办公室已经在调查
You already got the ag's office

294
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,060
你摘下坦纳呼吸器的事情
Looking into that thing you pulled

295
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,063
现在是一波未平一波又起
With tanner's respirator, and now this.

296
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:05,050
-又没有人受伤  -没人受伤
No one was actually hurt. no one...?

297
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,064
蕾妮  鲍尔杀了那女人的丈夫
Renee, Bauer killed the woman's husband!

298
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:11,004
蕾妮  我发誓
Renee, I swear to you,

299
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,064
你为你的处境很担忧
I am scared of what is happening to you.

300
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:15,044
你让这些人生不如死
You put these people through hell

301
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,021
你却对此心安理得
And it doesn't bother you.

302
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:19,058
我没有心安理得  拉里
I don't say that it doesn't bother me,larry.

303
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:20,098
我是说我们达到目的了
I said that it worked.

304
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:24,035
我当然也很难过
Of course it bothers me.

305
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:28,079
那女人的脸还在我眼前晃动
I can see that woman's face.

306
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,006
她和孩子用那种眼神看着我
She and her child staring at me with such...

307
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,033
她完全不知道自己的丈夫是个杀手
She had no idea that her husband was a killer,

308
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,060
是个叛国者
A traitor to his country,

309
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,027
我在她眼里就像一个恶魔
And she looked at me like i was the monster.

310
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,043
沃克探员
Agent walker.

311
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:40,070
等下
Hold on.

312
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,034
我对照了这些
I cross-referenced the information

313
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,047
掌上电脑的信息
On these PDAs.

314

发现一些银行交易记录
I came across some banking transactions.

315
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:46,041
所有相关的账户
All from a series of accounts

316
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,094
都是用一个地址注册的
Registered to the same address.

317
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:49,004
你觉得那是个安全屋吗
You think it's a safe house?

318
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:50,018
值得一查
It's worth a shot.

319
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:52,025
拉里  我们可能找到一个跟杜巴库有关的地址
Larry,we may have an address on dubaku.

320
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:55,075
欧几里德大街21917号

欧几里德大街21917号  6号公寓
21917 Euclid Street,Unit Six.

323
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,072
我们马上出发
We're moving out now.

324
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:01,049
你能提供卫星监控么
Can you provide sat surveillance?

325
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:03,016
好的  比尔·布坎南派人来做技术支持了
Yeah,bill buchanan's sending somebody over

326
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:05,016
但是在她来到并设置好之前
To run tech,but until she's up and running,

327
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,093
你们只能摸着石头过河了
You're gonna have to go in blind.

328
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,096
好的  保持联络
okay.We'll be in touch.

329
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:09,010
你没事吧
You sure you're okay?

330
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,037
没事
I'm fine.

331
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:13,060
我们走
Let's go.

332
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:06,012
联邦调查机构还在对发生在华盛顿
Federal investigations continue into the terrorist acts

333
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:08,015
及俄亥俄州汲沦谷的恐怖袭击
That have gripped the nation's capital,

334
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:10,025
进行调查
As well as the people of kidron,ohio.

335
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,029
尽管泰勒总统已经声明
Despite assurances by president taylor

336
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,069
-危机已经过去  -宝贝
In her national address that the threat has passed, hey,honey.

337
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:17,023
但从白宫得到的消息称
Sources at the white house will not confirm

338
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:21,020
还有部分主谋仍然逍遥法外
That all those responsible have been accounted for.

339
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:26,004
你确定不用我帮忙吗
Now,are you sure you're not gonna need my help?

340
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,074
我就是暂时参与下调查局的技术活
I'm just running FBI ops temporarily

341
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,087
等抓到杜巴库就没我的事了
Until they catch dubaku.

342
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,061
抓到他后  希望他能交出
Once they find him, hopefully he'll tell us

343
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:31,094
政府里所有为他工作的
The names of all the people

344
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:33,078
内鬼的名单
On his payroll that are inside our government.

345
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,054
那时我们就可以回家了
And then,we can go home?

346
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:38,011
没错
Then,we can go home.

347
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:40,002
小心点
Well,just be careful.

348
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,012
好吗
All right?

349
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,035
因为如果布坎南说得对
'cause if buchanan's right and dubaku

350
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:44,079
调查局有人为杜巴库工作
Has someone working inside the bureau...

351
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,022
我会小心的
I'll watch my back.

352
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,049
你照看好普雷斯科特
You just watch Prescott.

353
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:55,036
宝贝  妈妈要去上班了

355
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,023

如果遇到难题  记得联系我
And if you get all jammed up, you know where to find me.

361
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:14,012

I need you to cross-reference our deployments with homeland.

362
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,069
确保请求单号都能一一对应
Make sure the requisition numbers match up.

363
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:16,095
做完这些  你可以补做下
After that, you can catch up

364
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:18,042
-时间进度表  -开什么玩笑
On the hour list. Are you joking?

365
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,042
多麻烦啊   这么弱智的活儿
That is busy work, administrative crap

366
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,069
-你也分配给我做  -詹尼斯

我没时间也没兴趣

去跟你解释分配给你的任务

詹尼斯  在会议室开一个

374
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:33,050
安全虚拟专网端口
Port it to the conference room.

375
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,077
你要虚拟专网端口干嘛
Why do you need a vpn socket?

376
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,047
我从国土安全局找来个顾问

377

来检查CIP防火墙

379

好了  拿到楼下去吧

384
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:57,046
布坎南说你已经了解情况了
Buchanan said you'd be up to speed.

385
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,063
是的

386
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,066
很好
Good.

387
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,003
沃克探员和鲍尔正在追查
Agent walker and bauer are pursuing

388
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:03,063
一个可能找到杜巴库的线索

389
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:05,043
他们在去这个地址的路上

390
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:06,060
在山悦区

391
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,010
沃克探员请求卫星支持

392
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,084
怎么了  有什么不对么

393
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:14,054
我感觉有人在盯着我
I'm feeling a little exposed here.

394
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:16,021
如果外面有人为杜巴库工作
If someone out there is working for dubaku,

395
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:17,098
我们是不是该更隐蔽些呢
Shouldn't we be doing this more covertly?

396
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,022
目前为止  大家只知道
As far as anyone knows,

397
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:20,085
你是来梳理防火墙的
You're working on shoring up our firewall.

398
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,052
另外  也只剩下这个地方了
Besides,this is the only space available

399
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,082
在这  你可以访问我们所有的服务器
Where you'll have full access to our server.

400
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:26,019
我们的网络不支持远程访问
Our network doesn't port remote modules.

401
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,069
那效率多低啊
That's inefficient.

402
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:29,032
谁给你们建立的网络啊
Whoever set your network up that way

403
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:31,036
简直是外行
Didn't know what they were doing.

404
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:35,010
是我要那么设置的
I set our network up that way.

405
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,023
好吧
Okay

406
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:49,018
还有别的事情么
Something else?

407
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:52,081
你跟鲍尔工作很长时间了吧
You worked with bauer for a long time,didn't you?

408
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:55,052
7年了  时断时续
Seven years, on and off.

409
00:15:55,085 --> 00:16:00,066
你能活到现在 还真是个奇迹啊
That's impressive. That you survived the experience.

410
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,032
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

411
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:04,036
很多人都死了
Only that a lot of people didn't.

412
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:08,066
柯蒂斯·曼宁  瑞恩·查佩尔 他老婆
Curtis manning, ryan chapelle. His own wife.

413
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,083
你是说杰克老婆的死  是他的错么
Are you saying it's jack's fault his wife was killed?

414
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,020
你说呢
You tell me.

415
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,044
在我看来  杰克·鲍尔是最可靠
Jack bauer is the most trustworthy,

416
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:17,027
最值得尊敬的人  他还是我朋友
Honorable man I know, and he's my friend.

417
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,077
我劝你你还是少管闲事
Maybe you should worry less about him

418
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,051
多花点精力把你办公室
And more about the mole in your office

419
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,091
的内鬼找出来吧
Working for dubaku.

420
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:38,009
那是克罗伊·奥布赖恩吗
Is that chloe o'brian?

421
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:39,070
-在哪  -会议室里
- What?  - in the conference room.

422
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,076
克罗伊·奥布赖恩  她曾是反恐小组的
Chloe o'brian-- she was senior analyst

423
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,020
资深分析师
At ctu.

424
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,083
我上过她的课
I once took a seminar she gave.

425
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,094
她在这干嘛  -拉里说国土安全局派她过来
What's she doing here? larry said homeland sent her over

426
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:49,087
查下防火墙还有没有别的漏洞
To check for residual breaches from the firewall attack.

427
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,074
怎么了
what?

428
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:53,084
这不是她的专长啊
It just doesn't sound like her area of expertise.

429
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:55,021
另外  据我所知
Besides,as far as I know,

430
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:58,051
反恐小组解散后她就被解职了
She's been inactive since ctu was decommissioned.

431
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,006
你的护照和行程路线
Your passports and travel itinerary.

432
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:16,077
豪客西里748航班正在塔夫特机场加油
A hawker-siddley 748 is fueling at taft airfield.

433
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,070
半小时后起飞
Be ready to fly within a half hour,

434
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,064
它将带你去开曼群岛

435
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:21,070
从那到伯利兹城
You shouldn't have any trouble

436
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,087
应该没问题
Getting to belize from there.

437
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:25,014
我需要有人开车送我去机场
I need a car to the airfield and a driver.

438
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:27,014
你自己不是有车送吗
I assumed you had your own transportation.

439
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:28,078
不是我用
It's not for me.

440
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:29,088
明白了
I see.

441
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,091
是为那女孩准备的吧
It's for the girl

442
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:33,095
我不确定短时间内
Well, I'm not sure I can find

443
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,082
还可以找到可靠的人
Someone I trust on such short notice.

444
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:37,082
真的吗
Really?

445
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:40,029
吧台上的那个人
What about your man at the bar?

446
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,076
你说什么
Excuse me?

447
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,093
或者阳台上的两人之一
Or one of the two on the balcony watching now?

448
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:46,016
或者在那黑车里
Or the two in the black town car

449
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:47,093
等我出去的那两个
Waiting for me to leave?

450
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:50,043
你觉得我是傻子吗  伯内特先生
Do you think I am a fool, mr. burnett?

451
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:53,054
我知道你们现在当我是累赘
I know you people see me as a liability now.

452
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:55,007
这些人是来保护您的
These men are here to guarantee

453
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,071
上校  没别的意思
Your safety,colonel, not to threaten it.

454
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,084
保护我
Guarantee my safety.

455
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:01,024
真不错
How nice.

456
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:04,034
还故作真诚
And said with such sincerity.

457
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:11,015
你听好了
I want you to take this message back with you.

458
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,045
我离开这个国家时
If anything should happen to me

459
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,096
如果有什么意外发生
On my way out of the country--

460
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:17,089
事故或者蓄意谋杀
An accident or an assassination attempt,anything--

461
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,066
比如你慷慨捐赠的飞机
If the plane that you

462
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,070
爆炸了的话
Were so generous to donate decides to explode,

463
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,083
所有与我相关的人员和银行交易记录
A data file with all the names and bank transactions

464
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,017
都会被送到司法部查处
Of all those involved will be sent to the justice department.

465
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:28,094
完全没有这个必要
That is completely unnecessary.

466
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:30,017
上面所说一切
The same holds true

467
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,014
同样适用于玛丽卡·道诺索
If anything should happen to marika donoso.

468
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:34,081
我发誓  她对此事一无所知
I swear to you, she knows nothing of this.

469
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,038
她不会威胁到你们
She is no threat to you.

470
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:39,018
别忘了提醒你的司机
Make sure your driver knows this before he brings her to me.

471
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:42,055
明白我的意思吗
Do you understand what I am saying?

472
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,042
我需要一个肯定的答复
I want you to tell me that you understand

473
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,032
这样才能确保
What I am saying to you, so there

474
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:47,032
万无一失
Will be no mistakes.

475
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:48,076
明白了
I understand.

476
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,086
很好
Good.

477
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,043
伯纳特先生  同雇佣兵合作
The one thing I have learned

478
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:57,013
我学到一件事  就是他们
In the company of mercenaries, mr. burnett,is that ultimately,

479
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:59,050
只管自己的死活
They care about nothing but their own survival.

480
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,004
好运
Good day.

481
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,072
正如我所料
I was right.

482
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:16,069
杜巴库猜到我们要干掉他
Dubaku suspected we were gonna take him out,and apparently,

483
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:18,059
他收集了证据来保护自己
He assembled evidence to use as an insurance policy.

484
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,086
我们得让他顺利地离开
We need to make sure he gets out of the country

485
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:21,096
踏上逃亡之路
And safely into exile.

486
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,036
不然我们就完蛋了
Otherwise, we're all compromised.

487
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,046
我去做下安排
I'll make the calls.

488
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:32,000
你干嘛
What are you doing?

489
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:34,007
罗莎
Rosa.

490
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,094
你要去哪
Where are you going?

491
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:37,031
罗莎  听我说
Rosa,listen to me.

492
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:39,004
我们要离开这
We're going away from here.

493
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:41,001
我们所有人
All of us.

494
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,081
什么所有人
Well,what do you mean,all?

495
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,045
塞缪尔向我坦白了
Samuel told me the truth.

496
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:49,042
如你所料  他是非法移民
He's an illegal, just like you thought.

497
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,069
他必须得离开
He has to leave the country,

498
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:53,032
我同意和他一起走
And I've agreed to go with him.

499
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,062
你要离开我
You're leaving me?

500
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:58,006
不  只是分开一会  你也会过去的
No,no,only for a short time. you're gonna come,too.

501
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,026
塞缪尔都安排好了
Samuel's made plans.

502
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:00,056
我们会去
We're gonna live

503
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:02,026
伯利兹城和他一起住
With him in his home in belize.

504
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,030
玛丽卡
Marika...

505
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,067
他在向你撒谎
He's lying to you.

506
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,024
他没有
He's not.

507
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:08,047
我不会同意的
I won't let you do this!

508
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,034
天呐  罗莎
My god,rosa.

509
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:13,014
一直以来都是我在照顾你
I have taken care of you my entire life.

510
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:15,034
我为你牺牲了一切
I've sacrificed everything for you.

511
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,075
你为什么就不让我和他在一起
Why can't you let me have this?

512
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,011
我不相信他
I don't trust him.

513
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,085
任何喜欢我的男人
Oh,well, you never liked any man

514
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,048
你都不喜欢
Who's ever shown an interest in me.

515
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:23,012
每次我的幸福来临时
Every chance I've ever had at happiness,

516
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,065
你都会想方设法把它毁掉
You found some way of ruining it.

517
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:26,029
-这次不行  -玛丽卡
- But not this time.  - Marika,

518
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:27,059
我求你了  听我说
I'm begging you, listen to me.

519
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,062
-不  -玛丽卡  求你了
- No.  - Marika,please.

520
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:29,062
别走
Stop.

521
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,003
闪开
Move!

522
00:20:31,003 --> 00:20:32,033
玛丽卡  求你了
Marika,please.

523
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,050
听我说  求你了  玛丽
Listen to me. I'm begging you,marik...

联邦调查局  不许动

525
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:37,007

526
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,013
跪下
On your knees!

527
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:39,070
你们两个  双手交叉
Both of you, put your hands

528
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,014
放到脑后
Behind your head, interlock your fingers.

529
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:42,040
现在
Now!

530
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,070
不许动
Do not move.

531
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,071
这安全了
We're clear.

532
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:50,005
杜巴库在哪
Where is dubaku?

533
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:52,018
-谁  -别和我耍花招
- Who?  - don't play games with me!

534
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,045
埃克·杜巴库  我们从银行账户追踪到这
Ike dubaku-- we traced bank accounts to this address.

535
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,068
他在哪
Now,where is he?

536
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:58,029
我们不知道你在说什么
We don't know who you're talking about.

537
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:00,046
我来帮你们回忆下
Let me make try and make this easier for you.

538
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:02,019
你认识他吗
You know this man?

539
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:05,073
不
No.

540
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:07,010
你撒谎
You're lying to me.

541
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,023
你为什么撒谎
Why are you lying to me?!

542
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,087
让我看看
Let me see.

543
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,039
就是他  我们认识
That's him-- we know him.

544
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,066
他称自己是安博 塞缪尔·安博
He calls himself aboa, samuel aboa.

545
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,026
-罗莎  闭嘴  -她正要去见他
- Rosa,shut up!  - she was going to meet him to leave me

546
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:21,053
你要去哪见他
Where were you gonna meet him?

547
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:22,090
你要去哪
Where were you going?!

548
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,023
我不清楚
I don't know.

549
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:26,087
-你怎么认识他的  你是他手下吗  -不

-你是他手下吗 -不

551

你知道他都干了些什么吗
You know what he's doing here in this country?

552
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:38,091
你知道
Do you have any idea...

553
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:41,026
他是个什么样的人吗
What this man is?

554
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,073
他是我的一切
He's everything to me.

我不知道行不行
I don't know if that's possible.

用她的手机当发射器
We could use her cell phone as a transponder.

703
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,052
你想把这姑娘送到杜巴库那去吗
You want to send that girl to dubaku?

704
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:26,083
我们别无选择
We don't have another choice.

705
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,033
-杰克  -想抓住杜巴库
Jack. you want to get dubaku,

706
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:30,037
这就是我们的机会
This is our shot.

707
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,081
玛丽卡
Marika?

708
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:41,074
我想请你帮个忙
I have a favor to ask of you.

709
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:43,074
我们不会强迫你这么做
We can't make you do this.

710
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:46,065
不过车来的时候  我们想让你和司机走
But when the car arrives, we would like you to go

711
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:49,025
那样我们就能跟着你找到杜巴库
With the driver so that we could follow you back to dubaku.

712
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,098
什么意思
Oh,what-what are you talking about?

713
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:52,092
你想让她去他那里和他见面吗
You want her to go to him and face him?

714
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:55,042
这是能抓到他的
It's the only chance we have of finding him before

715
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:58,010
-唯一机会了  -我去
He disappears forever. I'll do it.

716
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,009
不
No!

717
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,076
我是你姐
I'm your older sister,

718
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:03,036
我不准你去
And I won't allow it.

719
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:05,036
这事由不得你  罗莎
It's not your decision to make,rosa.

720
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:08,004
是我自己的决定
It's mine.

721
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:11,068
难道这么做不对吗
Ain't it the right thing to do.

722
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,075
把你手机给我
Let me see your phone.

723
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:19,045
你要做什么
What are you doing?

724
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,081
查看你的安全码
Getting your sid number.

725
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:22,062
这样我们就能追踪到你
It's how we're going to track you.

726
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:24,035
你不是孤身一人去那
You're not gonna be out there alone.

727
00:29:24,036 --> 00:29:25,095
沃克探员和我都会跟着你
Agent walker and I will be following you.

728
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,072
我们会在你身后一里内
We'll never be more than a mile behind.

729
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:29,092
一旦你到达目的地
As soon as you reach the destination--

730
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:31,026
我们就出击
That's when we'll move in.

731
00:29:31,027 --> 00:29:32,086
玛丽卡
Marika.

732
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,079
一里  你疯了吗
A mile! are you crazy?

733
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,033
罗莎  够了
Rosa,enough.

734
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:37,090
你听到他说的话了
You heard what he said.

735
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:39,033
他是个杀人恶魔
He's a murderer!

736
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,010
-他会伤害你  -他不会
He could hurt you. he won't.

737
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:44,064
罗莎  我本该听你的话
Rosa, i should have listened to you.

738
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:46,074
亲爱的
Sweetheart.

739
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,037
你曾警告过我的
You warned me about him.

740
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:50,014
听着  我之所以那么说
Listen,the only reason

741
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:52,095
是因为我很嫉妒
Why I said those things was because I was jealous.

742
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:55,092
我不想失去你
And I didn't want to lose you.

743
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,005
拉里  我是杰克
Larry,it's jack.

744
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,012
蕾妮说有人在做战术支持  是吧
Renee said you had someone running operations support?

745
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:02,036
是的  她在这里
Yeah. she's right here.

746
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:04,030
我把免提打开了
I'll put you on speaker.

747
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:06,006
杰克  我是克洛伊
Jack,it's chloe.

748
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:07,036
需要什么
What do you need?

749
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:08,066
要用多久才能为
How long's it gonna take you

750
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:10,080
一部手机建立一个卫星信标
To set up a sat beacon for a mobile line?

751
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:12,017
一般几秒钟就行
Usually a few seconds,

752
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,093
可在他们的这种落后的系统上
But with the backward way they have the system set up,

753
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:15,027
至少要几分钟
It's gonna take at least a few minutes.

754
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:17,030
好吧  我把安全码告诉你
Okay,well,let me give you the sid number.

755
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:20,051
1-c-4-8-6-8-9.
1-c-4-8-6-8-9.

756
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,091
收到没有
You got it?

757
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:23,011
收到
Got it.

758
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:24,051
杰克  你在追踪谁
Jack,who are you tracking?

759
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:26,018
与杜巴库有染的一个女人
A woman who's involved with dubaku.

760
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:28,035
他正派车来接她
He's sending a car to take her to him.

761
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,058
她是他的手下吗
She's one of his operatives?

762
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:30,098
不是
No.

763
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:33,080
比那复杂的多
It's-it's more complicated than that.

764
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,060
亚瑟  你不会再找到一家公司
Arthur,you're not going to find another firm

765
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:16,017
能为像你这样小型的药品公司
That's done more high-level consulting work

766
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:19,000
做如此高级的咨询了
For a relatively small pharmaceutical company like yours.

767
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,034
我的公司曾替州长制定计划
Remember,my firm helped the governor craft a plan

768
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:23,044
在他最后的预算改革中
To swap property taxes for sales taxes

769
00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:25,011
用消费税替换财产税
In his last budget reform.

770
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:27,011
你可别说没给戴克斯特·卡尔省下大笔钞票
Tell me that didn't save dexter-carr a bundle.

771
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,011
确实如此  奥利维亚
Oh,it did,olivia.

772
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,035
可鉴于我要雇的人是你
But since I'm specifically looking to hire you,

773
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:33,055
我就要知道你能做什么
I need to know what you yourself can do.

774
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:34,095
你需要我做什么
Whatever you need.

775
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:36,095
你看过我履历  知道我的成就
You know my accomplishments, yove seen my resume.

776
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:39,096
我是指你的家庭背景
I mean white house influence.

777
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,089
在白宫的影响力
Considering your family.

778
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,006
我们不是说客  亚瑟
We're not lobbyists,arthur.

779
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:46,030
合同里写的明明白白
It states that clearly in the contract.

780
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,093
我只是觉得你能和总统美言几句
I just thought,since you had the president's ear...

781
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:50,013
不能
I don't.

782
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:51,083
这有关系吗
Is that going to be a problem?

783
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:53,071
打扰了  泰勒小姐吗
Excuse me,ms. taylor?

784
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:56,064
我们认识吗
Do I know you?

785
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:58,077
我叫亚伦·皮尔斯
My name is aaron pierce.

786
00:31:58,078 --> 00:32:01,048
你办公室的人告诉我你在这
your office told me you would be here

787
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:03,049
总统派我来找您
I've been dispatched at the request of the president.

788
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:04,098
你的证件上写着
Your credentials

789
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:06,018
你已经退休了  皮尔斯先生
You've retired, mr. pierce.

790
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:08,018
或许没人通知您
Perhaps no one informed you

791
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:10,022
几个月前  我拒绝了特勤局的保护
I refused secret service protection months ago.

792
00:32:10,023 --> 00:32:11,075
这我知道  女士
I'm aware of that,ma'am.

793
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:13,079
可现在情况特殊
This is a special circumstance.

794
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,083
你也看到了  我现在有点忙
Well,as you can see,i'm a little busy right now.

795
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:18,003
现在不合适
This isn't a good time.

796
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,073
抱歉  可我必须这样
I'm sorry,but I have to insist.

797
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:21,083
-真的  没关系  -不
-It's really... it's all right. -no.

798
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:23,083
不  不行
No,it's not all right.

799
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:25,073
我妈有什么重要的事
What is it that's so impornt

800
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:29,017
非要在做生意的时候找我
For my mother to steal me away while I'm trying to do business?

801
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:30,065
这我不便透露  女士
I'm not at liberty to say,ma'am.

802
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:32,067
事关机密
That information is confidential.

803
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:35,041
奥利维亚  我们可以以后再谈
Olivia,we can pick this up at a later time.

804
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:36,075
亚瑟  等等
Arthur,wait...

805
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:39,046
保持联络
We'll be in touch.

806
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,052
女士  请
Ma'am,please?

807
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:45,002
除非你告诉我什么事
I'm not going anywhere with you

808
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:47,070
否则我不会和你走
Until you tell me what this is about.

809
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,009
是你父亲  泰勒小姐

他中枪了

现正在西阿灵顿医院做手术

813
00:32:57,084 --> 00:33:01,018
这些都没对外公布
None of this is public knowledge.

814
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:03,071
上帝啊  我

815
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:07,002
我的车就在外面
My car is just outside.

816
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:15,055
打扰一下  西恩
Excuse me,sean.

817
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:17,092
能把服务器的数字测试密钥借我吗

818
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:19,069
做什么
Why?

819
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,069
拉里要的
Larry asked for it.

820
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,013
是防火墙评测之类的事
Something to do with the firewall assessment

821
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:25,069
要是拉里想要  为什么不直接找我

822
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,057

823
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:32,001
-不如我去问他  -不
Maybe I ought to go ask him. no.

824

好吧
Okay.

825
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:37,047
我觉得拉里把克洛伊·奥布莱恩
I think that larry brought in this woman,

826
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,060
这女人带来顶替我
Chloe o'brian,to replace me.

827
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:40,080
我只想知道 他们在干什么
And I just want to get a bead On what they're working on.

828
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:42,054
-仅此而已  -仅此而已吗
That's all. that's all?

829
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:44,027
说不定我们会丢掉饭碗
That's enough to lose us both our jobs.

830
00:33:44,028 --> 00:33:47,058
我看我还是别包庇你了
Well,maybe I should stop covering for you.

831
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,038
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

832
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,054
艾丽卡
Erika

833
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:52,021
还有你这个要性不要命的家伙
And you,and your little sexual indiscretions.

834
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:54,095
这些事我都没和拉里还有你太太说过
I've said nothing to larry or your wife.

835
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:57,046
你也不想我这么做吧
I'm sure you'd like me to keep it that way.

836
00:34:21,052 --> 00:34:23,091
知道吗  你是个小贱人
You're a little bitch, you know that?

837
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:26,062
你是个小贱男

838
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,050

00:34:45,032 --> 00:34:46,084
玛丽卡
Marika...

842
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:49,055
我们得走了
We got to go.

843
00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:53,089
没事的
It's all right.

844
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,039
你
You--

845
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,039
联邦调查局的
Fbi.

846
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,073
要保证她的安全  听到了吗
You keep her safe,you hear me?

847
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:07,044
我们会的
We will.

848
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:18,004
我好害怕
I'm really scared.

849
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:19,021
你不会有事
You're going to be fine.

850
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:20,058
记住  我们就在你身后
Just remember, we're right behind you.

851
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:22,032
在这里等着
Move up here.

852
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:25,055
听着  如果遇到麻烦
Now,listen, if you get into trouble,

853
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,038
-就播1-0  -不
You can signal us by dialing one-zero... no.

854
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,002
不  不要那样做
No,i don'want you to do that.

855
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,032
不要做任何事
Don't do anything that's going to raise

856
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:32,035
-否则司机会起疑  -好的
The suspicion of the driver. okay.

857
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:34,036
准备好了吗
You ready?

858
00:35:34,037 --> 00:35:35,036
嗯  好了
I'm ready. yeah.

859
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:36,036
-好  -好
Okay. okay.

860
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:39,007
好
Okay.

861
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:47,034
你这是干什么
What the hell are you doing?

862
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:49,037
她很害怕
She was scared.

863
00:35:49,038 --> 00:35:50,081
我只想让她知道除我们外
I wanted her to know there was another option

864
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:52,031
她还有别的选择
Than waiting for us to swoop in.

865
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:54,094
如果想找到杜巴库  就别无选择
If we're going to find dubaku, there are no other options,

866
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:56,038
明白吗
You understand?

867
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,091
拜托  你也指挥过这样的行动
Come on,you've run operations like this.

868
00:35:57,092 --> 00:35:59,001
这次完全没有战术支持
Not without full tactical support,

869
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:00,025
至少要有两组人作为后背增援
And at least two backup units on the scene.

870
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:02,038
她没有丝毫保障  杰克  我不赞成
She's naked out there,jack. I don't like it.

871
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,065
这事由不得你
This isn't about you.

872
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:06,056
这是她和杜巴库的事
This is about her and dubaku

873
00:36:06,057 --> 00:36:08,059
听着  世事无常
Listen,life gets ugly,

874
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,059
好人没好报  这就是现实
Innocent people get hurt-- that's a reality.

875
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,063
至少她选择参与这件事
At least she got to make a choice

876
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:13,090
做正确的事
To be involved, to do the right thing.

877
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:15,013
单就这点
Which is a lot more

878
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,080
就比杜巴库其他的帮凶强
Than I can say for dubaku's other victims.

879
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:19,037
我们只有一个任务  就是找到杜巴库
We have one job here-- that's to get dubaku.

880
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:21,041
其他的事  不要多想
Outside of that don't get involved.

881
00:36:24,002 --> 00:36:26,001
克洛伊  车到了
Chloe, the car's here.

00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:46,093
锁定他们了吗
Are you locked in?

887
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:50,027
嗯  他们由14街向南行驶
Yeah,i've got them heading south on 14th.

888
00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:52,060
能把追踪图像传到
Can you upload the tracking grid

889
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:53,080
沃克探员的PDA上吗
To agent walker's pda?

890
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:55,037
不行  我会指示你们
No,i'll have to direct you.

891
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,037
-跟紧点  -明白
Just keep us close. Understood.

892
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:59,031
由14街向右转

还有多远
How much further?

00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:06,083
继续向西行进  穿过罕布什尔大街
Continuing west on our street, crossing hampshire avenue.

896
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,076
你与目标不到一里远
You're less than a mile behind the target car.

897
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:10,096
收到
Copy that.

898
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:13,000
目标转弯
Target car is turning,

899
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,057
前往康涅狄格
Left on connecticut.

900
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:16,067
好  在杜邦转盘环岛
Okay,rounding dupont circle.

901
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:19,017
莫斯探员  目标的北方区域
Agent moss,is there anything in the northern quad of the grid

902
00:38:19,017 --> 00:38:21,004
是否有可以起飞的地方
That would indicate where dubaku can hide a plane

903
00:38:21,004 --> 00:38:22,031
不
No.

904
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:23,058
不确定
Nothing definitive.

905
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:25,098
有很多可以起飞的地点
Could be any number of launch sites.

906
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,011
啊
Whoa! whoa! whoa!

907
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:29,098
怎么回事  出什么事了
What was it? what happened?

908
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:33,069
杰克  我们有麻烦
Jack,we've got a problem.

909
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:34,072
什么事  克洛伊
Chloe,what's wrong?

910
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:36,079
刚失去追踪图像
We just lost the tracking grid.

911
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,089
-什么  -我也不清楚
What?! i-i don't know.

912
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:38,099
突然断线
It just suddenly glitched out.

913
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,023
千万不能跟丢了
We can't afford to lose them.

914
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:41,086
杰克  我发誓要保证她的安全
Jack,i gave this woman my word we'd protect her.

915
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,046
我知道  克洛伊  重新连接
I know. chloe,get it back up.

916
00:38:43,046 --> 00:38:45,003
我们在尽全力  杰克
We're doing our best, here,jack.

917
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:47,040
等等
Wait.

918
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,097
连接恢复
It's back up.

919
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:50,020
怎么回事
What the hell happened?

920
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,030
不知道  我正在运行诊断程序
I don't know,i'm running a diagnostic right now.

921
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,081
杰克  他们由马萨诸塞大街
Jack,they're moving southeast

922
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,014
向东南方向行驶
On massachusetts avenue.

923
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:56,048
你与目标只有半里远
You've closed the gap to about a half mile.

924
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:57,081
最好后撤些
You may want to back off a little bit.

925
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:58,091
好  收到
Okay, copy that.

926
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:00,031
不好
Oh,no.

00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,075
怎么
What?

928

刚才有人在监视系统
Somebody was in the system.

929
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:04,052
什么  什么意思
What? what are you talking about?

930
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,018
这间办公室里的某人
I'm saying someone in this office

931
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,052
刚刚映像了我的终端
Was mirroring my terminal.

932
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:10,009
他一定知道了我们在做什么
Whoever it was knows exactly what we were doing.

933
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:19,053
能进行反追踪吗
Can you backtrace the breach?

934
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:21,057
不行  对方切断了连接
No. the link was severed.

935
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:23,053
可能来自任何地方
It could have come from anywhere.

杰克  你听到了吗

看来我们可能有安全漏洞
It looks like we might have a security breach.

938
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,025
有人刚刚监视了我们的通讯
Someone is mirroring our comm.

939
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:35,068
杰克  到处都是警察
Jack, they're coming from all sides.

940
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:38,052
拉里  我们这里也有情况
Larry,we got a situation here.

941
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:40,005
什么事

942
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,005
警察在拦我们的车
I got Metro PDs trying to build a roadblock around us.

943
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,029
什么
What?

944
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:45,012
他们为什么这么做
Why would they be doing that?

945
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:47,099
不知道  帮我甩掉他们
I don't know. just get 'em off us!

946
00:39:58,097 --> 00:40:00,071
拉里  想想办法
Larry,do something!

947
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:01,097

00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:03,024
给我接市警总局
Connect me with metro district command.

949
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:05,008
举起手  举起手
Hands in the air! hands in the air!

950
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:06,011
我叫杰克·鲍尔
My name is jack bauer,

951
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:07,091
与我随行的是

先生  把手放在身后

957
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:21,013
拉里  快想想办法

958
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:23,013
警长  我要你立即释放这些人
Captain,you've got to release these people immediately!

959
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:25,030
不  不  肯定是误会
No. no,that is a mistake

960
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,057
我们没对他们发布拘捕令
No federal warrants have been issued for them!

961
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,097
不  发过

有份拘捕令要求追捕那辆车
A warrant was called in for the vehicle.

963
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,014

需采取必要手段进行抓捕

965
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:34,098
谁批准的
Issued by whom?

966
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,071
调查局  没有授权  不过识别码正确
FBI, this office, there is no authorization, But the routing code's real.

967
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:41,015
肯定是这的人做的
This was definitely done by someone here.

968
00:40:41,015 --> 00:40:43,065
玛丽卡的车向东上了N大街
Marika's car just turned east onto n street.

969
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,012
警长  听好
Captain,listen carelly.

970
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:47,012
我是负责这次行动的联邦探员
I'm the special agent in charge of this operation,

971
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:49,015

不行
No.

973
00:40:50,066 --> 00:40:53,013
我没时间去层层汇报
No,i don't have time to deal with our chain of command.

974
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:55,083
我要你立即放人
You need to release these people right now!

975
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,037
谢谢
Hey. thank you.

976
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:02,037
奥布莱恩要顶替你吗
So is o'brian here to replace you?

977
00:41:02,037 --> 00:41:03,080
不知道  不是吧
I don't know. no.

978
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,064
拉里在让她与杰克·鲍尔
Larry's using her for some kind of

979
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:07,061
进行秘密行动
Covert operation with jack bauer.

980
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:09,021
他们在追踪前往杜巴库那里的车辆
They're tracking a car to dubaku.

981
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:11,028
为什么不让我们知道这些事
Why would he keep us in the dark about something

982
00:41:11,028 --> 00:41:12,061
不知道
Like that? I don't know.

983
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:15,055
不知道  可我不喜欢这样
I don't know, but I don't like it.

984
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:28,056
我搞定了鲍尔和沃克
Hey, i took care of bauer and walker.

985
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:29,080
他们已经被扣住了
They're pinned down.

986
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,036
为什么现在才告诉我
Why am I being brought in on this so last minute?

987
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:34,040
莫斯正在独自指挥这次行动
Moss is running this op on his own.

988
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,064
我好不容易
It took me some time

989
00:41:36,064 --> 00:41:38,064
才窃听到他的电话
To tap into his phone line.

990
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:40,021
他在和警署通话
He's on with metro right now.

991
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:42,021
你能切断他们的
Can you at least disable the tracking signal

992
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,051
追踪信号吗
They're using to follow the girl?

993
00:41:43,051 --> 00:41:45,008
不行  在我这里不行
No,not from my console.

994
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:46,091
不过从频率上来看
But judging by the frequency,they're using

995
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:48,015
他们正用她的手机来追踪她
Her cell as the tracker.

996
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:49,018
好的
All right.

997
00:41:49,018 --> 00:41:50,048
干得好
Good work.

998
00:41:50,048 --> 00:41:54,009
你说过一旦杜巴库达到目的
You told me that once dubaku served his purpose,

999
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:55,019
你就会把他干掉
You'd take him out.

1000
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:56,076
为什么还在帮他
Why are we still helping him?

1001
00:41:56,076 --> 00:41:59,009
他威胁说会利用手中的名单
He's threatening to expose us using the database he's kept

1002
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,049
和相关账户举报我们
With nes and accounts of everyone involved.

1003
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,073
包括我吗
Including mine?

1004
00:42:04,073 --> 00:42:05,093
谁都跑不掉
I mean,everyone.

1005
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:07,020
我们不知道文件在哪
We don't know where the file is,

1006
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,017
所以只能祈祷他能得偿所愿
So you just get pray that he gets away.

1007
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:21,098
对  与今早的
Yes,it has to do with the terrorist threats

1008
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:25,008
恐怖袭击有关
That happened this morning.

1009
00:42:35,073 --> 00:42:36,080
喂
Hello?

1010

你有麻烦了

什么事
What is it?

1012
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,020
调查局已经招降了你女友
Your girlfriend's been turned by the fbi.

1013
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,004
我不信
I don't believe you.

1014
00:42:43,004 --> 00:42:44,070
他们在半小时前和她见面
They met with her half hour ago,

1015
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,007
告诉了她  你的真面目
Told her who you really are.

1016
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:47,087
不可能
That's impossible.

1017
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:49,004
玛丽卡不会这么做
Marika would never do this.

1018
00:42:49,004 --> 00:42:50,091
是局里的内线亲口告诉我的
I got it from our source inside the bureau,

1019
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:51,094
不会有错

1020
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:53,048
她答应带他们去你那

1021
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,041
利用她手机作为跟踪器

1022
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,065
我的内线已经设法
Look,my source managed

1023
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:58,028
暂时干扰了他们的监控
To stall their surveillance team for a while,

1024
00:42:58,028 --> 00:43:00,045
不过你得立即去机场
But you need to get to the airfield immediately.

1025
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,092
我给司机打电话

1026
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:03,019
让他干掉她

不  交给我
No. I'll do it.

1028
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:07,063
上校  我说了  他们在跟踪她
Colonel, i told you, they are tracking her.

1029
00:43:07,063 --> 00:43:08,096
如果你让她来找你
If you let her come to you,

1030
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:10,040
你可能就走不掉了
