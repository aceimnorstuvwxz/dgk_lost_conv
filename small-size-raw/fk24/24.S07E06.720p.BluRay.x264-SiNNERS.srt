48
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:16,066
不得已的话  可以从地方上抽调人员

49
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,006
我们要增加搜寻范围

50
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:19,090
和地铁警员合作并建立一个
Coordinate with metro police to set up a point-by-point grid

51
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,037

我想让所有这些搜查
I want to back all of this up

54
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:25,094
都有卫星同步扫描支援
with synchronized satellite sweeps.

55
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:28,004
-我会尽力  -什么意思
- I'll do what I can. - What does that mean?

56
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,038
每次我需要什么  他们都会瞎扯些
Well,every time I ask for something,they pull their

57
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:31,061
事关机密之类的屁话搪塞
cloak-and-dagger nonsense.

58
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:32,055
于是我不得不求爷爷告奶奶地申请
I have to get approval

59
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:33,078
只为了每次获得那一丁点的小资料
for every little scrap of data.

60
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:34,075
詹尼斯  这对谁来说都不容易

64
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:41,039
下一场袭击已迫在眉睫
We know that another attack could be imminent.

65
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,012
唯一阻止它的办法是找到阿尔梅达和鲍尔
The only way to stop it is to find Almeida and Bauer

66
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,069
并拿到CIP装置
and take control of the CIP device.

67
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:54,060
可能有人还不知道  我跟你们说
Um... for those of you who haven't heard,

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,084
蕾妮被这些人绑架

69
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:04,014
我们是她的最后一线希望

73
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,026
好
Okay.

74
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:18,026
沃克已经没有利用价值
Walker is extraneous.

75
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:20,026
你到我这里之前做了她
Kill her before you get here.

76
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:21,069
好  我们很快会和你会合
Okay,we'll be with you soon.

77
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,003
手脚麻利点

79
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,073
好好分析这段录音  找到他们
Been combing through it,looking for a tag

80
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,033
泄露出来的地点
that will give up their location.

81
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,030
-目前为止还一无所获  -还有谁
- So far,nothing. - Is there anybody else

82
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,074
能来帮你忙
you can put on this?

83
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:33,067
拉里  不值得这样
Larry,I don't think it's worth it.

84
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,014
-这里面没什么情报了  -好吧
- There's nothing here. - All right.

85
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,094
好吧  去帮詹尼斯忙国安局的事
Fine,help Janis coordinate with NSA.

86
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,058
拉里  对于蕾妮的事  我感到很遗憾
I'm sorry about Renee,Larry.

87
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:40,001
她是个出色的探员
She was a good agent.

88
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,088
她还生死未卜
We don't know that she's dead yet!

89
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:45,028
-明白吗  -明白
- All right? - All right

90
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:13,015
你确定就在这里吗
Are you sure this is it?

91
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:14,071
她会缺氧窒息
She's going to run out of air.

92
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,068
托尼说她就在挖土机旁边
Tony said near the backhoe.

93
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,068
这里  在这里

96
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:38,024
没呼吸了  给我肾上腺素
She's not breathing. Give me the adrenaline.

97
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:07,073
没事的
It's all right.

98
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,070
你没事  你没事
You're okay... you're okay.

99
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,020
你们是谁
Who are you?

100
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,007
杰克的同事
We're working with Jack.

101
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,084
他让我们到这里来找你
He told us where to find you.

102
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:18,018
你会好的
It's gonna be okay.

103
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:22,038
深呼吸  你会没事的
Take deep breaths. You're gonna be okay.

104
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:32,059
我们快到约定地点了
We're close to the rendezvous point.

105
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,043
你还有多久能到
What's your eta?

106
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:39,003
好
Good.

107
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:41,063
一会见
We'll see you then.

108
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:51,058
都安排好了
It's all set.

109
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:54,051
尼科尔斯正带着钻石赶过来
Nichols is on his way with the diamonds.

110
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,082
杰克  你是不是有心事
Is something bothering you,Jack?

111
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,083
不  我在想
No,I was wondering...

112
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:10,006
你干嘛不告诉托尼你是怎么把他弄出反恐组的
why you never told Tony how you got him out of CTU.

113
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,000
你是怎么做到的
How did you do it?

114
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,017
克里斯多佛·安德森
Christopher Anderson.

115
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:24,058
克里斯多佛·安德森当时想杀他
Christopher Anderson tried to kill him.

116
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:26,071
安德森没想杀托尼
Anderson had no intention of killing Tony.

117
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:31,052
他给他注射的时候故意没扎进动脉
He purposely missed the artery when he injected him.

118
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:33,019
这样刚好足以放慢他的心跳
It was just enough to slow his heart

119
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,025
让人以为他已经死了
to the point where you'd think that he was dead.

120
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:39,092
我的任务是  把他抢救回来
My job was to...extract and revive him and...

121
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,073
利用他来对付你
use him against you.

122
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:44,090
然后呢
And?

123
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,017
等到他的生命体征稳定时
By the time I stabilized him,

124
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:49,094
你已经杀了安德森
you had already killed Anderson.

125
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,060
任务失败
Mission had failed.

126
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,067
于是我们销声匿迹
So,my team went dark.

127
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:56,031
他为何不放托尼走
Why did he just let Tony go?

128
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:59,068
托尼自愿留下的
Tony chose to stay with us.

129
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:06,049
他心中充满了仇恨的怒火
He was consumed with hatred and anger

130
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:09,082
因米歇尔之死怀恨政府
over what the government had done to Michelle.

131
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,049
不管怎样  我找他谈了谈
Anyway... I talked to him.

132
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:22,020
更重要的是  我听他倾诉
More importantly,I listened to him.

133
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:27,021
很快  我们便一致认为
Pretty soon,we came to realize that...

134
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,061
我的想法是对的
I was right.

135
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,098
什么想法
About what?

136
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:35,015
行事规则已经改变
That the rules had changed.

137
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:42,042
连荣誉也消失殆尽
And there was nothing such as honor left.

138
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:49,013
我们必须相互扶持
That we would have to take care of each other.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,053
情同手足
Like brothers.

140
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:56,060
爱默生先生
Mr. Emerson.

141
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,087
什么事
Yeah?

142
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,087
快到了
We're almost there.

143
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:02,067
我们如何交易
How is the deal gonna go down?

144
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,064
别担心  杰克  你马上就会知道
Don't worry,Jack. You're about to find out.

145
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:22,036
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

146
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:26,033
好了
Yeah.

147
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,017
你确定
Are you sure?

148
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,053
是的
Yeah.

149
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,056
你去和利特法克把守大门
Go help Litvak with the door.

150
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,063
-把马托波夫妇带出来  -好的
-Go get the Matobos. -Yeah.

151
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:15,035
你最好告诉我  这到底是怎么回事
You better tell me what the hell's going on.

152
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:16,095
放下枪  戴维
Drop the gun,David.

153
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:19,055
我不知道你想干什么
You know,I just couldn't figure out your play,

154
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:23,019
所以我给你时间  让你说清楚
so I tried to give you some time so you'd come clean,

155
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,092
因为我们亲如兄弟  对吧  托尼
'cause we are like brothers,right,Tony?

156
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:26,066
把枪放下  戴维
Put the gun down,David.

157
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,063
你真以为我会让你
You actually think that I would let you

158
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,083
抢走我的钻石吗
steal those diamonds from me?

159
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,000
与钻石无关
It's not about the diamonds.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,090
而是残杀无辜的生命
It's about killing innocent people.

161
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,013
我必须阻止你
I can't let you finish this.

162
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,030
开枪
Take a shot.

163
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,034
放下武器  否则我杀了他
Put down the weapon or I will kill him.

164
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,054
托尼  开枪
Tony,take a shot!

165
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:41,004
-闭嘴  杰克  -放下枪  托尼
- Shut up,Jack!  - Put it down,Tony,

166
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:42,091
-否则我杀了他  -戴维  我不想杀你
- Or he's dead.  - David,I don't want to kill you,

167
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:43,098
-但我不会手软  -去死吧  托尼
- but I will.  - Damn it,Tony,

168
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:45,031
放下
Drop the...

169
00:09:58,072 --> 00:09:59,089
你没事吧
You okay?

170
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:01,036
没事
Yeah.

171
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:03,063
戴维
David.

172
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,067
你说鲍尔和阿尔梅达
Okay,you say that Bauer and Almeida

173
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,091
都是卧底  可是反恐小组已经被撤销了
are working undercover,but CTU has been shut down,

174
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:19,061
如果你说的属实
So,I mean,if you're telling the truth,

175
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:21,001
这项行动由谁主持
who's running this operation?

176
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,008
我们
We are.

177
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:23,092
我们独自行动
We're not working with any agency.

178
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:27,019
我们认为多处国家机关
We believe there's been widespread infiltration of the

179
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,006
被杜巴库和朱玛政权收买
government by Dubaku and the Juma regime.

180
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:31,036
好吧
Okay.

181
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:32,086
我要联系我的上司
I need to contact my boss.

182
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:34,073
-告诉他我平安无事  -不行
- He needs to know that I'm okay. - You can't do that.

183
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:35,096
为什么
Why not?

184
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:38,010
杜巴库在联调局内有眼线
Dubaku has informants in the FBI.

185
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,047
如果他们得知你还活着
If they find out you're alive,

186
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:42,003
他们就会发现杰克的敌对身份
They'll know Jack is working against them.

187
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,020
你不知道能相信谁
You don't know who you can trust.

188
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,037
我相信莫斯探员
I can trust agent Moss.

189
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:46,057
你没听明白吗
You're not listening to me.

190
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:48,047
你不能联系联调局
You cannot contact the FBI.

191
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,068
那会威胁到本次行动
You will jeopardize this operation,

192
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:51,025
我不会允许的
and I won't let you do that.

193
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,031
你不是我上司  拉里才是
Well,I don't work for you; I work for Larry.

194
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:54,038
把电话给我
Now give me a phone.

195
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:56,088
拜托你坐着别动
Sit still,please.

196
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,015
行动接近尾声了
We're nearing the endgame.

197
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:01,025
杜巴库是关键人物
Dubaku is the key

198
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:05,029
我们能通过他找出政府内的腐败官员
to finding out who in the government has been corrupted.

199
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,043
幸运的是  我们手上有他想要的
Luckily,we have something he wants.

200
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,039
马托波
Matobo.

201
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,020
这是找到杜巴库的绝佳机会
He's our best chance to locate Dubaku,

202
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,053
我们能够夺回CIP模块
reacquire the CIP module

203
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:16,044
挖出政府内的贪官污吏
and get to the bottom of the government corruption.

204
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:19,090
一切结束之前  你不能活过来
Until all that happens,you have to stay dead.

205
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,001
是我
Yeah.

206
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,031
找到沃克探员了吗
Did you find agent Walker?

207
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,034
找到了  杰克
Yeah,we got her,Jack.

208
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,038
她没事  你在哪
She's fine. Where are you?

209
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:27,045
北林机场
Northwoods Airfield.

210
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,008
利特法克死了  爱默生受伤
Litvak is dead. Emerson's been wounded.

211
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:31,048
尼科尔斯在途中  你得马上过来
Nichols is en route. I need you to get over here now.

212
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,068
你跟马托波谈过了吗
Have you talked to Matobo?

213
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:34,052
-还没  -必须征得他的同意  杰克
- Not yet. - He needs to agree to this,Jack.

214
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:35,075
没有他  这事儿成不了
We can't do it without him.

215
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:38,032
我会让他同意的  你尽快过来
I'll get him to agree. Just get over here.

216
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:48,067
没事的
It's all right.

217
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:51,050
究竟怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

218
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,014
马托波先生  我不会伤害你们夫妇
Mr. Matobo,I'm not going to hurt you or your wife.

219
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,071
我知道你们很害怕
I know how scared you are

220
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:58,004
我也了解你们的遭遇
and I know what you've been through,

221
00:11:58,004 --> 00:11:59,034
我们是来帮你的
But we are here to help you.

222
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,045
上天啊  你在说什么
What in god's name are you talking about?

223
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:02,035
你绑架了我们
You kidnapped us.

224
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,012
我们必须取得杜巴库的信任
We had to to gain Dubaku's trust.

225
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:07,099
那是我们要找的人  我们正在试图阻止他
That's the man we're after. We're trying to stop him.

226
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:09,032
我要联系我的人
I want to call my people.

227
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:11,082
在我没有解释清楚前不能让你这么做
I can't let you do that,not until you hear me out.

228
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:13,049
我们有个计划可以阻止杜巴库
Sir,we have a plan to stop dubaku,

229
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,016
但是我们需要你的帮助
but we can't do it without your help.

230
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:17,070
我们时间不多了
We don't have much time.

231
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,033
求你了
Please.

232
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,017
帮帮我们
Come with me.

233
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,030
杜巴库先生
Mr. Dubaku.

234
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:29,054
我准备去见面地点
I'm heading to the meeting place.

235
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:30,051
他们正带马托波过来
They're bringing matobo now.

236
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:31,058
和他老婆
And his wife?

237
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,081
他们俩一起
Both of them.

238
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:36,045
你见到马托波后  就知道该做什么了
Once you have Matobo,you know what to do.

239
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:39,008
爱默生的小队已没什么价值了  解决他们
Emerson's team is now a loose end.Tie it off.

240
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,002
你确定么
Are you sure about this?

241
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:44,056
我们可能还要他们效力
We may need their services again.

242
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,023
我宁愿节约我的钻石
I would rather keep my diamonds,

243
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:50,083
阿尔梅达已证明他的立场了
and Almeida has proved to be a liability.

244
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,057
那么
So.

245
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:55,003
白宫有消息么
Any response from the white house?

246
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:56,070
不是我们想要的
Not the one we wanted.

247
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,097
美军还在原地
American forces are still in position.

248
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,007
必须让泰勒总统知道我们抓了马托波
President taylor must know we have Matobo.

249
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:04,028
她没马托波不能攻击桑格拉
She can't attack Sangala without him.

250
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:06,085
政府会崩溃的
The country will collapse.

251
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,005
泰勒可能拖延时间
Taylor may be holding out hope that she can

252
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,065
来想办法拯救马托波
somehow retrieve Matobo.

253
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:12,078
要么她不相信
Or she doesn't believe

254
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,032
我们得给她点威胁
we are willing to carry out our threats.

255
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:19,009
她只会在美国人死了后才能有反应
She will only respond when there are dead Americans.

256
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,093
我见到马托波的时候给你电话
I'll call you when I have Matobo.

257
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:23,096
这些人会听候你的吩咐
These gentlemen are at your command.

258
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:33,001
还有1300架飞机在飞行
There are still 1,300 planes in the air.

259
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,097
那个地点你想攻击
Which region do you want targeted?

260
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:38,098
华盛顿特区
Washington,DC.

261
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:59,030
好的
Yeah.

262
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,049
好的
Yeah.

263
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:03,090
我明白  鲍勃
I understand,Bob.

264
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,088
好的  谢谢
All right,thanks.

265
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:10,055
刚才是国家安全局的鲍勃·康奈尔
That was Bob Cornell at NSA.

266
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,035
他们查到另外一个防火墙缺口
They've detected another firewall breach.

267
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,088
又有一次攻击
There's been another attack?

268
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:16,069
还没  但他们确定CIP装置又一次启动了
Not yet,but they believe the CIP device is being utilized.

269
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:21,016
我们必须认为杜巴库开始另一次攻击
We have to assume Dubaku is initiating another attack.

270
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:23,089
确切的说这次不会只是个警告
It's safe to say this won't be another warning shot.

271
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,043
这次杜巴库肯定要杀人
This time Dubaku's gonna make sure that people die.

272
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:30,070
就我个人而言
I want to speak personally

273
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,047
全国所有紧急反映人员
with all first responders across the country.

274
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,074
他们必须打起精神去面对最惨的情况
They need to know to brace for the worst

275
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,017
我们全力支持他们
and that they have our full support.

276
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:40,018
做好最坏打算之外
Instead of preparing for it,

277
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:41,041
也许我们应该尝试
maybe we should be trying

278
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,031
去得到这次交锋的主动权  总统女士
to preempt this attack,madam president.

279
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,091
杜巴库给我们的
The deadline Dubaku gave us

280
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:49,058
从桑格拉撤军的底线已经过了
for withdrawing our troops from Sangala has passed,

281
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:51,032
但我们可以做点姿态
But if we made some kind of gesture...

282
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:53,022
开始紧急后撤
began an immediate pullback,

283
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:56,002
也许会让杜巴库暂时停止攻击
It might keep Dubaku from pulling the trigger.

284
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:58,073
我们讨论过这个  伊桑  这是不可能的
We've discussed this,Ethan.It's not an option.

285
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:01,033
我不会听命于这个疯子的
I won't be dictated to by this madman.

286
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,010
总统女士  没马托波我们不可以侵入桑格拉
Madam president,we can't invade Sangala without Matobo,

287
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,070
而他获救的可能性很小
And there's very little chance of him being recovered.

288
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,071
我们为什么要拿国民的生命冒险
Why are we risking American lives?

289
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:12,091
我已经说了我的理由了
I've told you my reasons.

290
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:17,091
后撤我们的队伍还不算迟
Withdraw our forces before it's too late.

291
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,085
你让我当顾问是因为你相信我的意见
You asked me to be your advisor because you trust

292
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,029
现在就是我的意见
my opinion. Well,I'm giving it to you now.

293
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,035
我们别无选择
We're out of options.

294
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:27,059
不是的  伊桑
We're not,Ethan.

295
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,053
国家安全局正在搜索
The NSA is attempting to localize

296
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:33,009
可能被攻击的区域
what part of the infrastructure is being targeted,

297
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,093
联邦调查局正在寻找CIP设备
And the FBI is still trying to track down the CIP device.

298
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:43,094
我会随时和这两个部门联系
I'll keep an open channel with both agencies.

299
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:45,091
随时向你报告
I'll keep you apprised.

300
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,041
好的
Good.

301
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,082
让我看看
Let me see it.

302
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:02,002
让我看看
Let me see it!

303
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:07,050
戴维  这不是为了钻石
This wasn't about the diamonds,David.

304
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,056
我觉得你太过分了
You crossed a line I wasn't willing to cross.

305
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,080
对不起
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,044
你想让我原谅
You're looking for forgiveness...

307
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:20,094
去死吧
go to hell.

308
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,055
你
You...

309
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:27,055
内疚去吧
live with it.

310
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:33,086
你想让我们冒生命危险
You're asking us to risk our lives

311
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:36,052
去杜巴库那里
to be delivered into Dubaku's hands,based on nothing

312
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:37,069
无凭无据  只凭你口头说说
but what you have told us.

313
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:39,026
我说的都是事实
Everything I have told you is the truth.

314
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,083
杜巴库在这里  我们要找出他
Dubaku is in this country,and we need to find him.

315
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,030
你是我们唯一的赌注
You have as much at stake as we do.

316
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,080
他是你我两国共同的敌人
He's attacked both our countries.

317
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,030
听他的  乌勒
Listen to him,Ule.

318
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,021
你自己告诉我  泰勒总统
You told me yourself president Taylor

319
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:52,037
在这些攻击停止前
will not commit forces to Sangala

320
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:54,031
不会派兵去桑格拉
until these attacks are stopped.

321
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:56,028
但我们怎么可以相信这个人
But how can we trust this man?

322
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:59,018
因为他没有撒谎的理由
Because he has no reason to lie.

323
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:10,029
我会按你说的做  但是只能我一个人去
I will do what you ask,but I will go alone.

324
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,089
杜巴库要的是你和你夫人
Dubaku wants you and your wife.

325
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,033
-说好的  -不行
-That's the deal. -No.

326
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,033
我不会把我老婆交到那个怪物的手上
I will not put my wife in the hands of that monster.

327
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:17,087
我跟你说实话  先生
I will be honest with you,sir.

328
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:19,033
他想要你妻子做交换条件
He wants your wife as leverage.

329
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,084
你们无论谁留下  他都会取消交易
If I don't deliver both of you,he will back out.

330
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,090
交换条件
Leverage.

331
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,094
你是说他想通过折磨她
You mean he wants to torture her

332
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:26,054
好让我告诉他我知道有哪些人在
to make me tell him what I know about the resistance

333
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:28,031
-桑加拉  -是的  先生
-in Sangala? -Yes,sir.

334
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:29,088
我们不会让他得逞
And we won't let that happen.

335
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,005
我们会跟在你后面
We'll be following you.

336
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:32,058
但你还是不能向我保证
Still,you can't promise me

337
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:34,085
她不受到伤害  你能吗
that she won't be harmed,can you?

338
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,088
你能吗
Can you?

339
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,029
我不会这么做的
I won't do it.

340
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,083
我能跟我丈夫单独谈谈吗
May I speak with my husband?

341
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,003
当然  夫人
Of course,ma'am.

342
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:52,043
我想这么做  乌勒
I want to do this,Ule.

343
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,077
-什么  -我为自己打开来
-What? -I am ashamed

344
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:57,004
避难所的门而感到丢脸
that I opened the door to the safe room.

345
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:59,051
我想做对我们国家有益的事
I want to do what is right for our country.

346
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:01,008
不是那样的
Absolutely not.

347
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:03,041
你阻止不了我  乌勒
You can't stop me,Ule.

348
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,078
桑加拉也是我的祖国
Sangala is my country,too.

349
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:10,079
我在你身边支持了你22年
I have been by your side for 22 years.

350
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,072
我不会就这么放弃的
I am not going to leave it now.

351
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:32,041
鲍尔先生  我和太太一起去
Mr. Bauer.We will do this together.

352
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:34,054
谢谢
Thank you.

353
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:37,011
你们都非常勇敢
You are both very brave.

354
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:38,025
我们现在得马上离开
We'll need to go soon.

355
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:39,088
请稍等我一下
Excuse me for one moment.

356

马托波夫妇同意跟我们合作了

359
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:02,050
托尼

00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:13,008
我们把尸体抬走吧
Let's get the bodies out of sight.

361
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,093
我们已经锁定了联邦航空局

362
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,086
开始改变路线

366
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:49,092
这是国家安全局最新的报告

367
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:52,095
-我可以为简单汇报一下  -说吧

368
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:56,046
他们还没能找出防火墙的漏洞
They've had no luck In localizing the firewall breach.

369
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:58,093
杜巴库可以袭击任何地方
Dubaku's attack could hit anywhere.

370
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:01,006
联邦调查局怎么样
What about the FBI?

371
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:04,097
他们已经派出了所有能派的探员
They've dedicated every available agent

372
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:06,033
去搜寻马托波

373
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,027
他们也没有进展
They're no closer to finding him.

374
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:10,057
不好意思
Uh,excuse me.

375
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:15,004
我们走投无路了  总统女士
We're at a dead end,madam president.

376
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,068
你需要下令撤退

377
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:18,081
而且必须现在马上

379
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:22,015

-总统女士  -怎么了  蒂姆

382
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,092
我刚刚转接到一个电话
I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.

383

是杜巴库上校打来的

他要求跟您对话

385
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,096
我接
I'll take it.

386
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:44,084

00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:47,041
总统女士  我很失望
Madam president... I'm disappointed

388
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,014
你没能认真的按照我的要求做
that you have not taken my demands seriously.

389
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:53,038
你的部队还在逼近我的国家
Your forces are still in position near my country.

390
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,075
杜巴库上校  我向你保证

391
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:58,069
我们刚刚对你的要求进行了严肃的讨论
very serious discussions regarding your demands.

392
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:01,012
现在没时间讨论了
The time for discussions is over.

393
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,049
你们撤军的
The deadline for your forces

394
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,036
时限已经过了
to begin their withdrawal has passed.

395
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:08,023
到窗户那去
Go to the window.

396
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:10,097
看看西南方  总统女士
Look to the southwest,madam president.

397
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:12,060
什么
What?

398
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,054
看看你都干了什么
See what you have done.

399
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,014
杜巴库上校  你胆敢威胁到
Colonel dubaku,if you're endangering

400
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,071
一个美国人的生命的话

401
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:19,091
我的天啊
Oh,my god.

00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,058
去吧  总统女士
Go,madam president.

403
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:34,032
你个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

404
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:36,099
一小时内照我说的做
Comply with my demands within the hour,

405
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:40,066
否则一万多美国人就会死
Or 10,000 more americans will die.

406
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,003
所有内阁还都在吗
Is the cabinet still assembled?

407
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,060
是的  总统女士

408
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:48,049
出事的是芝加哥131航班

他们和一架乘载21人的通勤
They collided with a small commuter jet

411
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:54,027
喷气式飞机相撞

412
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:55,067
很有可能
There's also a high probability

413
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,030
地面也有人员伤亡

飞机坠毁在艾治区附近的

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,036
可能在这架航班上  我们正在等待进一步确认
may have been on 131. we're waiting for confirmation.

420
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:18,019
还有多少架飞机在飞
How many planes are still in the air?

421
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:20,026
超过1300架
Over 1,300.

422
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:22,060
总统女士
Madam president,

423
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,060
这是危及美国生命的大灾难
This is a catastrophic loss of american lives,

424
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,027
而且情况只会更糟
and it's only going to get worse.

425
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:27,087
我们必须在下一个限期之前撤军
We have to withdraw our forces before the next deadline.

426
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:30,034
我不得不同意  总统阁下
I'm forced to agree,madam president.

427
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:39,021
继续说  蒂姆  我想知道你的看法
Go ahead,Tim. I want to hear what you think.

428
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:43,038
我们没有准备好应对
We're simply not prepared to contend with the scope

429
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,025
这些恐怖分子所能造成的大面积破坏
of damage these people can inflict.

430
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:46,089
刚才的灾难
The tragedy we've just witnessed

431
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:48,012
比起他们对电网
is nothing compared

432
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:51,002
或核设施的攻击而造成的破坏来说
to what could happen if they begin targeting

433
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:53,066
简直就是小儿科了
power grids,nuclear facilities.

434
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,046
我们应该考虑是否值得用成千上万美国民众的
We're talking deaths in the hundreds of thousands.

435
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:58,010
生命去支持那样的一个政策
all in support of a policy

436
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,080
而且这个政策的成功依赖于马托波
That cannot possibly succeed without Matobo.

437
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,070
他是唯一一个可以稳定桑加拉局势的人
He's the only man who can stabilize Sangala.

438
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,074
没有他的协助
Without him,

439
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:05,087
整个计划就不具备可行性
The entire operation is pointless.

440
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:18,028
我们仍然有一丝希望
There's still a chance

441
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:20,089
救回马托波总理
that prime minister Matobo will be recovered.

442
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:24,029
只要尚存一丝希望  我就绝不放弃
And while that chance exists,I'm not giving in.

443
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,099
史密斯上将  你的部队
Admiral Amith,your strike force

444
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,056
原地不动  继续保持战前准备状态
will remain in position and at full battle readiness.

445
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:30,096
明白  总统阁下
Yes,madam president.

446
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:31,096
总统阁下  你正在批准
Madam president,you're guaranteeing

447
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,040
对我们国家的另一次袭击
another attack on our country.

448
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,010
我们不会容忍勒索  乔  我们更不会被当成人质为他们利用
We will not be blackmailed,Joe,and we will not be held

449
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,014
这个国家从来不和恐怖分子谈判
hostage.This country does not negotiate with terrorists.

450
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:41,024
把这些话和那些死者家属说吧
Tell that to the families of the dead!

451
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:44,024
你有没有想过如果公众得知
Do you have any idea what the public reaction will be

452
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,015
这些恐怖袭击是由于你鲁莽的外交政策造成的
when word gets out that these are acts of terrorism?

453
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,085
他们会有什么样的反应
Brought about by your reckless foreign policy?

454
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,002
我敢保证你会受到弹劾的
I can guarantee there will be a call for your impeachment...

455
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,015
别说了  乔
That's enough,Joe.

456
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:52,049
我不能让这样的事情发生
I will not stand by and let this happen.

457
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:54,062
那你可以辞职了  乔
Then you can turn in your resignation,joe,

458
00:24:54,062 --> 00:24:57,009
我是不会改变我的想法的
because I'm not changing my mind.

459
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:01,029
现在  要么坐下要么走人
Now sit down or leave.

460
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:15,024
对不起  总统阁下
I'm sorry,madam president.

461
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:18,041
你们好好想想你们正在做的事情
You people think about what you're doing here...

462
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,045
想想你们要为此付出多大的代价
about the precious you're willing to pay.

463
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:44,004
先生们
Gentlemen,

464
00:25:44,004 --> 00:25:51,008
女士们  我明白你们当中很多人
Ladies I know that there are many of you here

465
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,094
同意国务卿史蒂文的看法
who agree with secretary Stevens.

466
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:58,008
如果我不能让你的疑惑减少
If I can't alleviate your doubts,

467
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:02,045
我至少可以让你明白我这么做的理由
I can at least help you to understand my reasonings.

468
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:08,053
当我宣誓就职的时候  我向我自己
When I took the oath of office,I swore to myself,

469
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:12,057
更向全体美国人民发誓  这个国家将继续
and to the american people,that this country would

470
00:26:12,057 --> 00:26:15,053
作为这个世界的正义力量
continue to be a force for good in this world.

471
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:19,074
我们建国是基于我们的理想
We're a nation founded on ideals,

472
00:26:19,074 --> 00:26:24,071
这些理想在今天正受到挑战
and those ideals are being challenged today.

473
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:30,088
我们对此的反应不但会影响我们这届政府
Now how we respond will not only define this

474
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,089
更会影响一代美国人民
administration,but an entire generation.

475
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:38,056
甚至包括桑加拉人民
And not just americans,but Sangalans,and anyone

476
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:43,090
还有那些希望从我们身上得到力量和指引的人们
else who looks to us for guidance and strength.

477
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,060
我不会令他们失望
I won't fail them...

478
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,024
你们也不会
and neither will you.

479
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:03,005
前面的道路很艰难
We're in for some tough times ahead.

480
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:06,015
让我们一起努力
Let's make sure we're ready.

481
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:16,056
谢谢大家
Thank you,everyone.

482
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,083
杰克
Hey,Jack.

483
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:17,006
他们在那儿  我要你放个追踪器在
They're over there. I want you to put a wire

484
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:19,004
马托波先生身上  快
on Mr. Matobo as fast as you can. Go.

485
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:26,084
你没事吧
You okay?

486
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:29,041
你说呢  杰克
What do you think,Jack?

487
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,055
你朝我开枪还把我活埋了
You shot me and buried me alive.

488
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:34,021
如果我们不那么做  你就会死在爱默生的手下了
If we hadn't,Emerson would have killed you.

489
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:36,052
很抱歉你必须继续隐藏起来
I'm sorry we had to keep you in the dark,

490
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:38,095
-我们别无选择  -不  你们有
- But we didn't have a choice.  - Yes,you did.

491
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:40,052
你可以选择相信我
You could have trusted me.

492
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:43,022
在联调局总部的时候如果我告诉你这一切
If I had told you everything back at the FBI,

493
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:45,087
你会信吗
Would you have believed me?

494
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,068
请坐  先生
Have a seat,please,sir.

495
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:16,029
那是什么
What's that?

496
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,096
这是个追踪器
It's a transmitter.

497
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:20,040
我会把它粘在你的一颗牙上
I'll be affixing it to one of your teeth.

498
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:24,093
这样我们就可以随时知道你的方位
We'll know exactly where you are at all times.

499
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:26,000
你就不再是孤身奋斗了
You won't be alone.

500
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:27,033
你是联调局的人吗
Are you with the FBI?

501
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:29,064
不  我只是一个家庭主妇
No,I'm a stay-at-home Mom.

502
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:32,097
张开你的嘴  谢谢
Open your mouth,please.

503
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:34,034
张大点
Wider.

504
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:35,084
谢谢
Good.

505
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:37,028
克罗伊进入了联邦调查局的服务器
Chloe accessed the FBI server.

506
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:39,038
杜马库在首都外围使两架
Dubaku brought down two planes

507
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,098
飞机坠毁了
just outside the capital.

508
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:44,068
超过270人因此丧命
Over 270 people were killed.

509
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:45,095
他威胁要杀死1万人
He's threatened to kill 10,000 more.

510
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:47,052
我们有不到一个小时的时间去阻止他
We have less than an hour to stop it.

511
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:48,062
尼科尔斯什么时候到
How long before Nichols gets here?

512
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,066
10分钟内
Ten minutes.

513
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:52,057
-你的耳机  -多谢
- Here's your com.  - Thanks.

514
00:30:01,078 --> 00:30:03,064
你还好吧
You all right?

515
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:06,004
嗯  就是有点头晕
Yeah,just a little dizzy.

516
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,014
你找个座位坐下吧
You should take a seat.

517
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,021
我还好
I'm fine.

518
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:11,055
过来  坐下吧
Hey,come on. Take a seat.

519
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:16,082
这些都是真的吗
So it's really true?

520
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,002
是
Yeah.

521
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:21,025
我把我的生命都献给了调查局
I've devoted my life to the bureau

522
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:23,099
你却让我相信它已经腐败了
And you just expect me to believe that it's corrupted--

523
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,033
甚至整个政府都腐败了
that the entire government's been corrupted?

524
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:26,039
不是所有的人
Not all of them.

525
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,073
但直到我们查明之前
But until we find out who,

526
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:29,003
我们谁也不能相信
we can't trust anyone.

527
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:31,023
你认为你们四个人就可以搞得定吗
And the four of you really think you can stop this?

528
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:35,001
没有别的选择  道理就这么简单
We have to. It's as simple as that.

529
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:42,014
伊桑
Ethan...

530
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:43,075
借一步说话
Can we...?

531
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:49,035
总统完全是一意孤行
The president is completely alone on this,

532
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:50,095
如此下去  将有无数美国人丧生
And she's going to get a lot of Americans killed.

533
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:53,032
你得想办法说服她
You've got to find a way to talk some sense into her.

534
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,056
我们的观点一致  蒂姆
We're both on the same side here,Tim.

535
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,039
我需要你的帮助
And I'm going to need your help

536
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,033
才能改变她的想法
If we're going to change her mind.

537
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:01,009
你认为该怎么做
How do you propose we do that?

538
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,010
有一个人能说服她
There is someone she'll listen to.

539
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:07,088
我们也许能说服他帮我们
Maybe we can convince him to help us.

540
00:31:58,063 --> 00:31:59,069
什么事
Go ahead.

541
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,099
她刚下车  正在上楼
I just dropped her off. She's on her way up.

542
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,029
好  在车里留意动静
Okay,stay in the car and keep watch.

543
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,030
结束后我打给你
I'll call you when it's done.

544
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:03,036
泰勒先生  你怎么进来的
Mr.Taylor,how did you get in here?

545
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:09,072
你派来的探员送我过来
Um... the agent you sent just brought me by to get

546
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:11,063
拿一些东西
a few of my things for...

547
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:17,057
泰勒先生  你没事吧
Mr.Taylor,are you all right?

548
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:25,075
泰勒先生  你还好吗
Mr.Taylor,are you okay?

549
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:30,081
泰勒先生  请告诉我你怎么了
Mr.Taylor,unless you tell me what's wrong,

550
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:34,052
否则我不知道
I don't know what...

551
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:41,013
救我  求你
Help me. Please.

552
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:06,061
卡宁先生
Yes,Mr. Kanin.

553
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:09,038
盖奇探员  我找亨利·泰勒
Agent Gedge,I'm looking for Henry Taylor.

554
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,012
他的手机无人接听  你在他身边吗
He's not answering his phone.Is he with you?
