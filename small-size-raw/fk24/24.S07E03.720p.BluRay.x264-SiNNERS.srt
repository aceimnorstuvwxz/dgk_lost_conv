《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:15,056
这究竟是怎么一回事
What the hell is this?!

5
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,051
所有监视东部区域的屏幕都被锁定了
All our screens for the eastern quadrant are locked.

6
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:19,047
我已经把你的空管权弄到手了
I took out your control units.

7
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,050
我想让你看看我们的能力
I want you to see what we can do.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,033
让他们准备改变航线
Get ready to make the course change

9
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:26,090
GSA117  这里是东北三号
Gsa 117, this is northeast three control.

10
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:28,026
请讲  航管局
Go ahead, air traffic control.

11
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,038
我们给你分配了一条新的降落跑道
We have a new runway assignment for you.

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,087
该死  这架飞机从右四跑道降落
Sid, there's another plane landing on four-right.

13
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:34,002
它正好穿过左31跑道
It crosses three-one-left.

14
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,060
GSA 117  请拉升
Gsa 117, pull up.

15
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:37,065
又四跑道  马上拉升
Four-right, pull up.

16
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:41,092
刚才不过是一个警告
That was just a warning shot.

17
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:43,014
下一次
Whatever we do next

18
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:44,032
我们会来真格的
It'll be the real thing.

19
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,001
把仪器准备好
Get the module ready.

20
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:48,048
按要求设计的
As promised.

21
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,089
朱玛上校会对此很满意的
General juma will be pleased.

22
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:53,066
现在是时候了
Perhaps now would be a good time

23
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,056
和泰勒总统交涉
to make your demands known to president taylor.

24
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:56,097
准备一下
Make the preparations.

25
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,065
现在他们将付出巨大的代价
Your government is about to pay a very steep price for...

26
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:02,013
涉足我们的私事
...interfering in our affairs.

27
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,066
他们认为我儿子是自杀
They assumed my son killed himself

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,094
因此对他的案子草草了之
They didn't look deeply enough into anything.

29
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:09,043
先生  当局已经对你儿子女友进行询问了
The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.

30
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:11,055
告诉我事实  否则你别想走
You're not going anywhere till I get the truth.

31
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:14,015
你知道杀害我儿子的凶手
You know who murdered my son.

32
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:15,069
他是自杀的
He killed himself

33
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,041
我会找出事情真相的
I'm gonna find what you are hiding.

34
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:20,027
到那时谁也救不了你
When I do, God helf you.

35
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:22,030
没错  他不是我们的人
You're right. he's not one of ours.

36
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,063
跟踪他  看看能否带我们找到托尼·阿尔梅达
We'll follow him, see if he leads us back to almeida-- dornan.

37
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:26,059
不  这样做不对
No, that's not the right move.

38
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,028
这事不能让其它人知道
You can't bring anyone else into this,

39
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:30,057
你究竟在干什么
What the hell's going on?

40
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:31,097
我们在查别的线索
We're following up on a lead.

41
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:34,005
一有发现  我第一时间向你汇报
And I will fill you in if and when we find something.

42
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,099
我不喜欢这样
I do not like this.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,035
我厌倦了欺骗我的上司
I just flat out lied to my boss.

44
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:39,002
我告诉你帮你找到托尼·阿尔梅达
I told you I'd help you find Tony Almeida.

45
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:40,090
但你要让我按我的方法来做
But you're going to have to let me do it my way.

46
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:44,087
托尼  不许动
Tony, stop.

47
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:53,005
仪器不见了
Device is gone.

48
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,073
定位器记录已经被删除了
The locator files have been deleted.

49
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:56,060
在哪里
Where is it?!

50
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:03,064
你到底是怎么了
What the hell happened to you?

51
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:10,013
以下事件发生于上午十点至十一点

52
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:13,015
阿尔梅达现在在哪里
Where is almeida now?

53
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,079
他正在押送往FBI总部的途中
He is in transit to FBI headquarters

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,067
他会在那里接受审讯
He'll be formally interrogated there.

55
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:19,091
我搞不懂  阿尔梅达主导了这次事件
I don't understand. Almeida was orchestrating this attack.

56
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:22,073
如果他没有CIP装置  那它在谁的手里
If he doesn't have the CIP device, who does?

57
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:24,091
FBI得知阿尔梅达把芯片交给了别人
The FBI has learned that Almeida haned off the device

58
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:27,051
我们目前还不知道他是谁
to someone else,we don't know who.

59
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:30,004
我可以回答这个问题  总统阁下
I may have answer to that question, madam president.

60
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,028
请说
I'm listening.

61
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:33,065
阿尔梅达在替朱玛政府干活
He's working with the Juma regime.

62
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,054
大约5分钟之前
Approximately 5 minutes ago,

63
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,078
我们在内部网络上收到了这份声讯
an audio message was routed to the State Department's subnet.

64
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,095
杜巴库上校搞的鬼
It's from Colonel Dubaku

65
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:41,032
他是朱玛的忠实部下
He's Juma's right-hand man.

66
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,093
桑加拉出名的屠夫
He's known as the butcher in Sangala.

67
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,089
死在他手下了有30万人
Over three hundred thousand people were murdered.

68
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,090
我知道这个家伙
I know who he is.

69
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,034
这条声讯的内容是什么
What did the message say?

70
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,082
你自己听吧
You should hear it yourself.

71
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,051
泰勒总统
President Taylor

72
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:57,015
我是杜巴库
This is Colonel Ike Dubaku.

73
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,068
我想你们一定明白
As you have no doubt confirmed,

74
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,020
肯尼迪机场发生的不是意外事件
the near-collison at JFK international was no accident

75
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:07,050
芯片在我们的手中
We have the CIP device.

76
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:13,083
我们随时可以杀死成千上万美国人
We have the capability to kill tens of thousansds of Americans.

77
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:16,083
我们也正准备这么做
And we are prepared to do so.

78
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:19,012
我要求你方立刻并彻底得
We demand the complete and immediate withdrawal

79
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:21,041
撤走海军打击力量
of the US naval strike force

80
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:26,059
在明早此时之前撤出23子午线
to a position west of 23rd meridian by this time tommorrow.

81
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:30,066
为了保证撤离行动按时进行
In order to meet this timeline

82
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:34,048
我们要求使用你们的卫星
We require a satellite confirmation within three hours.

83
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,078
来证明航母的完全撤离
that the Carrier Air Wing is in full retreat.

84
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:44,002
不要让你士兵做无谓的牺牲了
Don't sacrifice your fellow countryman.

85
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:46,032
总统阁下
Madam president

86
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:51,049
请允许桑加拉人民决定自己的命运吧
Allow the people of Sangala to determine their own destiny.

87
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:55,023
撤离你的军队
Stand your forces down.

88
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,038
声音89%吻合
Voice prints an 89% match.

89
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,055
是杜巴库  毫无疑问
It's Dubaku. There's little doubt.

90
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:02,005
您先前的猜测是正确的  总统阁下
Looks like your suspicion were correct, madam president.

91
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,081
这两件事情确实有关联
This is about Africa.

92
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:08,012
我的天  杜巴库早就为这场战争在做准备了
My god. Dubaku should have been tried for war crimes years ago.

93
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,019
现在他给我们最后通牒
Now he's giving us ultimatums.

94
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,006
我们绝不能让他以美国为要挟
We can not let this monster hold our country hostage.

95
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,033
我们的飞机情况如何
Where do we stand on the planes?

96
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:17,014
还有2500多架飞机未降落
They're still 2500 planes in the air

97
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,028
我们必须尽快改进我们的系统
We have got to shore up the firewall

98
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,061
这样CIP芯片就没有威胁了
so that the CIP device will be rendered useless.

99
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:24,027
我认为我们可以在6天内重设系统
We now think we can re-engineer the code in six days.

100
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:27,003
6天  我们连6小时都没有
Six days? We don't have the luxury of six hours!

101
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,085
对不起  总统阁下  这么短的时间
I'm sorry, madam president. But their is no way

102
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:31,029
我们无法重设系统
we can rebuild the firewall in that timeframe.

103
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,052
你去制定一个应对攻击的保密计划
I want you to instigate a series of restricted allerts.

104
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,066
通话仅限于机长
Keep it to the first responders only.

105
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,044
我希望我们能够准备好对付可能的攻击
I want people to be ready in case we are attacked again

106
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,041
但我不想造成恐慌
but we don't wanna start panic

107
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:47,019
好的  总统阁下
Yes, madam president

108
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:52,006
先生们  阿尔梅达现在是我们唯一的线索
And gentlemen, Almeida is our only lead.

109
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,093
告知FBI非洲的要求
Make sure the FBI is aware of the demands

110
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,052
让他们从非洲方面对阿尔梅达下手
and they need to work Almeida from the Africa side

111
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,011
告诉他们  我们的时间不多了
And they need to know we don't have a lot of time.

112
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,080
好的  总统阁下
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,052
快点
Come on

114
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:32,024
小心头
Put your head down

115
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,038
带他去审讯
Get him ready for questioning.

116
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,003
我需要你的解释
I want an explanation.

117
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:57,022
你们在没有后援和上级同意的情况下去了那艘船上
You went after that shooter without backup or authorization,

118
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,025
甚至拒绝告诉我这么做的原因
And then refused to tell me why.

119
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,043
我现在想知道这是为什么
Now i want to know

120
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:02,021
我们不知道谁会听得到我们的通话
We didn't know who might be listening

121
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:05,004
我们中间有内鬼
Someone in this office is helping Almeida

122
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:08,049
FBI被渗透了  有内奸
The FBI has been compromised, larry. there's a leak

123
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:11,023
你有什么根据  你干嘛
Based on what? Excuse me!

124
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:12,027
这是私人谈话
This is private

125
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:15,025
托尼在我们到达之前就得到了这个情报
Tony knew that we were going to Schector's office before we even got there

126
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,046
所以他才有时间布置狙击手
That's how he managed a sniper in position

127
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,005
内鬼一定是你的人  
The tip had to come from your office,

128
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:22,006
不管他是谁  把他给找出来  让他滚蛋
 whoever it was helped sheclter's assassinator got out of the building

129
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,039
他说得对  这就是为什么我们先前不能告诉你
He is right lerry, that's why we couldn't tell you

130
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:27,026
我们已经把狙击手包围了  每个出口都有我们的人
You've got a full perimeter, right?Covered every exit?

131
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:29,049
但他还是跑掉了
How else do you think he got out of there?

132
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,029
这事看起来很棘手  你知道内鬼是谁吗
All right, assuming this is true, you got any idea who it could be?

133
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,030
我们还不清楚   但他知道我们的行动
No, we didn't see him, but we knew that it went down

134
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,044
一定是局里的人
Could be anyone in the bureau

135
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:41,095
托尼  你必须管好你的人
You need tighten your circle around tony

136
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:45,076
你不能让他再把情报泄露出去了
You can't get any information that he gives you get back to the people

137
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,038
否则的话你永远找不到那块芯片
Other wise you will never get the CIP device

138
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:57,049
好吧 我会把安全等级调升到四
All right, I'll limit access the level 4 clearance above

139
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,084
查一下纪录  看看有没有可能找出内鬼
Have Janis run the security protocols see if she can track down the leak

140
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,064
我是moss
This's moss

141
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:05,023
白宫找你
Sir I have a white house call for you

142
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,017
-我去办公室接  -好的
-Yeah, I'll take it in my office -Yes

143
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:09,000
-再见
-Yea

144
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,097
是白宫
It's the white house

145
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:19,012
从现在开始  你不得再私自行动
From now on, keep me in the loop

146
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,044
特别是你要向我通报他的一切行动
And he doesn't do a damn thing without telling me

147
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,076
除了告诉他  我们别无选择
We had to tell him, We had no choice

148
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:32,022
他值得信任吗
You trust him?

149
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:35,004
当然  我最相信他了
No question, there is no one I trust more

150
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:39,024
他们会把托尼关在哪
Where they gonna hold tony?

151
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:45,046
我等下要把你的衣服提上去
Well, I'm gonna have to lift up your shirt

152
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:00,095
有什么不舒服的地方吗
Is that comfortable for you?

153
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,099
看起来你没事
I'll take that as a Yes

154
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,096
-怎么样了 -一切都准备好了
-Is he hooked up?-Yeah, we are ready to go

155
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:21,060
  我来主持审讯  你有别的任务
Janis, I'll run this session, I want you to handle something else

156
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,007
什么任务
What else?

157
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:25,008
把泄密的人给找出来
Plugging a security leak

158
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:27,081
什么
What?

159
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,072
我们认为这里有人在帮助阿尔梅达
We think someone in this office has been helping Almeida

160
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,096
为此安全等级升到了四级 
We've kicked this up to level four clearance.I want

161
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,091
你去看一下所有的通讯和情报纪录
you to vet all communication and information flow.

162
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:38,044
特别是和阿尔梅达有关的数据
Red-tag every data point that has to do with almeida.

163
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:40,043
好的  你知道那个人可能是谁吗
Okay, do we have any idea who it is?

164
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:43,010
不知道  我们希望你能够找出那个家伙来
No, we don't. I'm hoping that you can help us find out

165
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,002
好的
Okay

166
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:49,056
血压计有0.2的测量误差 
There's a point-two deviation on the blood pressure monitor,

167
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,091
 你得注意调整一下
you are gonna have to compensate for that

168
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,044
谢谢你  
Thanks,Janis

169
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:11,004
杰克  我很遗憾他是你的朋友
Sorry about your friend Jack.

170
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:15,014
我知道你希望他从未做过此事
I know you were hoping he wasn't capable of doing something like this.

171
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:18,057
是的
Yea

172
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:37,085
这究竟是怎么一回事  为什么启用四级安全防范
Hey, what's going on, why are we in the level 4 lockdown?

173
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:39,025
别管它  做好你的工作就行
Don't worry about that, just do your job

174
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,028
我的安全权限无法获得资料 
How am I supposed to do my job when

175
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,037
 怎么进行工作
i can't get through half the server nodes in the building

176
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,099
你的任务是收集整理阿尔梅达留下的资料
You're sifting through the evidence gathered at almeida's arrest site

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,072
这不需要安全等级四的权限
That doesn't not require level 4 clearings

178
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:50,027
把你需要的东西准备好  继续工作吧
Get everything you need to do your work, PLEASE

179
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:02,025
好  我明白
Oui, je comprends

180
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,095
确定阿尔梅达在联调局那里
It's confirmed, the FBI has Almeida.

181
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,082
继续行动  这件事我们无能为力
We should move on, there's nothing we can do.

182
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:20,013
局内有我们的人  也许能把他救出来
We have assets inside the bureau, we use them, perhaps will get him out.

183
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,047
不行  太冒险
No, it's too risky.

184
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:22,097
那样做会破坏整个计划
We'd be jeopardizing the entire mission.

185
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:24,039
阿尔梅达没那么重要
Almeida is just not that important.

186
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,058
那下一项行动怎么办
What about the next operation?

187
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,083
托尼已经准备妥当  可以开始了
Tony is prepped, he's ready to go.

188
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,053
只能找别人了
We'll just gonna have to find someone else.

189
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,079
我知道你和托尼是朋友
I realized you and Tony are friends.

190
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,055
我也不想让他羊入虎口
I don't like throwing him to the wolves anymore than you do.

191
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:35,079
他也知道可能会有这个结果
But he knew what he was getting into.

192
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:39,019
我刚和朱玛通过电话
I just spoke with Juma

193
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,064
美军仍在我国附近驻扎
The American troops are still in position near our country.

194
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:43,025
请转告朱玛耐心些
Tell Juma to be patient,

195
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:45,096
泰勒总统刚收到你的要求
President Taylor just received your demands.

196
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:49,059
那或许我们该给他们更有力的回应
Then perhaps this time for a more forceful demonstration.

197
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,037
如果有那个必要  我们会做好准备
If it comes to that, we will be ready.

198
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:54,074
我们暂时要给白宫一些考虑的时间
For now, let's give the white house a little more time to respond.

199
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,056
暂时
For now.

200
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,059
沃克探员
Agent Walker.

201
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,077
阿尔梅达在为朱玛卖命
Almeida is working for the Juma reign.

202
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,023
什么意思
What are you talking about?

203
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:23,062
总统刚从埃克·杜巴库上校那里
The president just received a set of demands.

204
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:25,013
那里收到了一系列要求
They're from Colonel Ike Dubaku.

205
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:26,063
杜巴库
Dubaku?

206
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:29,024
看来他和阿尔梅达做了交易来制作CIP模块
Looks like he contracted Almeida to build the CIP module.

207
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:32,004
不  他会以此来要挟白宫
No, he's gonna blackmail the white house.

208
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:34,030
怎么要挟
How?

209
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,089
什么
Excuse me?

210
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,041
他要怎样要挟白宫
How is he gonna blackmail the white house?

211
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:42,070
坚持让我们从桑甘拉沿岸撤军
By insisting we stand down the invasion force of the coast Sangala.

212
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,076
假使总统不满足他的要求
If the president doesn't comply with his demands,

213
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:48,036
杜巴库就会开始杀害美国人
Dubaku is gonna start killing americans.

214
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,086
我可以给你拿到CIP装置
I can get you the CIP device.

215
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,055
让我和他谈谈
Just let me talk to him.

216
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:58,013
我认识他  知道他的想法
I know him, I might know how he thinks.

217
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,047
我们是旧相识  我会利用这点来对付他
We have a history, I can use it to agaist him.

218
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,040
他已经让我们走到这步  拉里
He's got us this far, Larry.

219
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,029
他说的有道理
It makes sense.

220
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:09,072
你们的时间所剩无几
You're running out of time.

221
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,067
你们没有更好的选择
You don't have a better option.

222
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:41,005
让我们单独在一起
Give us the room.

223
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,030
我看你死在我的怀里
I watched you die in my arms.

224
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:56,021
能告诉我你为何还活着吗
You wanna explain to me why you're still alive?

225
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:03,032
我猜也是
Didn't think so.

226
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:05,080
不如让我告诉你我知道些什么
Why don't I tell you what I know.

227
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:09,049
我知道你在为朱玛政权卖命
I know that you're working for Juma regime.

228
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:11,045
白宫刚收到他们的要求
The white house just got their demands.

229
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:14,056
你也一定知道我绝不会让他得逞
And you have to know that I will never let that happen.

230
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,007
你省省吧
Why don't you save yourself some time.

231
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,054
和皮肉之苦  告诉我CIP装置是什么
and some pain and tell me what CIP device is.

232
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,062
这我不能说  杰克
I can't tell you that, Jack.

233
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:34,056
托尼  你不仅将被控国内恐怖主义
Tony, you're not just facing charges of domestic terrorism,

234
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:36,064
还会因帮助及唆使种族灭绝
you were gonna face international charges

235
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,043
而受到国际指控
for aiding and abetting a genocide,

236
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,091
他们会判你死刑
They will give you the death penalty.

237
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:43,053
拜托  配合我一下
Come on, just work with me on this.

238
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,086
我可以帮你谈条件  甚至让你豁免
I can help you cut a deal, I can maybe even get you an immunity.

239
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,084
你在浪费唇舌
You're wasting your breath, Jack.

240
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,049
换做我  就会告诉总统撤军
If I were you, I would tell the president to withdraw those troops.

241
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,050
因为杜巴库心狠手辣
Because Dubaku is serious.

242
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:55,051
除非满足他的要求
He's ready to take thousands of american lives

243
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,098
否则几千名美国人就会丧生
unless his demands are met.

244
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:58,077
你到底为什么这么做
Why the hell are you doing this?

245
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:03,025
朱玛想要CIP模块  他想花钱买
Juma wanted the CIP module and he was brewing to pay for it.

246
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,052
我不信
I don't believe you.

247
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:12,037
不是吧  杰克
Oh, come on, Jack.

248
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:14,038
别表现的那么惊讶
Don't act so surprised.

249
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,047
我现在只为钱卖命
Money is the only reason I have left doing anything.

250
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,087
由政府来买单
The government took care of that.

251
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:22,044
不是政府害死了米歇尔
The government did not kill Michelle.

252
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:24,013
是查尔斯·洛根
Charles Logan did.

253
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:26,067
查尔斯·洛根不过是环境的产物
Charles Logan is the product of his enviroment.

254
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:29,071
是政府让他一步步走向泥潭
The government poisons everything in his path.

255
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,038
你比我更清楚这点  杰克
But you know that better than me, Jack.

256
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:34,022
他们把你害成了什么样
Look what they did to you.

257
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:36,054
可恶  托尼  咱们现在谈论的人不是我
Damn it, Tony, we're not talking about me.

258
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,027
不是吗
Oh, we're not?

259
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:42,032
你在问我为何这样做
You're asking me why I'm doing this.

260
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:44,023
我可以问你同样的问题
I could ask you the same question.

261
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,076
正是你为之卖命的这些人
Here you are, working for the same people

262
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:47,027
当初想把你送进监狱
who wanted to put you into the prison,

263
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:50,096
正是这些人夺走了你的至爱  让你一无所有
the same people who killed everything you love and left you with nothing,

264
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:53,002
你女儿不想与你扯上关系
your daughter wants nothing to do with you

265
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:54,051
闭嘴
Shut up.

266
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:55,038
还有奥德莉·瑞恩斯
Audrey Raines--

267
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,009
我让你闭嘴
I said shut up.

268
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,024
不  杰克  我不会闭嘴
No, Jack, no.

269
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:58,063
我得让你知道这些
You need to hear this.

270
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,055
你必须回归现实世界
You need to start living in the real world!

271
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,048
你为政府工作的每一刻
Because every second you help the government

都在令泰瑞的墓碑蒙羞  够了  起来
You're spitting on Teri's grave  Enough! get up!

273
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,068
起来
Get up!

274
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:10,038
他失去控制了
He's losing it

275
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,060
装置在哪?
where's the device?

276
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:13,077
装置在哪
Tell me where the device is!

277
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:16,003
我发誓我会杀了你
So help me god, I will kill you.

278
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:17,065
这次你不会再活过来了
And you will stay dead this time.

279
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:20,007
装置在哪
Where is the device?

280
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,022
最后一次机会
last chance.

281
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:30,084
装置在哪  在哪
Where is it? Where is it?

282
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:35,053
深邃天空
Deep sky.  Jack

283
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:37,069
你说什么
What did you just say?

284
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,077
杂种
Son of a bitch.

285
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,078
再给他点时间
Give him a few more seconds.

286
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,025
再给时间  他就死了
A few more seconds, he'll be dead.

287
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:43,019
深邃天空
Deep sky.

288
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,005
杰克  放开他
Jack. Let him go.

289
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,032
把他弄出去
Get him out of here.

290
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:52,057
把他弄出去  快
Get him out of here now.

291
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,026
快找医务人员  给他检查一下

292
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,076
盯住他
Keep an eye on him.

293
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,079
深邃天空
Deep sky.

294
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:23,060
喂
Hello.

295
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,084
我是杰克·鲍尔
This is Jack Bauer.

296
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,026
说
Yes.

297
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:30,055
有人让我打给你
I was told to call you.

298
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,095
谁?
By whom?

299
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:33,078
托尼·阿尔梅达
Tony Almeida

300
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:39,025
他告诉我这个CTU旧的紧急电话
He gave me this old CTU emergency phone code.

301
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,024
深邃天空
Deep sky.

302
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,002
我是比尔  杰克
It's Bill, Jack.

303
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,019
比尔  究竟怎么回事
Bill, what the hell is going on?

304
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,038
托尼人呢
Where is Tony?

305
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,088
在FBI总部  他被逮捕了
FBI headquarters. He's been arrested.

306
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:54,000
逮捕了
Arrested?

307
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,086
他策划了今天的对美恐怖袭击
He orchastrated the terrorist attack on United States today.

308
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:59,003
我刚审讯过他
I was interrogating him.

309
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,047
你怎么参与进来的
How would you get involved in this?

310
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:04,005
FBI让我帮忙找到他
The FBI brought me in to help track him down.

311
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,021
我们需要谈谈  杰克
We need to talk, Jack.

312
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:07,099
我会用安全虚拟线路打给你
I'll call you back on a secure VPN line.

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,053
比尔  到底怎么回事
Bill, what the hell is going on?

314
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,009
给我10分钟设置虚拟网络
I need 10 minutes to set up the vpn...

315
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,061
10分钟太长了
I don't have 10 minutes.

316
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:14,037
就10分钟  杰克
10 minutes, Jack.

317
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:22,040
不敢相信
I can't believe this.

318
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:26,061
如果托尼被捕  那就完了
If Tony's been arrested, it's over

319
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:28,048
你打算告诉杰克真相吗
Are you gonna tell Jack everything?

320
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,085
想要让托尼恢复卧底
If we want to get Tony back under cover,

321
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,031
我们需要他
we will need his help.

322
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:34,003
我不认为目前杰克能帮到我们
I don't think Jack is in a very helpful frame of mind.

323
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,039
他是唯一的希望
He's our only hope.

324
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:55,024
你好  亨利
Hello, Henry

325
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:57,057
伊桑  桑加拉那里有消息
Ethan, I got your message about Sangala.

326
00:17:57,057 --> 00:17:58,080
阿利森在哪
Where is Allison?

327
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,061
在她办公室
She's in her office.

328
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:02,029
亨利
Henry.

329
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,009
总统现在身处两难境地
The president is in an impossible situation right now.

330
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,044
她需要你的支持
She needs your support.

331
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:13,011
但你帮不了她
But you can't give it to her

332
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:17,013
除非你放弃对罗杰的疯狂猜想
if you keep going on this paranoid fantacies about Roger.

333
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,057
我知道萨曼莎·罗斯
I know about Samantha Roth.

334
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,052
我知道你今天去她办公室找她
I know you accosted her in her office.

335
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:23,099
我儿子被杀一事  她有事瞒着我
She's hiding something about my son's murder.

336
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:26,053
罗杰没有被杀
Roger wasn't murdered.

337
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:28,058
他是自杀的
He committed suicide.

338
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:29,059
法医给出了结果
The coroner's office made that determination

339
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,034
FBI也已证实
and the FBI confirmed it.

340
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,025
他们调查不够深入
They didn't look hard enough.

341
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,029
伊桑  我了解我的儿子
Ethan, I know my son.

342
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:38,031
他没有自杀
He did not kill himself.

343
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,048
他没有压抑  没理由自杀
He wasn't depressed. He had no reason.

344
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:41,073
如果有理由呢
What if he did have a reason?

345
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:43,028
我岂会不知
I would have known.

346
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:45,026
你不知  因为他没告诉你
Not if he didn't tell you.

347
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,033
自愧而不敢告诉你
Not if he was too ashamed to tell you

348
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,054
以及总统
or the president.

349
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:50,018
你说什么
What are you talking about?

350
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:55,076
SCC本打算对罗杰进行内部交易的调查
Roger was about to be investigated by the sec for insider trading.

351
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,082
他利用了特殊的信息渠道
He'd used information he only could have gotten through

352
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:01,066
与总统的接近
his access to the president.

353
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:04,067
在SCC还未开展调查之前
Before the sec opened the investigation,

354
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:06,097
他自杀了
he killed himself.

355
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:09,007
我不信
I don't believe it.

356
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:11,030
都在这儿
It's all in here.

357
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:15,034
sec文件里都有记录
In the sec case file.

358
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,005
为什么我才听说此事
Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this?

359
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,080
弗兰克·博伊兰同意搁置此案
Frank boylan agreed to bury the case.

360
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,026
作为对总统的政治帮助
As a political favor to the president.

361
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:26,009
我妻子知道此事  因此不告诉我
My wife knew about this and she didn't tell me?

362
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:27,052
她想告诉你
She wanted to.

363
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:30,088
但她更想保护你对儿子的记忆
But she also wanted to protect your memory of your son.

364
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:32,062
你沉浸于痛苦之中
You were in so much pain.

365
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:34,087
该死  伊桑  他是我儿子  我有权知道
Damn it, Ethan. He was my son. I deserve the truth.

366
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:37,020
不该对你隐瞒
And keeping it from you was a terrible mistake.

367
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,027
我现在意识到了
I realize that now.

368
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,023
但总统和我都认为
But the president and I both thought you were

369
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,068
你已经重新步入生活了
moving on with your life.

370
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:46,041
卡宁先生
Mr. Kanin.

371
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,081
总统要见您
The president wants to see you.

372
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:54,032
她知道你告诉我此事吗
Does she know you're telling me this now?

373
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:58,099
不  我认为我们最好继续心照不宣
No. And I think it best we keep it that way,

374
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:02,079
至少等此次危机解决之后
at least till this crisis is resolved.

375
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:17,030
我认为必须告诉他  抱歉  先生
I feel I have to tell him, sir. I'm sorry.

376
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:27,025
好的  谢谢
Alright, thank you.

377
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:30,088
总统阁下  你要见我
Madam president, you wanted to see me?

378
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,059
史密斯上将给出了撤军时间表
Admiral Smith laid out the timeline of withdrawing our forces.

379
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,065
他说为满足杜巴库的要求
He's saying to meet Dubaku's demands,

380
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:42,014
我们必须在下午1点前发令撤离
we need to order the pullback by 1 pm.

381
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,099
时间紧迫
That's not much time.

382
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:45,081
是的
No, it isn't.

383
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:50,050
也许阿尔梅达会告诉我们CIP装置在哪
Well maybe this Almeida will tell us where to find the CIP device.

384
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,014
不  提姆·伍兹刚从调查局收到消息
No. Tim Woods just heard from the Bureau.

385
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:55,036
目前为止  阿尔梅达拒绝合作
So far Almeida's refusing to cooperate.

386
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:57,043
也许他是在故作姿态  想要开条件
Well maybe he's just positioning for a deal.

387
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:58,094
提姆认为不是
Tim doesn't think so.

388
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:01,092
他说我们不能指望阿尔梅达开口
He said we shouldn't count on Almeida to talk.

389
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,091
明白了
I see.

390
00:21:04,078 --> 00:21:06,085
所以
So

391
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:11,028
除非我命令军队撤退
unless I order our forces to stand down.

392
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:16,012
否则我将给美国人民带来死亡
I'll be condemning innocent Americans to death.

393
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,042
但如果我方屈服
And if we capitulate,

394
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:22,087
无数桑加拉人民将遭屠杀
thousands of Sangalas will be slaughtered.

395
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:32,017
怎么会这样  ethan
How did this happen, Ethan?

396
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:37,002
我们竟如此麻痹大意
How could we been so caught off guard,

397
00:21:37,002 --> 00:21:41,027
逼我在两难之中做出抉择
and now I have to decide between two impossible choices.

398
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,018
至少其中一者尚有机会
Well, at least one of those choices does stand a good chance

399
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:49,063
保住美国人民的生命
of preserving American lives.

400
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:51,008
你是说撤退
You mean withdrawal.

401
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:54,014
时间不多  我们必须考虑此可能性
We are nearing the time and we have to consider it.

402
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:57,037
还没到这境地  ethan
We're not there yet, Ethan.

403
00:21:57,037 --> 00:21:59,039
我不能讨论此事
I can't discuss this.

404
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,061
先要尝试所有可能的其他选择
Not until we have explored every possible option.

405
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:08,013
让FBI继续审问阿尔梅达
Tell the FBI to keep working on Almeida.

406
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,005
是  总统阁下
Yes, madam president.

407
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:22,065
布坎南  安全线路设置完成
Mr. Buchanan. I've got the secure line.

408
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:25,097
好的  接通他
All right. Dial the number.

409
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:32,033
比尔  别打马虎眼了  究竟发生了什么
Bill, stop screwing around. Tell me what the hell is going on!

410
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:34,030
托尼不是恐怖份子  杰克
Jack, Tony is not a terrorist.

411
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,044
他正执行卧底行动  同我合作
He's working deep cover. He's working with me.

412
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:39,007
有证据表明他曾试图摧毁两架商务客机
We have proof that he tried to bring down two commercial airliners.

413
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,043
你不明白他的处境
You don't know the whole story.

414
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:41,089
这是行动的一部分
That's part of an ongoing operation.

415
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:44,019
行动  什么行动
Operation? What kind of operation

416
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:46,045
会危机到成百上千的生命
puts hundreds if not thousands of lives in danger.

417
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,082
杰克
Jack, please.

418
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:49,016
听我说
You need to listen.

419
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:50,059
政府腐败不堪
Our government is corrupted.

420
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,074
政府内部有人
There are people on the inside

421
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:55,021
积极帮助dubaku和朱玛篡权
who are actively aiding Dubaku and Juma regime.

422
00:22:56,088 --> 00:23:01,033
问题是  托尼本该守在CIP模块边
Point is Tony was supposed to be near the CIP module the whole time.

423
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:04,039
他被捕后  我们便无法
With him in custody, we've lost our ability

424
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,012
控制并破坏此阴谋
to control it and to attack this conspiracy.

425
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:08,009
谁参与了此阴谋  给我名字
Who's a part of the conspiracy? Give me names.

426
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:09,071
我们不知道具体人员
We don't know the extent of it.

427
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,024
我们有理由相信
We have reason to believe

428
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,005
总统的内阁成员牵涉其中
that members of the president's inner council are on payroll.

429
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,099
谁向你透露的消息  哪个机构
Who's sheperding you this information? Which agency?

430
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:16,013
别追问了  杰克  没有人透露消息
Let's just take it, Jack. There's no sheperd.

431
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:20,074
也没有机构  此次腐败牵涉甚广
There is no agency. This corruption runs deep and wide.

432
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:23,000
我们是背着政府在行动
We're working outside the government.

433
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,050
因此必须让托尼恢复卧底身份
It's why we have to get Tony back under cover.

434
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,075
他可是在FBI总部  比尔
He's at FBI headquarters, Bill.

435
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:29,029
我知道此事不易
I never said it's gonna be easy.

436
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:31,035
但我们必须尽力而为
But we have to try.

437
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:35,009
克罗伊已进入他们的系统
Chloe is already into their system.

438
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,046
克罗伊也参与此事
Chloe's working on this?

439
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,068
杰克  听到你的声音真好
Hi, Jack. It's good to hear your voice.

440
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:39,080
你也是
Yeah. You, too.

441
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,055
我在公共事务频道看到了你的听证会
I saw the hearing on c span

442
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:44,004
不敢相信参议员竟如此对你
I can't believe what the senator said to you.

443
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:45,086
你看上去很沉着
You looked good go.

444
00:23:45,086 --> 00:23:48,062
杰克  我们需要你帮忙把托尼弄出来
Jack we need your help to get Tony out of there.

445
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:51,066
有位FBI探员蕾妮·沃克  她可以帮忙
There's an agent at the FBI Renee Walker. She could help.

446
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,085
不行  FBI有内鬼
No, the FBI has been compromised.

447
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:56,004
调查局内部有人暗中帮助杜巴库
Somebody in the bereau is aiding Dubaku.

448
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:57,083
你不明白  比尔  杰克  我信任她
You don't understand, Bill, jack, I trust her.

449
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,068
如果你认为必须用到她
Jack, if you think you need to use her

450
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:02,005
才能把托尼弄出FBI总部  那就听你的
to get Tony out of FBI headquarters, then do it.

451
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,034
但你此举会让她成为众矢之的
But you'll be making her a target.

452
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,009
你说得对
No, you're right.

453
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:10,033
你说得对  按你说的  我可以独自找到托尼
You're right. We'll do it your way. I can get to Tony myself.

454
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,001
但克罗伊得想法把我们弄出去
But Chloe's gonna have to get us outside the building.

455
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,035
我们已开始行动
We're already on it.

456
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,048
准备好了通知我
Get back to me as soon as you are ready.

457
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,000
我上路了  克罗伊
I'm on my way, Chloe.

458
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:42,058
西恩  我们上周下载的数据挖掘插件
Hey, Sean. You know these data mining plugins we downloaded last week,

459
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:44,083
存放在哪里了
where do we file those?

460
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:48,042
存放在哪里了
Where do we file those?

461
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:51,029
A76文件夹
Yeah. File folder A76.

462
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,072
你需要帮忙吗
Do you need help with something?

463
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:54,020
不用  怎么
No. Why?

464
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,015
你看上去很困惑
You seem confused.

465
00:24:56,015 --> 00:25:00,029
我只是不喜欢在4级防范禁闭中工作
I just don't like having to dance around this level-4 lockdown.

466
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:04,035
我还以为你想找机会抱怨一番
Oh, well, I thought you welcomed the opportunity to complain about something.

467
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:36,097
喂
Hello?

468
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:39,022
泰勒先生  我是萨曼莎
Mr. Taylor. It's Samantha.

469
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:42,079
我本打算找你的
I was going to call you.

470
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:45,086
我要向你道歉  萨姆
I owe you an apology, Sam.

471
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,016
我不该那样质疑你
I was wrong to confront you like that.

472
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:51,053
不  你没错
Uh, no. You weren't.

473
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:54,096
我并未对你完全坦诚
I wasn't completely honest to you.

474
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,099
什么意思
What do you mean?

475
00:25:58,012 --> 00:26:01,008
罗杰没有自杀  taylor先生
Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr. Taylor.

476
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:03,086
他是被谋杀的
He was murdered.

477
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:09,064
我想单独见你
I need to see you. Alone.

478
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:12,003
你能来吗
Will you meet me?

479
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:15,070
当然
Of course.

480
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,021
CIP装置在哪  托尼
Where is the CIP device, Tony?

481
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:23,024
你给谁了
Who would you gave it to?

482
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:28,027
付给你的这些家伙
People you're taking money from.

483
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:32,030
你也许想看看他们的杰作
Thought you might like to see some of their handywork.

484
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:37,063
你知不知道自从他们回到桑加拉
You know how many people they've killed

485
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:40,060
他们已屠杀了多少人
since they went back into Sangala?

486
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:46,066
20万人  还在不断上升
Two hundred thousand and counting.

487
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:48,029
绝大多数是女人和孩子
Most of them women and children.

488
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,056
托尼
Tony.

489
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:55,050
难道你的良心希望如此吗
You really want this on your conscience?

490
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,043
我问心无愧
My conscience is clear.

491
00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:06,093
你说什么做什么都没用
There's nothing you can say or do will change that.

492
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,080
你还是放聪明些
So why don't you do the smart thing

493
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:11,032
劝泰勒总统撤走她的打击力量
and tell president Taylor to stand down the strike force?

494
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:13,074
如若不从
Because unless she does,

495
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:16,095
就等着天上下飞机雨吧
planes will be falling from the sky.

496
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,083
到时候你就有一整本新的照片可以观赏
And then you'll have a whole new batch of photoes to look at.

497
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:26,092
但这次  死的将是美国人
Only this time, they'll be of dead Americans.

498
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:32,001
拉里  我们谈谈
Larry, we need to talk.

499
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:47,028
阿尔梅达不会屈服的
Almeida's not gonna break.

500
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:48,042
未必
We don't know that.

501
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,008
他是训练有素的CTU探员
He's a trained CTU agent.

502
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,093
他作为审讯者经历过同样的审讯
He's conducted interrogations just like this one.

503
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:53,081
你能说的任何话
There's nothing you can say to him

504
00:27:53,082 --> 00:27:55,066
他都早已对自己说过千遍
that he hasn't said to himself a hundred times.

505
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:56,096
那你有何建议  放弃
So what are you suggesting? We give up?

506
00:27:56,097 --> 00:28:01,040
不是  我建议采取更强硬的方式
No. I'm suggesting we might need more forceful approach.

507
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,098
你指刑讯
You mean torture.

508
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,037
有多种高压审讯方式
No, there are methods of coercion

509
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:07,011
我们尚未考虑
that we haven't even considered. Pharmaceuticals...

510
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:10,032
不敢相信你会这么说
I can't believe you wanna have this conversation.

511
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:12,001
我还没有提出论点
You're not hearing the argument...

512
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:15,017
你的论点疯狂至极  这是违法的
The argument is crazy. It's illegal.

513
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:17,083
不许再提  说真的  我要鲍尔离开
And it's over. As a matter of fact, I want Bauer out of here.

514
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,035
他是不稳定因素  留下他太危险了
He's a wildcard. He's dangerous.

515
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:20,087
我要他马上离开大楼
I want him out of the building.

516
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:22,028
去给他办手续  我继续审问
Go. Process him out. I will continue here.

517
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:26,022
快走
Go. Go! Now.

518
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,095
蕾妮  我正要给你打电话
Renee, I was just about to call you.

519
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,072
我可能发现内鬼了
I may have found the leak.

520
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:48,016
有人在4极防范禁闭下露出了马脚
Someone did a runaround under level-4 lockdown.

521
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,016
他们绕过了安全防火墙
They circumvented the security fence

522
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:51,087
并侵入了航空局的数据库
and they hacked into the FAA database.

523
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:53,004
航空局  你确定
FAA, are you sure?

524
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:54,030
确定  我不清楚他们在做什么
Positive. I don't what they were doing in there,

525
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:57,002
但必须使用极复杂的外挂软件才能实现
but they had to navigate some very sophisticated tagger software.

526
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:58,096
几分钟前
Just a few minutes ago.

527
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:00,008
知道是谁吗
Any idea who it was?

528
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:02,023
不知  但我可以查出登陆终端的账号
No. But I may be able to pull out user ID out of the terminal.

529
00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:03,030
好的  哪个终端
Okay, which terminal?

530
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:04,073
主机房  三号终端
Main frame room, terminal three.

531
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:07,013
-赶快查  有消息告诉我  -好的
- Check it out. Let me know what you find. - Ok.

532
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,096
泰勒探员
Agent Tyler.

533
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:12,024
你把杰克·鲍尔的简报资料准备好
I need you to prepare the briefing package for Jack Bauer

534
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:13,064
把他的个人物品给我
and bring me his personal effects.

535
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,070
好的  马上拿来
Yeah, I'll bring them right to you.

536
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:16,081
谢谢  我就在办公室
Thanks. I'll be in my office.

537
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:04,029
上次登陆  西恩·希林格
Last login: Sean Hillinger

538
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,095
你在干什么
What are you doing?

539
00:30:07,068 --> 00:30:09,036
怎么回事
What's the matter?

540
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:13,067
你在原地别动
Just, you just stay where you're.

541
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:17,024
詹尼斯  住手
Janis, stop it.

542
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:19,072
你说句话好吗
Would you just talk to me?

543
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:23,056
我知道你在帮助托尼·阿尔梅达
I know you've been helping Tony Almeida.

544
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,095
什么  你疯了不成
What? Are you crazy?

545
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:25,071
没有
No.

546
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:27,021
你侵入了航管局数据库
You broke into the FAA database,

547
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:29,033
那是你的服务器名称
that's your server ID.

548
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:31,033
对  是我的服务器ID
Yes, my server ID,

549
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:32,053
可我没有协助恐怖分子
but I'm not helping the terrorists,

550
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:33,062
你想知道我为何去那里
you wanna know why I was in there,

551
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:34,074
告诉你  因为我担心
I'll tell you, I was worried.

552
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:37,029
我妻子在其中一架飞机上
My wife on of those planes up there,

553
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,007
我想知道她的飞机是否已被禁飞
I had to see if her flight had been grounded yet.

554
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:40,012
你以为我会信这鬼话吗
You expect me to believe that?

555
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,072
你为何鬼鬼祟祟
Why are you sneeking around?

556
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:44,085
四级锁定模式把我踢出了航管局数据库
'cause the level 4 lockdown cut me out of the FAA database

557
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:46,098
我没法了解她的航班动向
I couldn't monitor her flight.

558
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,083
你自己来看
Look, see for yourself.

559
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,006
从赌城起飞的112号航班
Flight 112 out of the Las Vegas.

560
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:01,043
克里斯蒂娜·希林格
Christina Hillinger

561
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:03,030
好  待在那里别动
Okay, just stay there.

562
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,006
克里斯蒂娜·希林格
CHRISTINA HILLINGER

563
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:09,097
天啊  肖恩  你吓死我了
God, Shawn, you scared the hell outta me,

564
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:11,041
为何不早说
why wouldn't you just tell me that?

565
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:13,017
因为那是在打擦边球
'cause what I was doing was borderline illegal,

566
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,079
不想让你惹上麻烦
I didn't wanna get you in trouble.

567
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,065
你当时也焦头烂额了
plus, you looked like you've had enough on your plate.

568
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:19,067
可恶  我刚上报说有安全漏洞
Damn it, I told Renee I'd found a security leak.

569
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:21,011
出了什么事
Is that what's going on around here?

570
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,056
只是安全漏洞吗
There's just a security leak?

571
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:24,067
别管了  回到你的工作台
Don't worry about it, go back to your station,

572
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:25,091
不要声张
keep this to yourself

573
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,018
我会为你收拾这烂摊子
and I will clean up your mess.

574
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,016
去吧
Go.

575
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,055
白痴
Idiot.

576
00:31:40,008 --> 00:31:41,035
请讲
Go ahead.

577
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:42,085
杰克  沃克探员在走廊里
Jack, agent Walker is on her way,

你的循环程序进展如何
How are you doing with the loops?

581
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,086
正在投掷第一个循环
I'm dropping the first one in now.

582
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,009
我有一系列循环程序
I have a series of loops

583
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,080
你边走我边投
and I'm dropping them as you go.

584
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,099
保安不会发现
Security won't see a thing.

585
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:55,078
明白
Understand.

586
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,004
原地待命
Standing by.

587
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,061
抱歉  杰克  我们的行动没带上你
Sorry, Jack. We're proceeding without you.

588
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:13,022
不是我的决定
Wasn't my decision.

589
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,071
没有你  我们抓不到阿尔梅达
Well, we would't have Almeida without you,

590
00:32:16,072 --> 00:32:18,061
我们欠你人情
we own you alot.

591
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,039
谢了
Thanks.

592
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,047
是要我签字的文件吗
That paperwork for me?

593
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:24,092
嗯  要你填一下
Yeah, you need to fill this out.

594
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:33,084
我会在司法部为你美言几句
I'm gonna put in a good word with the Justice Department for you.

595
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:36,009
也许会有帮助
Maybe it will help.

596
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,070

放下武器  快
Put your weapons down, now!

618
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:03,036
你这是干什么
What the hell do you think you're doing?

619
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:05,031
我让你立即放下武器
I said do it now!

620
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,088
不然我杀了他
Do it or I will kill him.

621
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,046

00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,060
沃克探员人在哪里

631
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,017

634
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:40,034
我让你闭嘴
I said shut up.

635
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:43,031
我和比尔通过话了
I talked to Bill.

636
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:44,031
他告诉过你多少事
How much did he tell you?

637
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:46,033
够多了  我们要把你救出去
Enough, we're gonna get you outta here.

638
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:48,018
克罗伊已经侵入了保安系统
Chole's tapped into the security.

639
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:49,035
她会指引我们出去
She's gonna walk us outta this building,

640
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:50,090
你跟着我就行
all you need to do is follow my lead.

641
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,095
克罗依  我是杰克  收到了吗

我带你们去西南出口
I'm gonna direct you to the southwest exit.

646
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:01,069
你们当前在这栋建筑人口最稀少的区域
Right now you're in the least populated area of the building.

647
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:04,029
不过在你们出去前会遇到很多险阻
But you're gonna run into a lot more resistance before you get outta there.

648
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:05,030

杰克  我为我先前说过的话道歉
Listen, Jack, i'm sorry for the stuff I said back there.

654
00:35:26,072 --> 00:35:28,038
为了告诉你比尔的代号
Just needed to get you close enough

655
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:29,089
必须让你接近我
to give you Bill's codename.

656
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,046
我没拧断你的脖子真是万幸
Just glad I didn't break you neck.

657
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,016
差一点
Well, you came close.

658
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:38,099
嗯  不好意思
Yeah, sorry about that.

659
00:35:39,046 --> 00:35:40,015
好了  安全
Okay, clear.

660
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:42,006
安全了
We're clear.

661
00:35:57,045 --> 00:35:58,076
清理完了你的蛛丝马迹
I cleaned up your trail,

662
00:35:58,076 --> 00:36:01,096
这次违规不要对第三人说
we will just keep this transgression between us.

663
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:04,040
尽管我还不知道该怎么对蕾妮说
Although I don't know what I'm gonna tell Renee.

664
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:06,042
你听到我说什么了吗
Have you heard one thing I've just said?

665
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:09,003
嗯  好  看看这个
Yeah, yeah, that's fine, take a look at this.

666
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:10,043
什么
What?

667
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:13,035
一个信号路由器性能出现异常
There's a performance hit on one of our signal routers,

668
00:36:13,035 --> 00:36:15,035
下降了0.7%
It's down 0.7%

669
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:24,035
你说的对  有人在侵占我们的带宽
You're right, somebody is riding our bandwith.

670
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:27,005
侵入系统  可能吗  有那么多防火墙
Hecking in, is that possible? With all the safeguards?

671
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:28,046
如果是行家
Anything is possible

672
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:30,026
一切都有可能
if you know what you're doing.

673
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,091
他们在我们的安全子网里
They're inside our security sub-net.

674
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,000
已经侵入了监视系统
They've accessed the surveillance system.

675
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:37,060
你想怎么办
What are you gonna do?

676
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,079
锁定他们
Lock them out.

677
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:51,098
杰克  沿着下个走廊左转
Okay, Jack, you're gonna make a left down the next hallway.

678
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:54,017
路尽头有个消防梯
There's an emergency stairwell at the end.

679
00:36:54,017 --> 00:36:55,080
消防梯通向地面吗
Will that stairwell get us down the ground level?

680
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,082
对
Yes.

681
00:36:56,082 --> 00:36:58,033
收到
Copy that.

682
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:06,031
等下
Hold on.

683
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,031
什么事
What's wrong?

684
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:08,093
失去传输信号了
I lost my feed.

685
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:10,091
克罗依那里的信号出现故障
Chole's feed just went down.

686
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:14,077
你做了什么
What did you do?

687
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:16,061
我测试了那条线路  让它重启了
I've pinged the line and it automatically reset.

688
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:18,011
确实有人侵入
Someone was hacking in,

689
