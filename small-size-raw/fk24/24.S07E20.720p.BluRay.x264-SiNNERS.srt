00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:14,051
《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

2
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,050
你要我把那群调查局探员全都炸上天吗
You want me to blow up a couple of dozen FBI agents?

3
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:19,078
有什么问题吗
You got a problem with that?

4
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,051
沃克探员  我是杰克
Agent Walker, this is Jack.

5
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:23,038
让你的人撤出那栋楼  那是个陷阱
Get your men out of the building... It's a trap.

6
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,025
毒气罐还在吧
You got the canister?

7
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,062
很明显  霍奇斯是幕后主谋
Clearly, Hodges is behind this.

8
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:34,059
把他带去调查局审问
I want him taken to the FBI for interrogation.

9
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,044
妈  他是反社会者
He's a sociopath, mom.

10
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,092
他不会交代的  他一定会
He's not going to talk... he's going to want

11
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:40,016
以合作为条件来跟你谈交易
To make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation.

12
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:42,070
-妈  你不会出此下策吧  -奥利维亚
- Mom, you're not considering that. - Olivia...

13
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:45,027
你了解这个人  明白他都对罗格做了什么
You know what this man is, what he did to Roger.

14
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:47,031
是我搅了局  对吧
I've upset the cart, have I?

15
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,011
你为我们研制的生化武器
That bioweapon that you developed

16
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:51,028
不应用作私人用途
For us was not intended for personal use.

17
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,041
我想我们可以达成一致
I think we can both agree

18
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,025
你的家人没有必要
That there's no reason for your family

19
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:55,061
为你的错误付出代价
To pay for your mistakes.

20
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,048
这会让你心跳停止
This will induce a cardiac arrest

21
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,012
而且可以在你体内不留痕迹
And leave no trace in your system.

22
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:08,036
我们改变路线去西阿林顿医院
We are rerouting to west arlington hospital.

23
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:10,060
有阿尔梅达的消息吗
Have you heard from Almeida?

24
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:12,050
见到霍奇斯之前我给他打了电话
I called him before I met with Hodges.

25
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:14,030
他拿到毒气罐了吗
Has he secured the canister?

26
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:15,030
-很快  -他是你的人
- Soon. - He's your guy.

27
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,060
最好别搞砸了
He better not screw this up.

28
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,084
我相信他能把事办妥
I have faith he'll come through.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,044
你为什么不回到局里让他们给你治疗下
Why don't you go back to FBI medical and let them treat you?

30
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:24,094
无药可救的
There is no treatment.

31
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,038
好不了了
There is no cure.

32
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,071
杰克  他们好像知道我们的计划
Almost like they knew, Jack.

33
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:28,071
他们在楼内布置炸药
They would have needed Time

34
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:29,082
总要花时间的
To wire this building with explosives.

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,058
这是我们计划搜索的最后一个区域
This is the last sector we were due to search.

36
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:33,029
杰克  怎么了
Jack, what is it?

37
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,092
你到底扮演什么角色
What is your involvement?

38
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:37,012
你头脑不清醒了
You're not thinking straight.

39
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,016
毒素在影响你的判断能力
The toxings starting to affect your judgment.

40
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,013
-快把枪放下吧  -你别动
- Now, why don't you put the gun down. - Don't you move!

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,076
我从没想过要伤害你  杰克
I never wanted to hurt you, Jack.

42
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,030
我告诉过你别管闲事
I told you to stay out of it.

43
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:49,040
这里需要帮助
We get some help here?

44
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,000
他开始抽搐了
This man's having a seizure.

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,096
以下情节发生在凌晨3点至4点间
The following takes place between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.

46
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,003
鲍尔先生  你现在应该会感觉好很多
Mr. Bauer, you should be feeling better already.

47
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,017
我正给你静脉注射5毫升的盘多帕敏
I'm giving you five CC's of intravenous Pendopamine.

48
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,044
会缓解肌肉痉挛
It'll de-constrict your muscles.

49
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:24,061
坚持一下
Just hang in there.

50
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:27,059
别说话  你的声带还在痉挛中
Don't talk. Your vocal cords are in spasm.

51
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:29,088
究竟发生了什么事
What the hell happened?

52
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,025
托尼·阿尔梅达发现他全身抽搐
Tony Almeida found him in full seizure.

53
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,068
你给他的药包呢
What about the medication pack you gave him?

54
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,005
他没带
Wasn't carrying it.

55
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,035
制  制  制止
S-s-stop.

56
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:36,082
鲍尔先生  请不要讲话
Mr. Bauer,please don't speak.

57
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,089
制止
Stop...

58
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:39,009
托尼
Tony...

59
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:40,022
托尼
Tony?

60
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,052
我不明白
I don't understand.

61
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:43,076
他就是暗中协助的第二人
He's second man.

62
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,069
-杰克  什么  -快发全面缉捕通告
- Jack, what... - Put out an APB.

63
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:47,023
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

64
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,006
快做
Do it!

65
00:02:49,013 --> 00:02:50,049
所有巡逻队和周边小组注意
Attention, all patrols and perimeter teams,

66
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,045
我是A1小队
This is Alpha one.

67
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,063
现对托尼·阿尔梅达发出优先全面缉捕通告
I'm issuing a priority APB on Tony Almeida.

68
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:55,057
请小心行事
Approach with extreme caution.

69
00:02:55,064 --> 00:02:56,074
托尼是盖尔维兹的同谋
He's colluding with Galvez

70
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:57,081
应做敌人对待
And should be considered hostile.

71
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:01,084
发现疑犯的小组  应万分小心
All units who engage the suspect should do so with extreme caution.

72
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:26,053
你真的需要给自己多点时间恢复
You really need to give yourself more Time to recover.

73
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,004
这里还有一个药包
Here's another med pack.

74
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,060
这次可别再丢了
Make sure he doesn't lose it.

75
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:32,031
我要去照顾其他伤者了
I need to go tend to the other wounded.

76
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:36,048
好吧  告诉我到底怎么回事
All right,tell me what the hell is going on.

77
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:42,058
托尼一直就是盖尔维兹一伙的
Tony was working with Galvez all along.

78
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,099
他利用了我们所有人来得到那个毒气罐
He used us, all of us, so that he could get to the canister.

79
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,033
等等  你是说
So, wait, what are you saying, that...

80
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,006
托尼杀了拉里
Tony killed Larry?

81
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,060
是的
Yeah.

82
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:59,007
他们肯定是在直升机降落时偷袭了他
They must have ambushed him as the chopper was setting down.

83
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:02,030
托尼藏在幕后以便掌控我们的搜索情况
Tony stayed behind so he could monitor our search,

84
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:05,034
设下圈套  确保盖尔维兹可以逃出搜索线
Set the trap and make sure Galvez could get beyond the perimeter.

85
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,094
天哪
Oh, god.

86
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,068
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

87
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:12,015
这是我的错
This is my fault.

88
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:15,032
我还向你和总统担保他没问题
I vouched for him to you, to the president.

89
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:21,012
我犯了很严重很严重的错误
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

90
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,089
我是觉得不大对劲
I felt that something was wrong.

91
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,033
事情凑到一起讲不通
Things weren't adding up.

92
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,003
我只是
I just...

93
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:29,036
我只是想要相信他
I just wanted to believe him.

94
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:31,080
A1小队  我是基尔纳探员
Alpha one, this is agent Kilner.

95
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:33,043
我是A1小队  请讲
Alpha one... go ahead.

96
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,007
沃克探员  我在D检查站
Agent Walker, I'm at checkpoint Delta.

97
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,011
这里有两个探员死亡  近距离直射
I've got two agents dead, shot point-blank.

98
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:39,034
车辆丢失
Their vehicle is missing.

99
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,011
他应该过了封锁线了
Okay, he's made it past the perimeter.

100
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:43,071
车辆跟踪装置已失灵  无法确认位置
Tracking on the vehicle has been disabled. Position is unknown.

101
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:45,071
扩大封锁线  继续寻找阿尔梅达
Widen the perimeter, and keep looking for Almeida.

102
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,055
如果找不到他  就找不到毒气罐
If we lose him, we lose the canister.

103
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,012
你找不到他的  他逃脱了
You're not gonna find him... he's gone.

104
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,079
我们得打电话给总统
We need to phone the president.

105
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,099
走吧
Let's go.

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,060
你逃出来了
You made it.

107
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,017
你好像很惊讶
You sound surprised.

108
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:42,010
鲍尔叫住你后  我可不确定你还能脱身
After Bauer called you out, I wasn't sure you would.

109
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:46,031
你不必担心杰克·鲍尔
You don't have to worry about Jack Bauer.

110
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:48,054
他不再是问题
He's not gonna be a problem.

111
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,068
毒气罐在哪里
So, where is the canister?

112
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:54,098
钱呢
Where's the money?

113
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:59,015
我们不是说好的嘛
Hey, that was our agreement.

114
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:01,002
一手交钱  再一手交货
Money first.

115
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,040
在这
There you go.

116
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:13,030
钱都在那里  汇到你账户上了
It's all there, wired into your account.

117
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:15,090
不相信可以查查
You can check it if you want.

118
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:18,004
我是要查查
I want.

119
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,078
没问题吧
Everything okay?

120
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:30,032
没问题
Yeah.

121
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,095
那毒气罐在哪里
So, where is the canister?

122
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,029
就在这里
Right here.

123
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:48,067
你要拿它来干嘛
So, what are you planning on doing with it?

124
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,074
不关你的事  对吧
Not really your business, is it?

125
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:52,067
要卖掉吗
You gonna sell it?

126
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,042
别做傻事
You don't want to do this.

127
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,032
买家到底是谁
Hey, who's the damn buyer?

128
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,061
毒气罐在哪里
Where's the canister?

129
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:30,041
他妈的毒气罐在哪里
Where is the damn canister?!

130
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,082
押送霍奇斯的一名海军陆战队员
One of the marines that was guarding Hodges

131
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:36,078
发现他正试图吞下某种东西
Noticed he was trying to swallow something.

132
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:38,039
他阻止了他  在毒药被完全吸收前
He intervened, got him to the hospital

133
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,059
把他送到了医院
Before the poison could be completely ingested.

134
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,099
这么说  他活下来了
So, he'll survive?

135
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:45,026
是的  阁下  医生很惊讶他能活过来
Yes, ma'am, but the doctors are surprised he pulled through.

136
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,050
那是因为他们从来没遇到过这种混蛋
That's because they never met the son of a bitch.

137
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:49,023
霍奇斯是怎样拿到毒药的
How did Hodges get this poison?

138
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,010
我们怀疑是一个宣称是他律师的女人给他的
We suspect from a woman who claimed to be his attorney.

139
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:53,017
宣称
Claimed to be?

140
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,047
她是个冒牌货
She was an impostor.

141
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:56,026
首府警察在五分钟前发现了
DC police found the body of Hodges' real attorney

142
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,071
真正的霍奇斯律师的尸体
About five minutes ago.

143
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,097
我们还在努力调查
We're still trying to determine

144
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:00,071
她是怎样成功通过安检的
How she managed to breach security.

145
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:02,098
总统阁下  是沃克探员和杰克·鲍尔
Madam President, agent Walker and Jack Bauer.

146
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,055
-接过来  -是  阁下
- Put them through. - Yes,ma'am.

147
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,042
我是泰勒总统
This is president Taylor.

148
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:08,072
蒂姆·伍兹也在这里
I'm here with Tim woods.

149
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:09,082
总统阁下
Madam President...

150
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,055
找到毒气罐了吗
Have you secured the canister?

151
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:12,092
阁下  恐怕没有
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

152
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,076
我们的疑犯逃出了封锁线
Our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter.

153
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:17,026
你们不是说封锁那区域了吗
I was told that the area was locked down.

154
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,039
怎么回事
What happened?

155
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:20,026
他有帮凶  总统阁下
He had help, Madam President.

156
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,066
是托尼·阿尔梅达
From Tony Almeida.

157
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:23,036
阿尔梅达
Almeida?

158
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,060
是的  阁下
Yes, ma'am.

159
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,020
他为我们做事的啊
He was working for us.

160
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:27,060
这只是表象
It only appeared that way.

161
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,037
他显然是在执行自己的计划
Apparently, he was pursuing his own agenda,

162
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:31,000
想要弄到毒气罐
Trying to get his hands on the canister.

163
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,091
总统阁下  我知道是我担保的他
Madam President, I know I vouched for him.

164
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:34,048
现在我能讲的只有
All I can tell you right now

165
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:36,018
我错了  很抱歉
Is that I was wrong and I'm sorry.

166
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,048
既然现在毒气罐在他手上
Now that we know he has the canister,

167
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:39,041
知道他打算用来做什么吗
Do we have any idea what he intends to do with it?

168
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:41,042
-还不知道  -那他在哪里
- No, not yet. - Or where he is?

169
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:44,022
我们已召集所有人员重新部署寻找线索
We're all hands on deck here, sir, regrouping to develop leads.

170
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:46,089
我可能有一条线索
I may have one.

171
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:48,099
在霍奇斯被拘捕时
As Hodges was taken into custody,

172
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,019
他叫嚣说  在他被捕后
He yelled at me about some larger group

173
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,036
还有更大的组织会继续行动
That would continue on after his arrest.

174
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,040
干出一些我无法阻止的事情
Something that I wouldn't be able to stop.

175
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:56,080
您觉得他指的是什么
What do you think he meant?

176
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,010
我确定的是
Well, all I know for sure

177
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:00,003
有人不想让霍奇斯开口
Is that someone doesn't want Hodges to talk.

178
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,050
霍奇斯被捕后不久
Shortly after he was arrested,

179
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:04,034
就有个女人假扮他的律师来见他
Hodges was visited by a woman impersonating his lawyer.

180
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,064
显然  她给了他某种致命毒药
She apparently gave him some kind of lethal drug,

181
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:07,094
因为十分钟后
Because ten minutes later,

182
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:09,004
霍奇斯便企图自杀
He tried to commit suicide.

183
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:10,084
企图自杀
Tried to commit suicide?

184
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,041
他还活着
Oh, he's still alive.

185
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:15,005
乔纳斯·霍奇斯是个十足的老顽固
Jonas Hodges was completely unrepentant.

186
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,043
肯定是有人强迫他自杀
Now, this suicide attempt must have been coerced.

187
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:18,092
很明显  他们揪住了他的软肋来威胁他
Well, obviously, they're holding something over him,

188
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,012
很有可能是他的家人
Most likely his family.

189
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,032
如果真是这样  总统阁下
If that's the case, Madam President,

190
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,059
我们得跟他谈谈
We need to talk to him.

191
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:25,033
杰克  即使今天发生了这一切
Jack, even after everything that's happened today,

192
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,053
我还是不允许极端的审讯方式
I will not allow any kind of coercive interrogation.

193
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,063
总统阁下  没这个必要  他会开口的
Madam President, that won't be necessary. He'll talk.

194
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,020
你怎么那么肯定
How can you be sure?

195
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:34,027
因为我们会给霍奇斯他需要的东西
Because we can offer Hodges something that he needs.

196
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,005
是什么
And what's that?

197
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:36,008
制造他死的假象
Proof of death.

198
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,080
这样就能让那些想干掉他的人相信
We can convince the people that wanted him dead

199
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,077
他真的死了
that they succeeded.

200
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:41,024
只有这样  霍奇斯才能保护他家人
It's the only way Hodges can protect his family.

201
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,071
总统阁下  目前
Madam President, right now,

202
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,031
他是我们唯一的线索
He's the only lead we've got.

203
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,097
我就当你这样做很必要了
I'll assume that was necessary.

204
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,050
别惹我
Don't start with me.

205
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:08,027
我可没这个心情
I'm not in the mood.

206
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,077
好吧
All right.

207
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:14,071
盖尔维兹先生决定把毒气罐藏起来不给我
Mr. Galvez decided to hide the canister from me,

208
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,091
所以我得想办法找到罐子
So, uh, I had to find out where it was.

209
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:22,085
我们得去送货了
We've got a delivery to make.

210
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:24,012
可以走了吗
Shall we go?

211
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,085
我觉得我们不该去
No, I don't think we should.

212
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,006
他们在等我们
They're expecting us.

213
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,039
我的看法是
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

214
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,073
他们会拿走我流血得来的这个毒气罐
They're gonna take this canister that I sweated blood for

215
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,010
然后丢在角落六个月不闻不问
And sit on it for six months.

216
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:38,042
他们会用它制造更多的病原体
They're gonna use it to make more pathogen.

217
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,045
我们以前有27个毒气罐  现在只有1个
We had 27 canisters; now we have one.

218
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:42,012
没错  我说一个足够了
Yeah, and I say one's enough.

219
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:46,045
听着
Look...

220
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:49,052
政府不稳定
The government's reeling.

221
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,042
联邦调查局软弱无力
The FBI is stretched thin...

222
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,085
混乱不堪  错误百出
Scrambling, making mistakes.

223
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,089
我们只需今天再发动一次袭击
Another attack today is all we need

224
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:56,086
就能让整个事态发展到崩溃的边缘
To push this thing right over the edge.

225
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:59,069
现在绝不是撤退的时候
This is no Time to pull back.

226
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:03,030
我建议我们今天就拿着毒气罐
I say we take that canister,

227
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,047
去完成任务
And finish the job off today.

228
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:11,087
我不是不同意
I don't disagree with you

229
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:14,011
但这由不得我们决定
But it's not our decision to make.

230
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,067
好吧
Fine.

231
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:18,084
就让你们那群乌合之众去执行吧
Then run it by your group or your gang or whatever the hell they are.

232
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:23,024
但是他们早晚会知道
But they'll know one thing.

233
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,075
不趁机斩草除根
You finish your enemy off when he's down.

234
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:27,062
他们就会死而复生的
You don't let him get back up and reload.

235
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,055
我敢打包票
I guarantee you,this thing's gonna be

236
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:31,022
再拖6个月后
A hell of a lot harder

237
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,092
局势会更加艰难
To pull off six months from now.

238
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:36,009
不管你怎么评价乔纳斯·霍奇斯
And you can say what you want about Jonas Hodges,

239
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:38,009
但事实是
The fact is,

240
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,006
他今天给我们提供了一个机会
He gave us an opportunity today.

241
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,067
我们抓着它吧
Let's take it.

242
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:51,097
我联系一下组织里
I'll contact the group.

243
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:55,001
好
Good.

244
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,000
她具体说什么了
What did she say exactly?

245
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,077
只说她有急事
Only that she needs to see you

246
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,003
要见你
And that it's urgent.

247
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,004
我听到了关于调查局这次搜捕的一些流言
I heard rumors about the FBI operation.

248
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,090
你妈妈会详细的告诉你的
I'm sure your mother will fill you in

249
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:25,021
奥利维亚
Olivia.

250
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:27,024
调查局的封锁被突破了是真的吗
Is it true the FBI perimeter was breached?

251
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,055
是的
I'm afraid so.

252
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,001
毒气罐已被带到了警戒线之外
The canister is now outside the cordon.

253
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,052
有什么办法能把它找回来吗
What are we doing to get it back?

254
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:33,075
蒂姆  你先回避一下好吗
Tim,would you excuse us for a moment?

255
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:35,032
当然
Of course.

256
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,036
怎么了
What is it?

257
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,086
打电话给司法部长
I need you to call the attorney general

258
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:50,020
起草一份给乔纳斯·霍奇斯的证人保护协议
And draft a witness protection agreement for Jonas Hodges.

259
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:52,084
证人保护
Witness protection?

260
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,030
您是认真的吗
You can't be serious.

261
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:56,051
不到一个小时之前
Less than an hour ago,

262
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:58,068
霍奇斯企图自杀
Hodges tried to kill himself.

263
00:12:58,074 --> 00:13:01,001
我们认为他肯定是被胁迫的
And we all believe that he must've been coerced.

264
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,021
谁胁迫他
By whom?

265
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:04,015
还记得他之前的那次叫嚣吧
You remember his rant...

266
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:06,058
说他只是更大阴谋的冰山一角
That he is a cog in a larger conspiracy,

267
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,022
还有其他许多同伙前仆后继
That there are others who will carry on.

268
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,085
您认为是他们抢走了毒气罐
You think they're the ones who took the canister?

269
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:12,006
这个还需要调查
Well,we need to find out.

270
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,063
所以需要霍奇斯开口
Which is why we need to get Hodges to talk.

271
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,073
奥利维亚  我们觉得让那些想灭口的人
Olivia,we feel confident that he will

272
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:19,066
以为霍奇斯真的死了
If we can assure him that these people will believe

273
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,057
他就会说出线索
That his suicide attempt actually succeeded.

274
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:24,082
我们要让他人间蒸发
We need to make him disappear.

275
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:27,071
所以需要那个证人保护协议
Which is why I need the protection agreement.

276
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:29,045
没有别的让他开口的法子了
There is no other way he'll talk.

277
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,006
把他视为敌对分子
Designate him an enemy combatant,

278
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,030
对待他要像秋风扫落叶一般
Then treat him like one.

279
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,059
我们不能这么做
We don't do that.

280
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:35,003
至少我管理的政府不能
Not in this administration.

281
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,010
并不是说要给他自由了
And it's not as if he's getting a free pass.

282
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:40,010
他下半辈子都要在联邦监管之下过活了
He'll be under federal supervision for the rest of his life.

283
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,027
哦  是啊
Oh,yeah,

284
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,007
在科罗拉多洲100英亩的牧场里逍遥
On a hundred acre ranch in colorado!

285
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:48,047
你的亲生儿子死在他手里
This man murdered your son!

286
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:52,042
我的弟弟
My brother.

287
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,088
更不要提  数以百计的无辜平民
Not to mention hundreds of innocent civilians.

288
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,099
不用你提醒  我知道他做了什么
I don't need you to tell me what he's done.

289
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,039
很明显你需要我的提醒
Apparently you do.

290
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,053
-奥利维亚  别说了 -爸爸会怎么想
- Olivia,stop it! - What would dad say?

291
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:05,086
-你肯定问都不敢问  -你别说了
- I bet you're afraid to ask. - I said stop!

292
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:12,020
你觉得我就好受吗
Do you think this is easy for me?

293
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:16,058
难道他会觉得我不会伤心欲绝吗
if he think it doesn't tear me apart?

294
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:20,067
我是罗格的母亲
I'm Roger's mother.

295
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:28,056
但我同时也是美国的总统
But I am also the President of the United States

296
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:33,005
我手按圣经发过誓  要捍卫美国宪法
And I placed my hand on a Bible and swore to protect and defend the constitution.

297
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,067
你是我的参谋长
You are my chief of staff.

298
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,092
只管做好你的本职工作去
I need you to act like one.

299
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,051
乔纳斯·霍奇斯已关在调查局
Now,Jonas Hodges is at the FBI,

300
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:44,033
杰克·鲍尔马上就赶到
and Jack Bauer will be there shortly.

301
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,090
快点起草那个协议
I need an agreement drafted.

302
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:51,001
请照做
Do that please.

303
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,030
计划很简明
The plan is straightforward...

304
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,042
用托尼·阿尔梅达从斯塔克伍德
An attack today this morning

305
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:00,040
弄来的生化武器
During rush hour using the bioweapon

306
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,051
在今早高峰时段发动袭击
That Tony Almeida retrieved from Starkwood.

307
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:04,029
你们登陆上这个电话连线时
You should have each received a data pack

308
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,078
每人都会收到一份数据包
When you logged on to this call.

309
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:07,048
请看一下
Please open it now.

310
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:09,098
这次行动会被归咎于这个人
The attack will be attributed to this man,

311
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:11,099
吉布安·阿尔扎利安
Jibraan al-zarian.

312
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,060
他的尸体会留在现场
Whose body will be left at the scene.

313
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,027
留下的证据为
The evidence trail implicating him

314
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,093
捏造的电邮
Will include fabricated e-mails,

315
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,017
通话记录
Phone records,

316
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,027
和通过我们特选的
And a large wire transfer to his account

317
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:23,004
也门银行的帐户汇款
Via our favorite yemenI bank.

318
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,008
我在看这些材料
I'm looking at the briefing materials

319
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:27,024
看不出这人和恐怖组织
And I'm not seeing how this man is actually connected

320
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:28,065
有任何联系
To any terrorist group.

321
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:29,098
确实没有
He isn't.

322
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:31,025
按照之前讨论过的
As previously discussed,

323
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:33,008
用一个平民做掩护
There are considerable tactical advantages

324
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,042
会更有蒙蔽性
To using an innocent.

325
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,099
他的不可确定因素有多大
But what about his unpredictability?

326
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:38,012
他无所事事
Al-zarian has no agenda of his own.

327
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,026
比起恐怖分子
He'll in fact be easier to control and manipulate

328
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,055
更好控制和操纵他
Than a real terrorist.

329
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:45,026
估算伤亡人数有多少
So what are The casualty esTimates?

330
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:48,010
第三页有关于伤亡人数
Page three describes the casualties esTimates

331
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,047
和次级影响的估算
As well as secondary effects.

332
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:51,020
我们列出了
As you can see,we've listed

333
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:52,030
等会  先不要去管
Hold on Forget about

334
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:53,094
伤亡人数了
What casualties may or may not be.

335
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:56,011
我们在说几个小时之内
We're talking about launching a new operation

336
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:59,008
展开一次甚至连计划都没的新行动
In the next few hours. Without any planning.

337
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:00,064
而且只有一个毒气罐
And with only one canister.

338
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:03,018
行动计划已经有了
The plan for this operation was already in place.

339
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,098
只需抓紧时间
We'd just be accelerating the Timetable.

340
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,072
我们本来要花半年去准备
We were going to have six months to prepare.

341
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,099
不可能几个小时就完成
There's no way to pull it together in a few hours.

342
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:10,062
有可能的
I believe there is.

343
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,062
在这个组织的支持下
With the support of this group.

344
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:13,079
支持谁
Support for whom?

345
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:15,049
支持那个我们都不咋了解的托尼吗
This Tony Almeida we barely know?

346
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,010
袭击后的计划呢
And what about postattack plans?

347
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,033
该组织怎样以我们想要的方式完成使命
How's this group going to end up where we need to be?

348
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,090
我同意  袭击事件发生之后
I agree. How we handle ourselves politically

349
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,094
我们怎样在政坛上求得自保
In the aftermath of this event

350
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
这点和计划袭击一样重要
Is just as important as the attack itself.

351
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,094
你的意见总是认为
It always has been in your opinion

352
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,001
在当前方案下  有没有充足时间
Is there Time then to achieve

353
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:33,014
来达到我们所有的目的
All our objectives in the current scenario?

354
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:34,095
这些问题有些仍悬而未决
Not with the same level of certainty.

355
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:36,035
其保密的程度也大相径庭
Or anonymity.

356
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,061
没错
That's right.

357
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:39,088
结果很肯定的
Well,then,maybe it's,uh,definitive.

358
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:40,095
什么意思
What do you mean?

359
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:42,035
等待时机并无消极影响
There's no downside to waiting.

360
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,039
但是鲁莽的行为常常是失败的原因
There's a huge downside to going in unprepared.

361
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,082
一旦出了岔子
Things go wrong,

362
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,083
我们都会暴露
We're looking at exposure for all of us

363
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,040
不  我不是这么认为
No,no,I still don't see it that way.

364
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:54,040
先生们
Gentlemen.

365
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,043
女士们
Ladies.

366
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,060
我在你们的争论中
I've listened to your comments

367
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:01,075
听到了好主意
And there's wisdom in what I've heard.

368
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:05,071
但是还有一点你们没有想到
But there's also wisdom in something I haven't heard.

369
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:07,071
乔纳斯·霍奇斯是一个我型我素的人
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,

370
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,031
现在已经成功地摆脱了他
And the group is well rid of him.

371
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,035
但是他疯狂的行为对我们来说  倒不无益处
But,in his lunacy,he did us a favor.

372
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:16,025
一半工作他都做好了
He did half our job for us.

373
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:18,025
远不止一半
More than half.

374
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:20,082
他把这个国家推向了危机边缘
He pushed this country to the brink.

375
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,073
没有比这更好的了
You don't get many gifts like that.

376
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:27,076
我们要抓住这次机会
I say we take it.

377
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:31,037
现在马上进行投票表决
We have a quorum,I'd like to call for an immediate vote.

378
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,082
托尼
Tony.

379
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:54,076
怎么样了
How'd it go?

380
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,083
你自己看吧
Take a look.

381
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,014
我们可以放手干了
We're a go.

382
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:36,072
-霍奇斯现在何处  -走廊尽头
- Where's Hodges now? - Down the hall.

383
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,072
我们设了一个安全的医疗套间
We've set up a medical suite in secure.

384
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,022
死亡证明呢
And the death certificate?

385
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:41,059
已经好了
Done.

386
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:43,063
外界只会知道
As far as the world knows,he's molding on a slab

387
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:45,063
-他已经被验尸官盖上白布了  -保持这样
- At the coroner's. - Keep it that way.

388
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:47,066
除非必须不要让任何人知道他还活着
No one knows he's alive unless they have to.

389
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:49,053
只有救护车驾驶员
No,just the ambulance driver,

390
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,096
医疗队和三个警卫知道
The medical team and three security.

391
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:52,013
都是信得过的人
All trustworthy.

392
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,016
等会
Wait.

393
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:54,060
你确定他能胜任这事么
Are you sure he's up for this?

394
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,073
我知道发生了什么事
I know what happened out there.

395
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,007
药物起作用了  他没事的
Medication worked. He'll be okay.

396
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,037
我不是说痉挛的问题
I'm not talking about the seizure.

397
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,037
我是说托尼·阿尔梅达的境遇对他的影响
I'm talking about the Tony Almeida situation.

398
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:01,081
怎么了
What about it?

399
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,088
他的前搭档背叛了他
His former partner betrays him,

400
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:05,031
想杀了你们所有人
He tries to have you all killed...

401
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:07,071
杰克肯定会感觉很不好
Jack must have some feelings about that.

402
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:09,021
是啊
Yeah.

403
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,028
我想这也是激励他继续下去的原因
Yeah,I think it's what's keeping him going.

404
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:15,015
听我说
Listen to me.

405
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,049
听我说
Listen to me.

406
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,049
有人在吗
Is anyone listening?

407
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,049
知道你们在监视
I know you're watching.

408
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:21,049
我看到了摄像头
I see the cameras!

409
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:23,023
我知道你们在监视
I know you're watching.

410
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,073
你知道你们干了些什么吗
Do you realize what you people have done?

411
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,077
这不是救了我
You didn't save me,

412
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,060
你们害了我家人
You killed my family!

413
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,000
你们害了我家人
You killed my family!

414
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,066
你们害了他们
You killed them!

415
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:31,050
害了他们
Killed them.

416
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:33,011
-他清醒多久了  -10分钟
- How long has he been conscious? - Ten minutes.

417
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:35,095
从醒了就一直在说他的家人
He's been talking about his family ever since.

418
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:37,035
布置了生物监控仪器
Biometrics are over here.

419
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,015
心脏呼吸及红外体温监测  一切尽在掌握
Cardiac,respiratory,plus dermal infrared.

420
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:40,072
很好  那样我们就能判断他是不是在撒谎了
Good. We'll know if he's lying.

421
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,072
杰克
Jack,

422
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,059
总统也在看着呢
The president is monitoring this.

423
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:47,009
中士  求你了
Sergeant,I'm asking you,

424
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,026
两个军人之间的协议  把你的枪给我
Soldier to soldier,let me have your firearm.

425
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:52,043
我只会用一颗子弹
I'll use one... one bullet on myself.

426
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,047
求你了
Please.

427
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:54,087
放松点  霍奇斯先生
Relax,Mr. Hodges.

428
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:57,044
你已经死了
You're already dead.

429
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:02,044
中士
Sergeant.

430
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:06,055
你是谁
Who are you?

431
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:08,008
我是杰克·鲍尔
My name is Jack Bauer.

432
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:10,012
现在我是你家人
And right now,I'm the only chance

433
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,045
能继续活下去的唯一希望
Your wife and children have to stay alive.

434
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:14,049
说清楚
Explain that to me.

435
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:16,082
想杀你灭口的人不知道你还活着
The people that wanted you dead don't know you survived.

436
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,089
告诉我们他们的名字
Tell us who they are,

437
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,076
我们就会帮助你继续假死
And we'll keep it that way.

438
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,066
如果你提供给我们有价值的线索
The president has agreed to provide you with a death

439
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:23,083
总统会提供死亡证明
Certificate and witness protection in exchange

440
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,083
和证人保护计划给你
For actionable information.

441
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,047
我看不下去了
I can't watch this anymore.

442
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:28,084
你要是拒绝
If you refuse,it'll be released

443
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,017
我们会告诉媒体你还活着
To the press that you are alive and in our custody

444
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:32,044
并在我们的监管中很好的配合
And that you're cooperating.

445
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:34,057
剩下的就交给你那帮朋友了
We'll let your friends take care of the rest.

446
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:36,058
我家人是无辜的
My family is innocent.

447
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:39,014
总统不会怎么做的
The president would never allow that to happen.

448
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:41,081
她不会忍心的
She doesn't have the stomach for it.

449
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:43,088
你可能说的没错
You might be right about that.

450
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:47,012
但是别搞错了
But make no mistake about it,sir.

451
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,039
我会
I do.

452
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:52,049
相信我
Trust me.

453
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:54,009
为了你的家人
Do your family a favor.

454
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:57,016
告诉我你的同伙的名字
Just tell me who you've been working with.

455
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,054
我是
I am...

456
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:07,004
以前
I was...

457
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:09,038
是一个有共同理想的组织的一员
Part of a larger group of like minds.

458
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:11,071
你说像斯塔克伍德一样的公司
You mean,other companies like Starkwood.

459
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,045
我是说比政府更能
I mean people who can protect this country

460
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:14,098
保护这个国家的人
Better than any government ever could.

461
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:16,082
全国起码有数百家私营军事企业
There are hundreds of private military companies

462
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:18,002
那可是成千上万的人
In this country,we're talking tens of thousands of people.

463
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:21,002
可只有少数
But only a handful

464
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,016
有远见卓识  知道该做什么
With the guts and the vision to do what was necessary.

465
00:21:24,022 --> 00:21:25,032
做什么
And what is that?

466
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,069
我们计划在明年早些时候
The plan was to launch simultaneous attacks

467
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:29,016
对多个大城市
Early next year.

468
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:30,020
发动同步攻击
Multiple cities.

469
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,070
公众就会意识到
So the public would finally see

470
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:33,020
政府无法保全他们
That the government can't protect them.

471
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:35,064
然后他们会要求强力举措  我们就借此介入
They'd demand drastic measures and we'd step in.

472
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,064
你怎么向美国民众解释
How would you justify that to the American people?

473
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,080
很简单
Simple.

474
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:40,014
嫁祸他人
Offload the blame.

475
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:41,057
我们会支持那些
We were going to supply the enemies

476
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:43,031
想摧毁这个国家的敌人
That want to destroy this country.

477
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,004
张三李四王二麻子
Muhammed this,achmed that.

478
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,055
那些根本不存在的虚构组织
From sleeper cells the apologists say don't even exist.

479
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:48,055
这个你应该最清楚
You of all people should understand.

480
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:51,042
清楚什么
Understand what?

481
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:53,059
我昨天的听证会我看了
I watched the senate hearing yesterday,

482
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:56,059
很为你打抱不平  他们不应该这样对你
And I was disgusted with how you were treated.

483
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,059
你应该被视为英雄
You should be regarded as a hero,

484
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,043
而不是罪犯
Not a criminal.

485
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:04,040
我犯了法
I broke the law.

486
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,037
你只是本能地
You were following

487
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:09,050
去保护你的国家  就像我
Your instinct to protect your country,just like me.

488
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:10,080
霍奇斯先生  我需要你说出
Mr. Hodges,I need the names

489
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:12,050
同党的名字
Of the people that you are working with.

490
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:14,087
我一生都致力于保护这个国家
I have spent my entire life protecting this country

491
00:22:14,094 --> 00:22:17,011
免受外敌的侵扰
From enemies large and small.

492
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:19,014
我白手起家创立了斯塔克伍德
I created Starkwood from the ground up.

493
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,008
并为政府立下了汗马功劳
And the government used us to great effect.

494
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:23,048
现在他们却要过河拆桥
And now they think they can just throw us away.

495
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:25,042
你是要告诉我  你做这些
Are you telling me that this has been

496
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:26,089
只是想保护你的合同  你的利益吗
About protecting your contracts,about money?

497
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:30,002
我试图告诉那些政客美国有多么脆弱
I tried to tell the politicians how vulnerable we are,

498
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:31,049
可他们根本不在意
And they wouldn't listen.

499
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:33,006
所以我们决定展示给他们看
So we decided to show them.

500
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:36,006
用生化武器攻击你自己的国家吗
By attacking your own country with a biological weapon?

501
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:37,066
杀害无辜的百姓吗
By killing innocent people?

502
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:40,050
没错  牺牲一小部分人
Yes,a few innocent lives would be lost,

503
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:42,047
是为了拯救更多的人
But only to save the greater number.

504
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:43,097
有勇气作出这些艰难的决定
Having the courage to make those hard choices

505
00:22:44,004 --> 00:22:45,044
在这点上  我们还是有很多相同之处
Gives us a lot in common,Mr. Bauer.

506
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:47,071
我来解释给你听吧
Let me explain something to you.

507
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:51,014
我和你毫无相同之处可言
You and I have absolutely nothing in common.

508
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:53,078
你今天的所作所为是想要
All that you have done today is create a scenario

509
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:55,008
攻击你自己的国家
By attacking your own country

510
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:56,065
来展示你的价值
That has made you valuable again.

511
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:58,015
这完全是一次
Today has been nothing short

512
00:22:58,022 --> 00:22:59,079
歇斯底里的权力之争
Of a desperate grab for power,

513
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:00,092
而且失败了
And it has failed.

514
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:03,062
你输了  除非你想我去公开
You have failed,and unless you want me to go public

515
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:04,089
你还活着这个事实
With the fact that you are still alive,

516
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:07,066
快把你同伙的名字告诉我
You are gonna give me the names of the people that you've been working with.

517
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:08,093
-我  我没有  -我要名单
- I-I don't have them. - I want the names.

518
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,093
-我不知道  -名单
- I don't have any. - I want the names!

519
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,077
我真不知道
I don't know any!

520
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,017
好吧
Fine.

521
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:27,085
帮我接通华盛顿邮报的艾米
Patch me through to Amy at the washington post.

522
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:29,065
不要
No.

523
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:32,002
艾米  我是杰克  我需要发布一项声明
Amy,it's Jack. I have a statement I need to make.

524
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,025
等一下
Wait!

525
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:35,042
-等等  等下  -告诉我名字
- Wait! wait! wait! wait! - Give me the names!

526
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,052
我发誓  我发誓我不知道
I swear... I swear I don't have them.

527
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:39,059
整个计划都是匿名的
This whole project was... was based on anonymity.

528
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:40,099
我们从不亲自见面
We never met in person.

529
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:43,010
由中间人来处理一切事务  一个女人
Everything was handled through an intermediary,a woman.

530
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:44,046
她从未透露过身份
She never told me who she was.

531
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:45,063
从没说过她的名字
She never told me her name.

532
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,080
我也没有问
I never asked her.

533
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,043
和给你毒药的是同一人吗
The same woman that gave you the poison?

534
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,054
是的
Yes,yes.

535
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:02,025
艾米  不好意思  情况有变
Amy,I'm sorry. something's come up.

536
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:03,082
我晚点打给你
I've got to call you back.

537
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:08,002
随便你自己怎么说
You tell yourself whatever you want.

538
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,079
你是个卖国贼
You are a traitor.

539
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:12,099
你承诺过给我证人保护的
Witness protection was your promise.

540
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:14,093
是的
Yeah.

541
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:19,013
总统阁下  你听到了
Madam President,did you hear everything

542
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,060
霍奇斯的话吗
That Hodges had to say?

543
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:22,097
是的  他说的可信吗
Yes. Is any of it even credible?

544
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,080
很可信  生物监测器表明
All of it is. Biometric monitors here indicate

545
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,017
他没有撒谎
That he was telling the truth.

546
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:27,074
不管他们是谁  这个组织
Whoever they are,this group just went

547
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:29,011
为了拿到这个毒气罐
Through an awful lot of trouble

548
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:30,088
费了一番波折
To get their hands on that last canister.

549
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,051
很明显他们的计划仍在进行
It seems very clear to me that their plan is still on.

550
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:35,015
-你是说另一次攻击  -是的  阁下
- You mean another attack? - Yes,ma'am.

551
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:36,095
我认为您要假定他们会发动袭击
I think you should proceed under the assumption

552
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:38,005
并做好部署准备
That they might strike immediately.

553
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:39,022
等一下
Hold on.

554
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,065
霍奇斯说明年开始
Hodges said some Time next year.

555
00:24:40,072 --> 00:24:42,035
不  霍奇斯说那是以往的计划
No. Hodges said that was the plan.

556
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,092
照他这次制造的混乱来看
Given the chaos that he created today,

557
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:47,003
最明智的战略手段是马上行动
The smart strategic move would be to act right now.

558
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,016
现在  我觉得毒气罐仍旧在这个区域
Now,I believe the canister is still in this area,

559
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:50,066
我们得向国土安全局示警
So we're gonna have to alert Homeland,

560
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,016
让他们马上核实目标并进行搜捕
Have them start identifying and raiding targets.

561
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,047
霍奇斯说计划是要
Hodges said that the plan was

562
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:54,077
涉及到一些有恐怖主义倾向的组织
To enlist parties with terrorist ties.

563
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:57,040
这样看来  那会是我们的切入点
At this point,I think that might be our most solid lead.

564
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:58,094
总统阁下  我同意沃克探员说的
Madam President,I agree with agent Walker.

565
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,067
我们需要拟一份当前威胁评估
We need to make an immediate threat assessment

566
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:03,011
其中囊括所有已知的恐怖活动
With focus on all known terrorist activity.

567
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:05,008
我们获取消息的最快途径
The fastest way for us to get that information

568
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:07,008
是接入反恐组的服务器
Is to gain access to the CTU servers

569
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,081
迈尔参议员调查之后
That have been sealed as a result

570
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,048
那服务器就被封掉了
Of senator Mayer's investigation.

571
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:13,062
我马上下令重新启用
I'll have them recommissioned immediately.

572
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:15,055
以后政府的内部资源
And consider the resources of this government

573
00:25:15,062 --> 00:25:17,062
就归你自行支配了  杰克
At your disposal,Jack.

574
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:19,069
谢谢  总统阁下
Thank you,ma'am.

575
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,009
快准备好那些服务器
I need those servers right away.

576
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:23,003
他们在三楼的证据储物柜里
They're in doj evidence lockers on the third floor.

577
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,040
我让科技部的人去弄
I'll have I.T. break them out.

578
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:25,077
很好
Okay,good.

579
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,089
我们组新换了一班分析员
We have a new shift of analysts coming in,

580
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:29,099
你可以告诉他们你要找的
If you can tell them what you're looking for.

581
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:31,028
不行  没时间了
No,we don't have Time.

582
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,031
现在需要的是熟悉协议的人
We need someone who already knows the protocols.

583
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,027
我来处理
I'll take care of it.

584
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,094
给我那些服务器就行了
Just get me those servers.

585
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:54,013
谁
Who is it?

586
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,026
是我  杰克
Hey,it's me Jack.

587
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,026
杰克  你去哪了
Jack,where the hell are you?

588
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,080
联邦调查局总部
The FBI headquarters.

589
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:01,033
我一整晚都在试图联系你
I've been trying to reach you all night.

590
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,060
没人告诉我发生什么了
No one will tell me anything.

591
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:04,064
比尔真的出事了吗
Is it true about Bill?

592
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:08,087
是的
Yeah,I'm afraid so.

593
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:17,045
发生什么了
What happened?

594
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:20,012
他在围攻白宫时牺牲了
He was killed during the White House siege.

595
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:22,019
克罗伊  你要知道
Chloe,you should know,

596
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:25,002
比尔牺牲自己救了总统
Bill sacrificed his life to save the president.

597
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,057
听我说  威胁还没结束
Listen to me. This threat is not over.

598
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:32,029
我们觉得在这附近会有一次生化武器袭击
We believe that there's going to be a biological attack somewhere in the area.

599
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:33,090
很快  我需要你帮忙来阻止这次袭击
Soon. I need your help to stop it.

600
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:35,043
怎样做
How?

601
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,097
重组反恐小组的服务器
I need you to reconstitute the CTU servers.

602
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:40,064
反恐组解散后就被撤销了
They were seized when the CTU was decommissioned.

603
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:41,092
我没有权限查看
I don't have access to them.

604
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:43,021
你到这就会有了
You will by the Time you get here.

605
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:45,078
谁在做
Who's doing this?

606
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:47,035
我们没让全员参与
We don't have all the players.

607
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,098
等你赶到这  我再告诉你详情
I'll fill you in with as much as I know when you get here.

608
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:54,039
我派了车去旅馆接你
I'm sending a car over to your hotel.

609
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,073
派车过来吧
Send a car.

610
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:41,068
莫里斯  快醒醒
Morris,wake up.

611
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,061
什么  你怎么又跟我说话了
What? Are you speaking to me again now?

612
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,037
我要走了
I have to go.

613
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:46,063
你带普雷斯科特离开这个城市
I need you to take Prescott and get out of the city.

614
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,096
-为什么  -我刚和杰克通过电话
- Why? - I just spoke with Jack.

615
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,022
即将会有另一次袭击
There's going to be another attack.

616
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:51,008
这次是生化武器
This Time,it's biological.

617
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:53,051
既然这样  我们一起离开
Okay,then we'll all get out of here together.

618
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:55,061
我不能  调查局还需要我
I can't. FBI needs me.

619
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:58,018
可上一次你为那些人工作
But the last Time you worked for these people,

620
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:00,052
他们逮捕了你
They arrested you.

621
00:28:00,052 --> 00:28:01,066
我知道
I know.

622
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:03,039
可只有我才能让服务器重新上线
But I'm the only one that can get the servers back online.

623
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:05,079
我不会把你留在这里的
Well,I'm not gonna leave you here.

624
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:09,093
尤其这里还有被生化武器袭击的可能
Not with the possibility of a biological attack.

625
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,070
拜托了
Please.

626
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:20,051
我是唯一一个能办到这件事的人
I'm the only one that can do this.

627
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:22,024
杰克需要我
And Jack needs me.

628
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:25,078
我只想要你和雷斯科特都安全
And I just need for you and Prescott to be safe.

629
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:28,025
好吗
Okay?

630
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,045
回头家里见
I'll see you back at home.

631
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:34,015
你要多加小心
Just... be careful.

632
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,048
我会的
I will.

633
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:20,008
好了  我们开始前  每个人确保
All right,before we begin,everyone make sure

634
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,049
自己都获得了最新分组数据简报
You have your updated briefing packets,

635
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:23,017
以及疾控中心的调查摘要
And the latest CDC abstract.

636
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:26,020
-杰克  可以开始了  -谢谢
- Jack,whenever you're ready. - Thank you.

637
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:31,068
我知道今天你们很多人都失去了朋友同事
I know many of you have lost friends and colleagues today.

638
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,031
我也是
I have,too.

639
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,042
很不幸  现在不是哀悼
Unfortunately,the Time to mourn these brave men and women

640
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:37,068
这些勇士们的时候
Is going to have to wait.

641
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,079
因为你们都知道
'cause,as many of you are already aware,

642
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:42,019
我们的东海岸某处
We are facing the threat of a terrorist event

643
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:43,049
面临着恐怖袭击的威胁
Somewhere on the eastern seaboard.

644
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:44,096
我们并没有准确的情报
We don't have specific intel

645
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:46,029
告知这次袭击的时间
As to the Time table of this attack,

646
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,006
但是我们有理由相信
But we do have reason to believe that

647
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:49,057
袭击的幕后主使会计划立即发动袭击
The people that are behind this will want to strike immediately?

648
00:29:49,057 --> 00:29:50,078
打扰一下
Excuse me.

649
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:53,008
我是蒂姆·莫兰  外勤探员
Tim Moran,field ops.

650
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:54,088
幕后主使是谁
Who are the people behind this?

651
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:57,028
目前为止  我们只有2名嫌疑人
Right now,we only have two confirmed suspects.

652
00:29:58,052 --> 00:29:59,062
托尼·阿尔梅达
Tony Almeida

653
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:01,035
还有和他合作的那个女人
And the woman he's been working with.

654
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,089
我们还在核实她的身份
We're still trying to identify her.

655
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:05,062
我们假定  他俩是更大阴谋的一部分
The assumption is,the two of them are part of a broader

656
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,056
这些请参见各位手中的简报资料
Conspiracy as outlined in your briefing material.

657
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:09,013
是什么性质的袭击呢
And the nature of the attack?

658
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,073
资料上说是生化武器
All it says here is biological.

659
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,040
病原体实际上是一种朊病毒的变体
The actual pathogen is a prion variant,designed to attack

660
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:15,060
用来摧毁中枢神经系统
The central nervous system and ulTimately destroy it.

661
00:30:15,067 --> 00:30:17,003
我们知道目标吗
Do we know what the target is?

662
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,064
不  我们还不清楚运载装置的具体细节
No,not yet. We're also unclear on the specifics of the delivery device.

663
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,005
那我们目前知道什么
Well,what leads do we have?

664
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:23,001
现在
Right now,

665
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:25,011
我们只能凭经验判断
We are solely working off an operational theory

666
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:26,088
那些幕后主使们
That the people that are behind this

667
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:28,014
需要伪造证据
Will need to manufacture evidence

668
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:30,018
来把这次袭击嫁祸到
In an effort to offload the blame for this attack

669
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:31,061
其它有恐怖主义倾向的
To either another group or an individual

670
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:32,078
组织或是个人身上
With terrorist sympathies.

671
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:34,012
以此来造成公众恐慌
During the ensuing panic,

672
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:36,025
这些人就能以维持时局稳定
These people will move in and seize power

673
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,022
为借口介入  进而夺取政权
Under the guise of creating and maintaining stability.

674
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:41,062
所以  我们现在的任务就是
So,our job here is to look for traces

675
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:43,068
寻找伪造证据的蛛丝马迹
Of that manufactured evidence.

676
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:44,050
怎么找
How exactly?

677
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,073
搜索那些可疑的财政交易
Pattern searches of suspicious financial transactions.

678
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,007
窃听器的密码截取
Keyword intercepts of existing wiretaps,

679
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,023
包括网站和电子邮件
Websites and e-mails.

680
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,040
以及过去6个月里
And data-mining all

681
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:53,017
国家安全局和中央情报局
NSA and CIA intelligence

682
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:55,054
所截获的有关伊斯兰圣战主义活动的情报
On jihadist activities over the past six months.

683
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,016
打扰一下
Excuse me.

684
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:59,038
如此大规模的监控不仅违法
Not only is that type of blanket surveillance illegal.

685
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:01,001
我们也没有能力办到
We don't have the capacity to pull it off.

686
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,018
这样的搜索方式
The search algorithms

687
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:04,031
-并不存在  -不  是有的
- Simply don't exist.- yes,they do.

688
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:06,005
-在反恐组  -那些服务器已被撤销了
- At CTU. - Those servers were decommissioned.

689
00:31:06,012 --> 00:31:08,001
现在不再这样了  它们在这
Not anymore. They're here.

690
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,025
我们马上可以安装恢复
We're in the process of installing them now.

691
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:13,001
那我们算什么  反恐小组精简版吗
Well,what does that make us,CTU-lite?

692
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,013
据我所知
Last I heard,

693
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:17,086
调查局是受联邦法令约束的政府部门
The bureau was a federal entity bound by federal statute.

694
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:20,005
詹尼斯  照做  要不我找其他愿做的来
Janis, do this or I will find someone else who will.

695
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,012
我没时间跟你争论
I do not have Time to argue.

696
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,075
我不是在争论  我只是在问

697
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:24,029
继续
Moving on.

698
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,059
由我来接待她就行了  谢谢

699
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:33,046
杰克

谢谢你能来
Thanks for coming.

701
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:39,057
你脸色好差
You look like hell.

702
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,014
-你没事吧  -我没事
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

703
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,030
你看起来可不是这样
You don't look fine.

704
00:31:42,037 --> 00:31:43,047
也许有点累
Maybe a little tired.

705
00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:44,037
收到我发给你的报告了吗
Did you get the report I sent you?

706
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,018
收到了  我在过来的路上看过了
Yeah. I read it on the way over.

707
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:48,098
-太可怕了  可信度高吗  -很高
- It's terrifying. How real is this? - Real.

708
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:51,048
我们能访问反恐组的服务器了  对吧
We're getting access to the CTU servers, right?

709
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:52,078
没错  已经连线了
Yeah. They're coming online now.

710
00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:54,008
我不是应该对这进行监控吗
Shouldn't I be supervising this?

711
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:55,035
是的  听着
Yeah. Look,

712
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:58,032
在我们开始前  我得跟你说点事
There's something I need to talk to you about before we get started.

713
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:01,032
这真让我难以启齿
There's no easy way for me to say this.

714
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,003
托尼要对这些袭击事件负责
But Tony's been responsible for these attacks.

715
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,020
那不可能
That's not possible.

716
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,020
他一直在利用你跟比尔
He was using you and Bill all along.

717
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,017
他一直在为一些私人军工企业做事
He's really been working for a group of private military firms

718
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:15,024
企图破坏国家稳定  夺取政权
Trying to destabilize this country in an effort to seize power.

719
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:16,064
到目前为止

720
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:19,028
他今天的行为已经造成上百人丧生
His actions have cost the lives of hundreds of people.

721
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:20,094
还威胁着更多人的生命
But he's threatening thousands more.

722
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,098
这真没道理啊
It doesn't make any sense.

723
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:25,068
我知道他因为米歇尔的死痛不欲生  但
I know he was devastated over michelle, but...

724
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,038
克罗伊  他不是你的朋友
Chloe, he's not your friend.

725
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,082
你认识的那个托尼  已经不存在了
The Tony that you knew... he doesn't exist anymore.

726
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:32,039
他一定有什么苦衷
There has to be a reason.

727
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,086
什么苦衷
A reason for what?

728
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:35,086
让两辆客机坠毁
Bringing down two passenger planes?

729
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:38,053
偷袭25名联邦探员
Trying to ambush 25 federal agents?

730
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,083
克罗伊  他想杀了我
Chloe, he tried to kill me.

731
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,047
他背叛了我们所有人  你  我
He betrayed us all... you, me,

732
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:48,047
还有比尔
And Bill,

733
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:50,084
现在我们唯一的责任
And right now our only responsibility

734
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:51,097
就是要阻止他
Is to stop him.

735
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,018
我需要知道你能够把他当做敌人
Now, I need to know that you can treat him

736
00:32:54,024 --> 00:32:57,008
你能跟我一起来阻止他
As an enemy combatant, that you are with me on this.

737
00:32:57,015 --> 00:33:00,022
好吧  你说做什么我就做
Okay, I'll do whatever you say.

738
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:05,019
不  我要知道你在这件事上跟我是一致的
No, I need to know that you are with me on this.

739
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,023
我跟你是一致的
I'm with you.

740
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:12,066
好吧
Okay.

741
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,073
走吧
Let's go.

742
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:28,095
他叫吉布安·阿尔扎利安
His name is jibraan al-zarian.

743
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,078
27岁

744
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:33,072
他是卡布罗拉花岗岩建筑厂的散工
He's a day laborer at cabrera granite construction.

745
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,092
移民情况呢
Immigration status?

746
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,092
非法
Illegal.

747
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:38,032
他的签证一月就到期了
His visa expired as of january.

748
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,092
跟极端主义团体有联系吗
Ties to any extremist groups?

749
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:42,079
没有任何联系  但他心里一定有怨愤
No, none, but there's definitely anger there.

750
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:45,013
在巴基斯坦边境一次美军空袭中父母双亡
Both parents were killed in a U.S. Air strike by the PakistanI border.

751
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,070
他当时只有11岁
He was 11 at the Time.

752
00:33:47,077 --> 00:33:50,020
符合犯罪心理特征

753
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:53,037
有点自闭  不为同事所熟悉
Bit of a loner, a mystery to his coworkers,

754
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:54,080
我们编造了剩下的行为模式
And we build the rest.

755
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:56,061
家人呢
What about the family?

756
00:33:56,067 --> 00:34:00,038
有一个弟弟  差不多是他独自抚养的
One younger brother, who he's pretty much raised on his own.

757
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:01,044
很完美  对吧
It's perfect, huh?

758
00:34:03,015 --> 00:34:06,012
尽管还不知道今晚首府人民能否睡个好觉
Though it is doubtful that anyone sleeps very well in D.C. tonight,

759
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:09,092
经历了今天一轮恐怖袭击后
A certain calm was set over the streets.

760
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:12,035
全国人民都很害怕
After an unprecedented series of terror attacks

761
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:16,026
但人民的情绪已经稍稍缓和了
Left people all over the country shaken and demavery hungry.

762
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,056
在泰勒总统讲话里

763
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:20,056
早上好

764
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:22,056
倒点橘子水喝吧
Pour yourself some orange juice.

765
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:26,080
我不是很饿

766
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:29,041
坐下  吃一次早饭吧
Sit down,eat some breakfast for once.

767
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,091
不吃不利于身体健康
It's unhealthy not to.

768
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:32,024
你起来干嘛
What are you doing up anyway?

769
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:33,024
我
I,uh,

770
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,044
睡不着
Couldn't sleep.

771

听着  今天一下班
Listen,uh,I want you to come

772
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:40,032
就赶紧回家

773
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:42,015
好吗
Okay?

774
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:44,012
不要耽搁
No delaying.

775
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:45,012
为什么
Why?

776
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:47,032
以防万一
Just in case.

777
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,099
防什么
In case of what?

778
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:51,086
袭击啊  恐怖分子啊
These attacks,this terrorism...

779
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:53,003
新闻里全是这些
It's all over the news.

780
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:56,050
我们穆斯林今天没好日子过
Okay,it's not a good day to be a muslim.

781
00:34:56,057 --> 00:34:59,060
吉布安  穆斯林和这些无关
Jibraan,muslims had nothing to do with it.

782
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,047
这点无关紧要
Doesn't matter.

783
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:03,091
相信我  没人在乎这个
Nobody cares,believe me.

784
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:06,098
很多同事还以为我是波多黎各人
Most of the guys at my work think I'm puerto rican anyway.

785
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:13,075
到时间了
It's about Time.

786
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,026
请进
Come in.

787
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:46,089
打扰一下  泰勒小姐
Excuse me,Ms. Taylor.

788
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:48,020
什么事
What is it?

789
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:50,087
司法部长让我提醒你
The attorney general asked me to check in with you.

790
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:52,090
他在等着签署你
He is waiting to sign off on a document

791
00:35:52,097 --> 00:35:55,054
正在看的文件
I was told you were reviewing.

792
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,094
有人跟你说过
Anyone happen to mention to you

793
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,061
这文件内容吗
What this document is about?

794
00:35:58,067 --> 00:35:59,061
没有
No,ma'am.

795
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:02,051
我觉得他们也不会
No,I imagine they wouldn't.

796
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:05,080
这是高度机密
It's a secret,Highly classified.

797
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,075
我可不在乎
Not that I give a damn.

798
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,082
这是让乔纳斯·霍奇斯可以
It's a get-out- of-jail-free card

799
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:13,015
大摇大摆走出监狱的绿色通道
For Jonas Hodges,

800
00:36:13,022 --> 00:36:17,019
那个杀了我弟弟
The bastard responsible for my brother's death

801
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:18,093
和许多平民的混蛋
And so many others.

802
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:21,036
我不明白
I don't understand.

803
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:24,023
霍奇斯先生死在医院里了
Mr. Hodges died in the hospital.

804
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,084
真是这样就好了  但事实是他没死
I wish that were the case,but no,

805
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,040
一旦司法部长签署了证人保护文件
And once the A.G. Signs this witness protection agreement,

806
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:33,072
霍奇斯就会舒舒服服地
Hodges is going to live out his days

807
00:36:33,072 --> 00:36:35,094
在隐姓埋名中继续过他的日子去了
in comfort and anonymity

808
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:39,088
而我弟弟却躺在阿林顿墓地死不瞑目
While my brother lies in his grave in Arlington Cemetery.

809
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:44,062
亚伦  你说这公平吗
Does that sound like justice to you,Aaron?

810
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:47,096
不  女士  不公平
No,ma'am,it does not.

811
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:49,079
但我妈却认同
And yet my mother saw fit

812
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:52,049
以奖励这个混蛋来换取他的合作的做法
To reward this monster for his cooperation.

813
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:55,026
我认为那对总统来说
Well,I'm sure it was a difficult decision

814
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,070
也是个艰难的决定
For the president to make.

815
00:36:56,077 --> 00:36:58,059
没有你想象中的难
Not difficult enough.

816
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:01,056
我妈也许可以忍受  但我不能
My mother may be able to live with it, but I'm not sure I can.

817
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:07,003
泰勒女士  这种情况的豁免
Ms. Taylor,I have seen the guilty

818
00:37:07,003 --> 00:37:09,061
不是一次两次了
walk free many Times.

819
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:12,031
我理解你的愤怒和挫败感
I understand your anger and frustration,

820
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:14,072
我也真的很难过
And I am genuinely sorry.

821
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:23,099
告诉司法部长文件我看过了
Tell the A.G. I've reviewed the agreement

822
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,096
可以继续
And we can move ahead.

823
00:37:26,003 --> 00:37:28,053
谢谢
Thank you,ma'am.

824
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:33,057
有什么我可以为你做的吗
Is there anything else that I can do for you?

825
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:36,054
除了把乔纳斯·霍奇斯杀了  没有了
Other than kill Jonas Hodges,no.

826
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:45,001
对不起  亚伦
I'm sorry,Aaron.

827
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:46,028
我不是这个意思
I didn't mean that.

828
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:48,005
只是发泄一下
I was just venting.

829
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:51,045
女士  失陪
Ma'am.

830
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:26,065
你好
Hello?

831
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,076
马丁
Martin?

832
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,016
我是奥利维亚·泰勒
It's Olivia Taylor.

833
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,007
吵醒你了吗
Did I wake you?

834
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:32,051

我还以为你不会在家呢

838
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:37,034
还以为你在佛罗里达

反对加纳的竞选

841
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,085
为什么
Why not?

842
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:46,055
只是从政界高官的偏好来看
Let's just say that my methods were a little hardball

843
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:48,076
我的手段有点太强硬了
For the governor's taste.

844
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,080

Really impressive.

848
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:04,010

She continues to surprise,doesn't she?

849

马丁  我需要你帮忙

电话上不方便讲

这三更半夜的

你总要说清楚点
Y-you got to do better than that.

856
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:23,079
在亚特兰大时  咱选了海沃斯做竞选伙伴
We were in a dive hotel bar in Atlanta Right after we picked Hayworth

857
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:25,073
随后咱去了酒店的潜水酒吧
To be the running mate on the ticket.

858
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,044
他滥用处方药的事情
There was an issue regarding his abuse of a certain prescription drug

859
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:33,023
当地媒体执意抓着不放
And a local reporter who couldn't be persuaded to shut up about it.

860
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:37,077

是不能解决或消灭的

863

我当时醉了
Well,I was drunk.

864
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:49,022
你是认真的
You were serious.

865
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:51,079
好吧
You know,you're right.

866
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:53,082
我们是不能在电话里讨论这个
We shouldn't be talking about this over the phone.

867
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:56,002
你什么时候能到白宫

不要用2号服务器启动子网络
Oh,you don't want to boot the subnet with server two.

那有一个错误还没来及修正
It has a faulty bus that we weren't able to fix

874
00:40:13,074 --> 00:40:14,081
就被你们扣押了
Before you guys impounded it.

875
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:16,061
要不你来接手吧
Well,maybe you'd like to take over.

876
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:19,058
只要能让它正常运转就好
Only if you want it to work right.

877
00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:22,058
我也不喜欢这个
I don't like this either.

我真不想干这个

我同意了  但并不喜欢
I agreed to it,but I don't like it.

你不喜欢什么啊
What exactly aren't you comfortable with?

882
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:32,059
首先这违反了人权法案
Uh,well,the Bill of Rights being violated,for one,

883
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:33,083
所以  如果你要做一些

听着  如果你觉得你的抱怨
Look,if you think your need

889
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:58,009
比那些依靠我们保护的生命
To complain is more important than the lives of the people

890
00:40:58,015 --> 00:41:00,045
更重要的话  到别处抱怨去吧你
That are counting on us,go whine somewhere else!

891
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:02,033
-杰克  没关系的  -不 很有关系
- Jack, it's okey. - No, it's not okey.

大卫·帕默总统重新启用这些服务器
President David Palmer recommissioned these servers

893
00:41:05,056 --> 00:41:07,076
是因为他认为这对国家安全很重要

帕默总统已经做了决定

他出什么问题了
There's something really wrong with him.

899
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,036
他说帕默总统
He said president Palmer.

900
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,006
其实他的意思是泰勒
He meant Taylor.

还说了两次
He said it twice.

你尽量多吃点
Here,you do what you can to finish up.

905
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,034
我去看看电表箱
