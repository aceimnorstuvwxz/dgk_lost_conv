把手机收起来
Put the phone away.

00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:32,011
你五分钟之前就这么说的
That's what you said five minutes ago.

00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:34,054
-爸爸  -宝贝
Dad... I got you the phone

9
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:35,078
手机是让你有急事时用的

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,059
这就是急事啊
Well, this is an emergency.

00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:40,006

等等  那你怎么就可以用电话
Wait, now, how come you get to talk on the phone?

13
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:45,036
这不公平
That's not fair.

14
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:46,066
生活总是不公平的
Life's not fair.

15
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:48,022
喂
Hello.

16
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:49,069
喂

Go! get in there!

31
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,039
-爸爸  -我们走
We gonna go.

32
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,002
我们走
Let's go!

33
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,023
请不要伤害我女儿
Please don't hurt my daughter.

34
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:53,022
我有钱
I've got money.

35
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:55,079
我们不要你的钱  拉森先生
We don't want your money, Mr.Latham.

36
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,057
我们只想让你帮我们修点东西
We just need you to fix something for us.

37
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:11,054
按时间表  今天是第三天的
For the record chart, this is the third day

38
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:12,091
参议员听证会
Of this senate hearing

39
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:14,081
调查最近被撤销的反恐小组
Investigating human rights violations

40
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:18,015
暴力侵权的案件
By the recently disbanded Counter Terrorist Unit.

41
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,005
昨天当我们休庭的时候
Yesterday, when we adjourned,

42
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,025
我们讨论过反恐小组探员
We were discussing brutality and torture

43
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:27,083
行动过程中的野蛮行径和刑讯逼供
By CTU agents in the course of their operations.

44
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,084
证人  请亮明身份
Will the witness please state his name?

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,039
杰克·鲍尔
Jack Bauer.

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,089
鲍尔先生  我没看到你的律师到场
Mr.Bauer. I don't see your counsel present.

47
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,039
他或她不知道我们要开始了吗
Is he or she not aware that we're about to start?

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,057
我已经选择不要律师
I've chosen not to retain counsel.

49
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:47,013
鲍尔先生  我得提醒你
Mr.Bauer, I have to advise you

50
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:48,067
我们要呈现在你面前
That many of the questions

51
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:51,071
诸多事件的法律性质
That we're about to appose to you are of a legal nature

52
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:54,027
所导致的后果  可能会对你不利
might result in answers that could incriminate you.

53
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:56,031
这个我懂  参议员
I understand that, senator.

54
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:58,064
我们可以把你的出证时间推迟到下午
We can postpone your testimony until this afternoon

55
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,051
如果你想找个律师的话
If you'd like to bring in representation

56
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:03,085
这也是我强烈建议的
Something that I would strongly advise.

57
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:07,003
第一个问题是什么  参议员
What is the first question, senator?

58
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,006
那好吧
All right, then.

59
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:13,026
我们开始
Let's begin.

60
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:17,097
鲍尔先生  亚伯拉罕·哈达德是什么人
Mr.Bauer. Who is Abraham Haddad?

61
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,030
这是机密
That information is classified.

62
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:24,064
我们代表全美国的民众
We represent the people of the united states,

63
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:27,077
把这些文件列为非机密了
and we have declassified those files on their behalf.

64
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:30,038
现在我再问你一次
Now I'm going to ask you one more time.

65
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,069
亚伯拉罕·哈达德是什么人
Who is Abraham Haddad?

66
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,088
他曾经是恐怖组织间谍中的一员
He was a member of the terrorist sleeper cell.

67
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:41,035
2002年反恐小组开始对其监控
CTU had him under surveillance in 2002.

68
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:44,062
你是否在没履行程序的情况下
And is it true that you detained Mr.Haddad

69
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:46,063
就扣留了哈达德先生
Without due process,

70
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:48,063
并对他使用过
And that you used

71
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:51,016
极端的审讯手段
Extreme interrogation methods on him

72
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:54,027
直至他回答了你的问题
Until he answered your questions?

73
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:55,090
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

74
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,014
你承认在审讯期间
Would you say that you broke procedure

75
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:59,081
破坏了程序吗
With this interrogation?

76
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:01,001
也许吧
Probably.

77
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:03,071
也许吧
Probably?

78
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:07,008
好一个轻描淡写的回答
Well, that's a... very cavalier answer.

79
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:10,013
看来你对你的行为并无悔意
You don't seem to care about the implications here.

80
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:15,032
你的回答是什么  鲍尔先生
Well, Mr. Bauer?

81
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,076
对不起  参议员
I'm sorry, senator.

82
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,062
我没明白你的问题
I didn't hear a question.

83
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:21,033
那好
All right, then.

84
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:25,050
你是否虐待过哈达德先生
Did you torture Mr. Haddad?

85
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,010
如果按照日内瓦公约
According to the definitions

86
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,000
的定义来说
Set forth by the geneva convention,

87
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,065
是的
Yes, I did.

88
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:34,044
参议员  让我猜猜你的想法
Senator, why don't I save you some time.

89
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:37,008
你是想借此牵连反恐小组
It's obvious that your agenda is to discredit CTU

90
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,055
然后酝酿出一套理论来
And generate a series of indictments...

91
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:42,018
我唯一的目的就是找出真相
My only agenda is to get to the truth.

92
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,082
我不这么认为  先生
I don't think it is, sir.

93
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,058
你说什么
Excuse me?

94
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:48,079
亚伯拉罕·哈达德计划袭击载有45人的客车
Abraham Haddad had targeted a bus carrying 45 people,

95
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,079
其中有10名乘客是儿童
Ten of which were children.

96
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,016
参议员  事实是我成功阻止了这次袭击
The truth, senator, is I stopped that attack from happening.

97
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:55,066
通过严刑拷打哈达德这种手段
By torturing Mr. haddad.

98
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,067
通过使用我认为必要的手段
By doing what I deem necessary

99
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,083
来保护无辜的生命
to protect innocent lives.

100
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:01,060
因此鲍尔先生  你的理论就是
So basically what you are saying, Mr. Bauer,

101
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,080
为达目的不择手段
is that the ends justified the means，

102
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,067
并且可以凌驾于法律之上
and that you are above the law.

103
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:07,001
每次我临危受命
When I am activated,

104
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,084
介入调查  都只有一个目的
When I am brought into a situation, there is a reason.

105
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:11,008
目的就是要不惜一切代价
And that reason is to complete the objectives

106
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,008
完成任务
Of my mission at all costs.

107
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:15,038
即便是要违反法律吗
Even if it means breaking the law?

108
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,078
对于战士来说
For a combat soldier,

109
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,009
成败的关键就在于
The difference between success and failure

110
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,092
能否因敌制宜
Is your ability to adapt to your enemy.

111
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:23,046
我的敌人
The people that I deal with,

112
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:25,002
他们不在乎你的规则
they don't care about your rules.

113
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:27,023
他们只在乎结果
All they care about is a result.

114
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:30,073
我的使命就是 阻止他们达到目的
My job is to stop them from accomplishing their objectives.

115
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:32,090
我只是以其人之道还治其人之身
I simply adapted.

116
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:34,047
对于您的问题
In answer to your question,

117
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:35,090
我是否凌驾于法律之上
Am I above the law?

118
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:37,027
回答是  是的
No, sir.

119
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:41,054
我更乐于被 您所代表的广大人民来评判
I am more than willing to be judged By the people you claim to represent.

120
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:44,044
并由他们来决定我的命运
I will let them decide what price I should pay.

121
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:47,085
但请你别坐那儿摆出一副同情的样子
But please do not sit there with that smug look on your face

122
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:50,088
还期待我会为自己所做的决定而后悔
And expect me to regret the decisions that I have made,

123
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,089
而事实是
Because, sir, the truth is,

124
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,092
我不后悔
I don't.

125
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:57,003
打扰一下  先生
Excuse me, sir.

126
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:13,027
抱歉打扰了  参议员先生
Sorry for interrupting, senator.

127
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:14,061
我是联邦调查局的蕾妮·沃克
I'm Renee Walker with the FBI.

128
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:16,044
这有一张杰克·鲍尔的传票
We've a subpena for Jack Bauer.

129
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:19,068
我需要您立即 将他转交于我羁押
I need him remanded Into my custody immediately.

130
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,028
我对你的传票
I'm not surprised that anyone has a subpoena

131
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,002
并不怀疑
Mr. Bauer, but right now,

132
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:25,099
但你现在只能等着
You're going to have to wait your turn.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,092
他正在接受美国参议院的审问
He's being questioned by the united states senate.

134
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:30,070
先生  我们现在就需要鲍尔先生
Sir, we need Mr. Bauer immediately.

135
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:42,064
看来  我们只能放你走了
Well, apparently we're going to have to let you go

136
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:45,031
暂时离开
For now,

137
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:46,094
但对你的审讯还没结束
But we're not done with you.

138
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:48,077
我们明早
We'll reconvene with you

139
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:50,038
同一时间继续
Tomorrow morning at the same time.

140
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,058
你明白吗
Is that understood?

141
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,078
明白
Yes, sir.

142
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,029
你可以跟这些探员走了
All right. then you go along with these agents.

143
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,007
我们继续
Well, let's proceed.

144
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:14,087
警卫  传唤下一位证人
Bailiff, call the next witness.

145
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:16,060
这是怎么回事
What is this about?

146
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,034
鲍尔先生  我是沃克探员

147
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:19,057
这位是泰勒探员

148
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:22,018
我需要你随我们去一趟办公室
We need you to come with us to our office.

149
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,004
就在街口不远处
It's just down the block.

150
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,069
到了就会告诉你的
You'll be briefed when we get there.

151
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:30,052
你好
Hello?

152
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,058
詹尼斯  是我  拉里在哪
Janis, it's me. where's Larry?

153
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,062
他在给多曼的小组做简报
He's briefing Dornan's group.

154
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:35,096
告诉他我接到鲍尔了  我们马上出发
Tell him I got Bauer. We are leaving here now.

155
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:38,012
那太好了  不过情况又恶化了
Oh, that's good cause the situation is heating up.

156
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:39,026
怎么了
What are you talking about?

157
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:40,063
我们追踪的那伙人
That crew we've been tracking?

158
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:43,030
他们刚刚绑架了一个叫迈克尔·拉森
They just grabbed a man named Michael Latham.

159
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:46,060
拉森  他是国安局防火墙系统的工作人员
Latham? he worked on homeland's firewall project.

160
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:48,057
他可不只是个员工
Oh, he didn't just work on it, he designed it.

161
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:50,050
他不仅在那工作  而且设计了这个系统
He's the chief engineer of the government's

162
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:52,017
他是政府基础设施安全体系的首席工程师
Infrastructure security system.

163
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,045
好吧  我马上到
All right, I'll be there soon.

164
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,088
你帮鲍尔取消安检了吗
Did you get Bauer cleared through security yet?

165
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,085
-还没呢  -蕾妮正他带过来
Not yet. well, Renee's bringing him in.

166
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,042
几分钟后就到了
There's only a couple of minutes out.

167
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:05,035
几分钟可搞不定
Then you won't need him cleared for a couple of minutes.

168
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:08,019
肖恩  作为朋友  我想给你一些
Shawn, as a friend, I'd like to give you some...

169
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,099
你不是我的朋友
You're not my friend.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,086
好吧  作为一个将要成为
Sure. as someone is close to a friend

171
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:14,096
你的朋友的人  想给你点建议
that you are ever going to get, let me give you some advice.

172
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:17,080
大多数人都不喜欢被挖苦
Most people don't like sarcasm.

173
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:20,040
我倒是不介意  因为我很开朗
I myself have no problem with it, 'cause I'm cheerful.

174
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,087
我是个乐观的人
I'm a cheerful person.

175
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:24,047
你是一个乐观的人吗
You're a cheerful person?

176
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:27,045
快点帮鲍尔取消安检
Just get Bauer cleared.

177
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,001
在过去的八周
For the past eight weeks,

178
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:31,088
这家事务所一直在调查
This office has been investigating

179
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,021
一系列的技术盗窃案
a series Of technology thefts

180
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:37,005
关于软件  用户门阵列芯片和神经网络
Software, custom gate array chips, neural networks.

181
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,048
鉴证科推断这次入侵
Forensics concluded that the break-ins

182
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,005
是同一伙人干的
were the work of the same crew,

183
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:42,052
但我们不知道他们何时罢休
But we didn't know what their end game was

184
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:44,076
直到目前
Until now.

185
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:46,056
这是迈克尔·拉森
This is Michael Latham.

186
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,036
国家机密设施及
The chief engineer

187
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:51,016
防火墙工程的
On the classified infrastructure portal,

188
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:52,077
首席工程师
Homeland's firewall project.

189
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:54,053
十分钟前他被绑架了
He was abducted ten minutes ago

190
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:56,060
也是那个技术盗窃团伙干的
By the same group behind the technology thefts.

191
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,060
你认为他们正利用拉森
You think they're using this guy latham

192
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,074
-来突破CIP防火墙吗  -那正是我担心的
To get through the cip firewall? That's I concerned.

193
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:01,091
他们偷盗的设备正好可以被用来
The hardware they stole could be used

194
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:03,028
制作突破防火墙的装置
To build a device to do just that.

195
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:05,011
而拉森正是能做到的几个人之一
and Latham is one of the few people that can do it.

196
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,088
我们猜想他正被迫制作此装置
We assume he's being forced to work on the device,

197
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,045
或者他已经死了
Or that he's already dead.

198
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:12,005
打扰一下  蕾妮把杰克·鲍尔带来了
Excuse me. Renee is on the way in with Jack Bauer.

199

204
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:31,027

205
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,021
通信系统  导航系统
Communications, navigation...

206
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:36,001
但我们还需要控制其他的系统
But we need the other systems working.

207
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:37,082
去看下拉森的进展

纽约的天气为多云

所以旅程中我们可能会遇到乱流

229
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:11,087

00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,004
能协助我们进行调查

Well, lucky for me, I'm not here to apply for a job, agent moss.

你看过他的档案
You've read his file.

242
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:45,077
你一不小心说错话
Bauer's the kind of guy

243
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:47,047
鲍尔这人就会发飙
You say the wrong thing, he can go off.

244
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:49,062
放心吧  拉里
I'll be fine, larry.

245
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:53,025
要是他发飙了  我会叫你的

鲍尔已经被起诉了吗

00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:35,035
还没  不过参议院听证会后就要开始

CIP防火墙保护着我国所有的基础设施系统

电信业  交通运输业  电力系统

都将处于危险之中

264
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,010
沃克探员  对吧

265
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:47,003

我已经离职了
I'm not active.

267
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:51,020
司法部要对我提起刑事诉讼
The DOJ is about to file criminal charges against me.

268
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,024
对于你现在的情况
I'm not exactly in a position

269
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:55,037
我是爱莫能助

270
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:58,018
尽管我知道事态严峻

不  我认为你不了解

这次危机的幕后主使之一
One of the men behind this threat

273
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,046
是你的一个老熟人

274
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:30,038
这不可能
That's not possible.

托尼·阿尔梅达已经死了
Tony Almedia is dead.

276
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,041
很明显  他没死

00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,005
他就死在了我的面前
I was there when he died.

278

从那以后你就再没见过他
You never saw him after that

280
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:41,045
而几小时后

281
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,077
你就被中国政府带走了

00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:53,003

要是托尼还活着  我一定会知道的
If Tony were still alive, I would know.

285
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:56,060
他会跟我联系的
He will contact me.

286
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:58,040
我们从盗窃案发生地点的
We recovered this image from a security camera

287
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,004
一个摄像机中恢复了这张图片

288
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,085
有时间和日期的标注
It's time stamped and dated.

289
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:08,071
图像可能是伪造的
Images can be manipulated.

290
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,042
这张肯定不是
Not this one.

291
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,096
抱歉  我不相信
I'm sorry, I don't believe it.

292
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,040
我挖开了阿尔梅达的坟墓
I had Almedia's grave exhumed.

293
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:28,017
DNA检验证明
DNA test confirmed that

294
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:31,097
里面埋的不是他的尸体
it was not his body that was buried.

295
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:34,031
证据就在这里
The evidence is right here.

296
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:35,067
要是你对它视而不见
If you want to leave

297
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:39,085
就这么走的话  随便你
without looking at it, go ahead.

298
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:07,047
GSA117号航班上路了

299

Have a good day.

305
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:46,061
出什么问题了
What's the problem?

306
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:49,095
CIP模块不工作了
The CIP module stoped working.

307
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:52,002
不工作了  什么意思
What do you mean it stopped?

308
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,090
它相位失调了
It keeps going out of phase.

309
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,002
拉森不是说没问题了吗
I thought Latham said it was good to go.

310
00:15:58,003 --> 00:15:59,086
可是  还有问题
Well, it's not.

311
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:02,014
好吧  拿给我
All right, let me have it.

312
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:22,015
你动什么手脚了
So what did you do?

313
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:25,012
我什么也没做
I didn't do anything.

314
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:26,045
我发誓
I swear.

315
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:28,015
那为什么它不工作了
Then why isn't it working?

316
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:30,026
我不知道
I don't know.

317
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,009
修好它
Fix it.

318
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,070
马上
Now.

319
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,084
你最好再快一点
You're gonna want to move faster than that.

320
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,044
几分钟内
See, 'cause if you can't make this work

321
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:48,044
要是你修不好
In the next few minutes,

322
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,058
我就不需要你了
I won't need you anymore.

323
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:53,055
懂我的意思吗
You understand what that means?

324
00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:55,055
很好
Good.

325
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,036
修好它
Now fix it.

326
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,013
官方估计大约有30万平民
Officials say that an estimated 300,000 civilians

327
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:19,076
男人  女人和儿童
Men, women, and children--

328
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:23,047
都在本杰明·朱玛将军的种族清洗中
Have been killed as part of general Benjamin Juma's

329
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:26,020
惨遭杀害

330
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,040
位于非洲的桑加拉的幸存者
Survivors in the African nation of Sangala,

331
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,027
相信美方进行干涉
Believe American intervention

332
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:32,067
以避免更多的伤亡是必要的
Is necessary to prevent further bloodshed.

333
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:35,014
目前白宫还未对此事公开表态
The white house has made no public statements...

334
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:38,015
朱玛是自卢旺达大屠杀后
Juma's perpetrating the worst mass murder

335
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,015
又一非洲暴君
Africa has seen since rwanda.

336
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,025
但如果你读报上的专栏评论
But if you read the columns...

337
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,042
我知道
I do.

338
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:44,045
半数人反对我们采取行动
Half of them are against our taking action.

339
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,089
但如果我们无动于衷
But if we don't...

340
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,099
六个月以后  这帮人又会
Six months from now, those same members of the press

341
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,006
出来指责我们道德沦丧
Will be accusing us of moral bankruptcy.

342
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:53,030
我们可以重新考虑通过联合国采取行动
We can always revisit the un option.

343
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,050
伊桑  联合国已形同虚设
The UN's paralyzed, ethan,

344
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:58,033
眼睁睁看着那个疯子屠杀民众
While people are being butchered by that madman.

345
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:00,034
我们必须担起责任来
We have to lead.

346
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:03,014
即便是我们单枪匹马也再所不惜
Even if it means going it alone.

347
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,001
我不会昧着良心眼睁睁看着
I'm not gonna have hundreds

348
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,048
这么多无辜生命受难
Of thousands of lives on my conscience.

349
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,068
朱玛将军
General Juma

350
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:11,041
-必须被铲除  -只要您一声令下
-has to be stopped. - He will be,

351
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,045
总统阁下
Madame president.

352
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:13,088
这事不难
As soon as you give the order.

353
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:16,025
参谋长联席会议的人都到齐了吗
Are the joint chiefs here yet?

354
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,025
他们都在战略情报室
They're gathering in the situation room.

355
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:20,012
准备好后他们会通知我们的
They'll call as soon as they're ready for you.

356
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,029
我刚听说
I just heard

357
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,019
凯文·奥德里奇又在CNB上大放厥词了
Kevin Aldrich is doing a piece for CNB.

358
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,086
他还在利用媒体施压
He's still pressing his case

359
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:26,029
反对我们出兵
Against sending our troops in.

360
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,090
他嫌我们的麻烦还不够多吗
As if getting through this day won't be hard enough.

361
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,070
如果您同意  我可以坐下来同他谈谈
If you want, I can sit down with him

362
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:32,097
让他三思而后行  他就在媒体接待室
And try to get him to hold off; he's in the press room.

363
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:34,037
我不觉得这是个好主意  亨利
I'm not sure that's a good idea, Henry.

364
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:36,010
你现在完全没必要这么做
This is the last thing you need right now,

365
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:38,008
尤其正当舆论界争执不下之时
Especially with public opinion so split.

366
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:49,018
如果你觉得你能说服他  就去做吧
If you think you can talk Aldrich down, do it.

367
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,055
总统阁下
Madame president,

368
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:53,070
参谋长联席会议可以开始了
The joint chiefs are ready.

369
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,090
这是为您准备的简报
Here's your briefing package.

370
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,044
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

371
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,008
你行的
Good luck.

372
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:18,011
材料都在这了吗
Is this everything?

373
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:19,072
是的
It's all there.

374
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:30,059
恕我多嘴
I don't mean to sound like a broken record,

375
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,059
但我怀疑您丈夫能否
But I'm not sure your husband is up

376
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,000
说服得了奥德里奇
To handling Aldrich.

377
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,066
他可以的
Henry's fine.

378
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,027
我得承认他比过去好多了  但...
He's better, I realize that, but...

379
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:39,070
他需要更多的时间
It's going to take more than a few months.

380
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,074
从丧子之痛中挣脱出来
He lost a son.

381
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:42,097
您不也是吗
So did you.

382
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,014
可您没让悲痛
And you haven't let your loss interfere

383
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,095
影响工作
With your job.

384
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:56,079
您丈夫是个坚强的人
Your husband is a strong man,

385
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,079
但他没像您那样想得开
But he doesn't have your resilience.

386
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,016
这不是想不想得开的问题  伊桑
It's not a matter of resilience, Ethan.

387
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:04,003
我无时无刻
There's not a day that goes by,

388
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:07,036
不在怀念我的儿子
Not a moment when I don't think about my son.

389
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:11,000
但我们现在马上要开战了
But I'm about to take this nation to war

390
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:15,065
悲伤对我来说太奢侈了  我承受不起
And grief is a luxury I can't afford right now.

391
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:27,088
在会议开始之前
Before we begin,

392
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,088
首先我想感谢诸位
Let me thank each of you for the time

393
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,089
为此付出的辛勤工作
And work you've put into this operation.

394
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,002
将我们的士兵送上前线
Putting American lives at risk

395
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:37,009
是我一生中
Is the hardest decision

396
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,086
最难的抉择
I've ever had to make...

397
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:42,034
但我已别无选择
But it is one that has to be made.

398
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:48,037
怎么样了
What was that?

399
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,081
修好了
It's working.

400
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,061
-刚才为什么坏了  -仪器过热了
- What was wrong? - it was overheating.

401
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,072
我找到了一个解决办法
I came up with a workaround.

402
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:09,027
试一下
Try it now.

403
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:22,077
好了
There. yeah.

404
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:23,087
现在又可以正常
It's transmitting again.

405
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:27,092
收发数据了
We can send and receive.

406
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:31,055
AA-123号航班
Double a-123

407
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,006
请保持航线
Maintain course.

408
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:36,012
这是怎么回事
What was that?

409
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:37,045
我这边也是
I just got it, too.

410
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,090
你们也失去同步信号了吗
Did you guys lose synch?

411
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,006
我刚才也是  不过现在好了
I did, but we're back up now.

412
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,009
还有人出问题吗
Anybody else lose synch?

413
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,059
-我这边没事  -一切正常
- No, I'm fine. - No, I'm good.

414
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,086
一切正常
I'm fine.

415
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:49,020
出什么事了
What's going on?

416
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:51,053
这听起来有点不可思议
This is gonna sound crazy,

417
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:53,023
但我们三个的屏幕刚才晃动了一阵
But the three of us just got bumped for a second.

418
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,057
但纪录显示电压没有异常
But the log file doesn't show a power surge.

419
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:57,031
故障来自系统内部
This came from the system kernel.

420
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:00,007
这不可能
What are you talking about?

421
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:01,048
系统内部受严密保护
The kernel's protected.

422
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,079
让我查一下
Let me have a look.

423
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,055
我们现在唯一能确定的是托尼·阿尔梅达
All we know for sure is that Almeida is part of a homegrown

424
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:12,072
伙同国内恐怖分子意图破坏基础设施
Terrorist group that's targeting our infrastructure.

425
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:14,006
请你查证一下所有联邦特工机构
He could be working undercover,

426
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:15,056
看看他是不是在当卧底
Some kind of sting operation. you need

427
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:16,099
-执行绝密行动  -我们已经查证了
- To check every federal agency-- we have.

428
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,003
全国各地所有的部门机构

429
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,036
他不是我们的卧底
Almeida's not working for any of them.

430
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,050
他这么做一定另有隐衷
Then there must be some other explanation.

431
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,076
没错
Yeah, there is.

432
00:22:21,077 --> 00:22:23,050
她的老婆被罗根总统
His wife was brutally murdered

433
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,017
指派的政府部门的特工
By a faction operating inside the government,

434
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:26,060
残酷杀害
Led by the president himself.

435
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:28,020
参与那次行动的人要么在蹲大牢
Everybody involved in that is either in prison

436
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,060
要么早被杀掉了
Or has been killed.

437
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:32,031
罗根总统根本没受到实质性的惩罚
The government gave president logan a slap on the wrist,

438
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:33,044
政府和他达成了协议
They cut him a deal.

439
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:34,054
只是把他软禁在
Sentencing him to house arrest

440
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:35,078
一个100英亩大的大农场里而已
On a hundred-acre ranch...?

441
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,021
你认为托尼会为了讨个公道
And you think Tony's looking for justice

442
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,025
而去报复这个国家吗
By attacking this country?

443
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:39,085
阿尔梅达已经一无所有
Almeida lost everything he had,

444
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:41,005
他完全有理由怪罪
And he's blaming it

445
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:42,099
这个他曾为之卖命的政府
On the government he spent his life serving.

446
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:51,017
你比我更能体会这种切肤之痛
But you'd know better than me how that feels...

447
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,021
以及他会怎样报复国家
...how far a man might go.

448
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:58,093
托尼决不至于走到那一步
Not that far.

449
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:01,070
他绝不会的
And not tony almeida.

450
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,091
这件事情一定有个合理的解释
There's a logical explanation for this.

451
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,057
只是你没看清而已
It's just something you're not seeing.

452
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:08,041
帮我找到阿尔梅达  一切就水落石出了
Help me find Almeida and you can ask him yourself.

453
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:12,008
你知道他是怎么想的
You know how he thinks.

454
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:13,058
你们接受过同样的训练
You had the same training.

455
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,019
你们这类人都彼此了解
You know the same people.

456
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:22,006
请授权我彻底查看你们所有
I'm going to need complete access

457
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:25,033
关于此事的原始资料
To all of your source material-- everything you've got on this.

458
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:28,000
请讲
Yes?

459
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:29,036
蕾妮  过来一下  这有新情况
Renee, come out here. something just came in.

460
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:30,073
马上就到
Be right there.

461
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:33,007
所有关于阿尔梅达团伙的资料都在这目录里
Everything we have on Almeida's crew is in this directory.

462
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:36,065
从这里入手... 我马上回来
Start here... I'll be right back.

463
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,041
出什么事了
What's going on?

464
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,045
东北航空交通管制台刚刚报告
Northeast air traffic control just called.

465
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:49,075
他们认为通讯系统
They reported a possible intrusion

466
00:23:49,076 --> 00:23:51,015
不久前有可能
Into their communication systems.

467
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:53,012
-遭到了入侵  -找出是谁干的了吗
- It just happened. - can they source them?

468
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:54,082
他们正在试  但是目前仍一无所获
They're trying, but so far, nothing.

469
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,049
为什么你认为这事和阿尔梅达一伙有关
Why do we think this has to do with Almeida's crew?

470
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,046
我觉得这样的入侵
I don't think you get intrusions like this

471
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:00,086
除非有人暗中操纵
Unless someone's driving it,

472
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:03,080
而唯一能操纵的途径只有突破CIP防火墙
And the only way to drive it is through the cip firewall.

473
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:06,007
所以他们要入侵航空交通管制系统
So they're going after air traffic control.

474
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:07,074
事情看来有些眉目了
That's what it looks like.

475
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,018
请帮我接通白宫
Put me through to the white house.

476
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:16,008
你准备在纽约转机吗
You doing a turnaround in New York?

477
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:17,078
不了  准备休息两天
Nope. got two days off.

478
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,098
准备去找我男朋友玩
I'm meeting my boyfriend in the city.

479
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:23,006
那敢情好
Oh, that'll be fun.

480
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:33,030
道尔刚告诉我会遇上坏天气
Well, Doug said we were going to hit some weather.

481
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:41,097
我需要技术人员来交叉比对资料
I'm going to need tech support to cross-reference your files.

482
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:44,004
我让分析师西恩·希林格帮你完成
You'll be working with one of my analysts, sean hillinger.

483
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:45,054
他会给你所有你需要的情报
He can get you whatever files you need

484
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:46,081
来帮助我们找到阿尔梅达
To help us find Almeida.

485
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:48,034
不错  他们提升警戒等级了吗
Good. they raise the threat level yet?

486
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:51,061
看来阿尔梅达一伙已对航管系统下手了
Yeah. we think Almeida's group got into air traffic control.

487
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:53,055
什么  不可能
What? that doesn't make sense.

488
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,038
我用不着你想破脑袋  杰克
I don't need you to figure it out, Jack.

489
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,038
帮我找到他就行
Just help me find him.

490
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,069
西恩  这是杰克·鲍尔
Sean, this is Jack Bauer.

491
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,099
他会和你一起研究阿尔梅达的资料
He's going to be working with the Almeida files.

492
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,086
给他所需的一切资料
Give him whatever he needs.

493
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:02,049
那和联邦航空局联系的活儿谁干
What about interfacing with FAA?

494
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,073
詹尼斯正和多曼的手下一起干呢
Janis is working with some of Dornan's people on that.

495
00:25:04,074 --> 00:25:06,026
-你帮好杰克就行了  -好的
You just help Jack. Fine.

496
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:08,083
-我去登记  -谢谢
I'll check in. thanks.

497
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:10,006
你想看些什么资料呢
What do you want to see?

498
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:11,077
就从这次技术盗窃案开始吧
Let's start with the technology thefts.

499
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:13,010
一共有多少
How many were there?

500
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,054
6份
Six.

501
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,050
试着进行一次全面的资料比对
Let's run a comp on all of them.

502
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:19,012
好极了
Fantastic.

503
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,008
远征航母舰队
The expeditionary strike force

504
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:26,008
及其海军航空队已经就位
And its carrier air wing are now on scene.

505
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:29,028
这样一来我们有更大的把握取得先机
This gives us full spectrum dominance of the battle space.

506
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,079
你估计朱玛的武装力量
What kind of resistance are you anticipating

507
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,019
会有多大程度的抵抗
From Juma's military?

508
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,086
微乎其微
Minimal.

509
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:37,042
我们的空军将横扫任何防御体系
Our air strikes will take out whatever defenses they've got.

510
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:40,066
只待我军直捣黄龙了
We can expect an open path to Juma's front door.

511
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,091
很好
Good.

512
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:44,030
万事俱备  只需您的一声令下了
All we need to launch is a go order from you.

513
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:46,037
看过斯蒂芬的战后评估报告后
You'll get a green light as soon as I've gone over

514
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:48,040
我就会给你下命令
Secretary stevens' post-invasion report,

515
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:51,004
不过他还没给我
Which I'm still waiting for.

516
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:54,028
几分钟后就给你  总统阁下
I'll have it for you in a few minutes, ma'am.

517
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:57,015
有什么问题就说
Unless there's a problem you'd like to discuss.

518
00:25:57,016 --> 00:26:00,025
总统阁下  我对本次行动所持的异议
Madame president, my objection to this operation isn't

519
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,032
对在座诸位已不是什么秘密了
A secret to anyone in this room.

520
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,085
出兵干涉地球另一边的内战
For us to be wading into the middle

521
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:05,042
对于我们来说...
Of another civil conflict halfway around the world...

522
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:07,035
别再无休止地争论下去了  乔
We're done debating this, Joe.

523
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:10,079
当本杰明·朱玛大肆屠杀20多万同胞时
The UN's been issuing reprimands and economic sanctions

524
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,083
联合国还在忙于下达
While Benjamin Juma has slaughtered

525
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:14,030
对其施加的经济制裁令
Over 200,000 of his own people.

526
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,026
如果我们不阻止他
That number will continue to grow

527
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:18,073
伤亡数字还会持续上升
If we don't stop him now.

528
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:21,034
如果你不愿支持我们
And if you can't get behind what we're doing,

529
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:23,097
我会换一个支持我的国务卿
I'll find a secretary of state who can.

530
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:26,065
但是  我受够了你的消极态度
But I am done with your handwringing.

531
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:29,038
对不起  总统阁下
Excuse me, madame president.

532
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,025
国土安全局的蒂姆·伍兹在外面候着呢
Tim Woods from homeland security is outside.

533
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,032
他有事要见你
He needs to see you on another matter.

534
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:35,065
让他等等不行吗
Can it wait?

535
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,079
不行啊  是急事
No, ma'am, it can't.

536
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,039
好吧
All right.

537
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,032
等我回来  我们继续
We'll continue when I return.

538
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:46,054
乔  希望我回来时报告已经做好了
And, Joe, I want that report in front of me when I get back.

539
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,077
什么事情
What is it?

540
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,027
我不知道详细情况
I don't have the details,

541
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,091
但事关我国有被入侵的潜在危机
But it involves a potential domestic breach.

542
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:00,021
蒂姆会跟我们解释的
Tim is here to fill us in.

543
00:27:00,022 --> 00:27:01,048
总统阁下
Madame president.

544
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,008
蒂姆  长话短说  大家还等着开会呢
Tim, make this brief; the joint chiefs are waiting.

545
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:06,088
关于这起系列技术盗窃案
We've been working with the FBI the last eight weeks,

546
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:08,068
我们已和联邦调查局合作调查了近两月
Investigating a series of technology thefts.

547
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:11,075
直到今天我们才恍然大悟
We didn't understand the implications of this until today.

548
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,042
就是这同一伙人劫持了一个名叫
The same people behind these thefts abducted a man

549
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:14,092
迈克尔·拉森的人
Named Michael Latham.

550
00:27:14,093 --> 00:27:16,042
他是负责国家重点基础设施
He's one of the chief engineers in charge

551
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:17,086
防火墙工程的首席工程师之一
of protecting critical infrastructure.

552
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:20,043
说说我们此刻面临的麻烦是什么吧
Now, tell me what we're dealing with.

553
00:27:20,044 --> 00:27:22,080
联邦调查局认为他们强迫拉森
The FBI thinks these same people have forced Latham

554
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:25,073
制造了一种入侵CIP防火墙的装置
To create a device to hack through the CIP firewall.

555
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:28,037
在防火墙保护之下的是
The firewall protects

556
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:30,027
国家的能源 水电 交通运输
Energy, utilities, transportation...

557
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:35,028
我此行是因为联邦航空局报告说
I'm here because the FAA reported some irregularities

558
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,094
航管系统出现了一些异常
In their air traffic control system.

559
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:40,021
你是说商务航班正受到威胁
Are you saying commercial flights are in danger?

560
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:42,022
很有可能
Possibly.

561
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:45,059
要我下达禁飞令吗
Do I need to give the order to ground air traffic?

562
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,092
恐怕没那么容易
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

563
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:49,032
现在美国领空范围内
Right now, there are more than 3,000 flights

564
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,089
有3000多架飞机
Over the continental United States.

565
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,069
要让所有的飞机停飞最少要12个小时
To ground them all would take 12 hours, minimum,

566
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,063
这同时也会造成恐慌
And it could create a panic.

567
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:57,013
那你的建议呢
Then what do you recommend?

568
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:59,047
先不动声色地减少起飞的航班数量
Let us quietly decrease air traffic

569
00:27:59,048 --> 00:28:01,044
同时让调查局继续暗中查找线索
While the bureau works their leads.

570
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:03,034
我们会确保向您进行实时汇报
We'll make sure you're briefed on a real-time basis.

571
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:06,037
我觉得事有蹊跷
I don't like the timing of this...

572
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:07,091
什么蹊跷
Timing?

573
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:10,061
这事和我们要插手桑加拉一事有关系吗
Could this be connected to our intervention in Sangala?

574
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:12,088
联邦调查局还没找到任何关联的地方
The FBI hasn't found any connection.

575
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,028
所有证据显示我们对付的是
All the evidence suggests that we're dealing

576
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:16,045
本国的恐怖分子集团
with a domestic terror group, homegrown,

577
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,072
是强烈的反政府狂热者
with a strong, anti-government bias.

578
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:19,012
根据你提到的这些线索...
And these leads you mentioned--

579
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:21,029
你们能否在他们造成任何
Do you think you'll be able to catch these people

580
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,032
实质性破坏之前逮捕他们呢
Before they do any real damage?

581
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:26,043
调查局已动用了所有人手展开行动
The bureau's got everyone on it, ma'am.

582
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:29,026
你并没有回答我的问题
You didn't answer my question.

583
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:31,071
是的  总统阁下
No, ma'am. I didn't.

584
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,086
当然  我不是说要宽恕朱诺的滔天罪行
Of course, I don't condone what Juma's doing over there.

585
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:51,080
全世界到处都存在种族纷争
But tribal wars are being fought all over the world.

586
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:53,097
但为什么不是介入泰国或马来西亚呢
Why not intervene in Thailand, Malaysia?

587
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,024
这不是种族纷争  凯文
This isn't a tribal war, Kevin.

588
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,084
这分明是种族屠杀
It's a genocide.

589
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,071
制止屠杀是作为超级大国的
Ending it is the moral obligation

590
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:00,031
我们所肩负的职责
Of a nation as powerful as ours.

591
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,014
理想倒是蛮崇高的
That's a lofty aspiration,

592
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:04,035
但是现实可要复杂多了
But the reality is a lot more complex.

593
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:07,038
总统介入此事是经深思熟虑的
The president's going into this with both eyes open.

594
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,082
铲除朱玛之后她如何能确定
How can she be sure the cycle of violence won't continue

595
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,015
事态会不再恶化呢
After Juma's been taken out?

596
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,072
也许为了维持和平...
Could be stuck there indefinitely...

597
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:14,036
我们会陷入无休止的战争泥潭中
Keeping the peace.

598
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:16,056
如果我提供你做一个总统
If I gave you an exclusive preview of the president's

599
00:29:16,057 --> 00:29:18,049
战后预案的独家报道
Post-invasion plans,

600
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,060
你也许就会改变主意了
You might change your mind.

601
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:23,070
你想用专访来收买我吗
You're trying to bribe me with an exclusive?

602
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:25,067
我只是想让你高抬贵手行个方便
I'm trying to get you to give us some rope.

603
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:28,044
你想让我怎么做  不写了
What are you asking me to do, stop writing

604
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,054
还是写我不想写的
Or write what I don't believe?

605
00:29:30,055 --> 00:29:33,035
悉听尊便
Either one would be fine with me.

606
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:39,011
长官  您有一个专线电话
Sir, you have a phone call on your private line.

607
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:43,003
失陪一下好吗  凯文
Could you excuse me for a moment, please, kevin.

608
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:51,069
是查克·托兰  长官
It's Chuck Toland, sir.

609
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,084
等一下
Wait.

610
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,010
查克  有什么发现吗
Chuck, did you find something?

611
00:29:58,011 --> 00:29:59,077
是的  但别高兴得太早
I did, but don't get carried away.

612
00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:02,060
这并没确证你对罗杰死因的推测
It doesn't confirm your theory about how Roger died.

613
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:04,027
而是另有蹊跷
But it is suspicious.

614
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:06,024
我洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

615
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,098
他的女朋友萨曼莎在罗杰自杀
His girlfriend samantha received a large

616
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,038
三天后收到了一大笔来自
Lump-sum deposit in an off-shore bank account

617
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:12,071
海外账户的汇款
About three days after Roger's suicide.

618
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:14,075
你是说他其实是被谋杀的
You mean his alleged suicide.

619
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:16,028
是的  长官
Right, sir.

620
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:17,099
这笔钱是从哪来的
Where did the money come from?

621
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,082
不知道  看起来是洗过的钱
I couldn't tell. it looks like it's been washed.

622
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,089
来路不明
There's no readily identifiable source.

623
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,033
那  这说明了什么吗
So... what does this mean?

624
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:29,003
这说明她突然多了40万美金
All it means is that she suddenly came into $400,000.

625
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:30,063
要是想查出更多东西
If we're going to find out anything more,

626
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:32,000
我就得亲自去跟她谈谈
I'm going to need to talk to her personally.

627
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,070
你希望我这么做吗
Is that how you want me to handle it?

628
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:36,080
不  如果她确实有所隐瞒
No. if she's got anything to hide,

629
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,094
她不会和私人侦探说的
She's not going to talk to a private investigator.

630
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:40,001
的确
I agree.

631
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:41,034
那你现在需要我怎么做呢
So how do you want me to proceed?

632
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:43,064
我会亲自出马和她谈
I'll talk to her myself.

633
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:45,041
她还在那家经纪公司吗
Is she still at that brokerage firm?

634
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,028
是的 斯隆奇志经纪公司
Yeah, uh, Sloane Kittridge.

635
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:49,008
很好
Good.

636
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:52,002
我和奥德里奇谈完后
I'm going to finish up here with Aldrich.

637
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,092
带我去一个地方
Then I need you to take me somewhere,

638
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:55,032
不要做记录
And keep it off the manifest.

639
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,096
我不想让任何人知道我们的去向
I don't want anyone to know where we're going.

640
00:30:56,097 --> 00:30:59,026
-遵命  长官  -盖奇探员
Yes, sir. Agent Gedge.

641
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:01,060
在  长官
Yes, sir.

642
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:04,037
你觉得查克是在利用我  对吗
You think Chuck's taking advantage of me, don't you?

643
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:06,063
我觉得我不适合做任何评论
It's not my place to say that, sir.

644
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,034
我就是要听听你的想法
I'm asking you anyway.

645
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:11,001
警方和联邦调查局都在调查
Sir, the police and FBI have both investigated

646
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,071
你儿子的死因
Your son's death.

647
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:16,004
是的  我认为这个私人侦探就是在
And yes, I believe this PI could be exploiting

648
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:18,001
利用您的悲痛来中饱私囊
Your grief for personal gain.

649
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,018
他的所谓的线索都是无稽之谈
These so-called leads that he's generating have led nowhere.

650
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:23,062
我儿子是不会自杀的
My son didn't kill himself.

651
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:26,019
我坚信这一点
I'm sure of it.

652
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,077
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

653
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:34,040
你能再查一下那个端口吗
Can you check that socket again, please?

654
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,063
联邦航空局有报告什么异常吗
Has FAA reported any more anomalies?

655
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:38,087
在那三个之后就没有了  可能只是个小故障
Not since the first three. maybe it was just a glitch?

656
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:40,097
很可能是侵入防火墙时
Or it could have been a ripple caused when they broke through

657
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,030
所引起的一次波纹干扰
The firewall and entered the system.

658
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:44,051
如果他们侵入了系统  我怎么会看不到呢
Well, if they're in the system, I can't see them,

659
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:45,087
我检查了所有的ELR端口
And I've checked every ELR socket.

660
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:47,027
继续找
Keep looking.

661
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:48,081
蕾妮
Renee...

662
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:51,091
会发生什么事
Uh, what's going to happen?

663
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:54,008
-你什么意思  -如果阿尔梅达侵入了防火墙
What do you mean? if Almeida has broken through the firewall

664
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:56,015
我们就完了  不是吗
Then we're screwed, right?

665
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:58,065
我是说  同水源污染和电力中断相比
I mean, crashing a couple planes is really nothing compared

666
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,092
弄下来几架飞机
To contaminating the water system

667
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:01,052
已经根本不算什么了
Or bringing down the power grid...

668
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,079
不要这么想  詹尼斯
Don't think about it, Janis.

669
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,023
继续工作吧
Just stay on task.

670
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,066
好吧
Okay, so...

671
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:11,027
我会保持冷静的  好吗
I will just stay calm, right?

672
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:13,014
很好
Yeah.

673
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:19,051
回到第二份
Pull up the second one.

674
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:21,071
你已经看过了
You already looked at it.

675
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,002
我需要再看一遍  回去
I want to look at it again, pull it up.

676
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,085
-有什么发现吗  -没有  我们还在
Have you found anything? no, we keep looking

677
00:32:27,086 --> 00:32:30,069
一遍遍地翻看同样的六份鉴证科材料
At the same six forensic reports over and over.

678
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,072
你在找什么  杰克
What are you looking for, Jack?

679
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:34,002
-一个切入点  -他们有通行证
An entry point. they had access cards.

680
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:36,052
是的  但是没有报告表明有通行证被盗
Yeah, but no one reported their access cards stolen,

681
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:37,073
-意味着通行证是伪造的  -那么
Which means they were forged. so...?

682
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:39,086
这些通行证都有个人签名
These access cards have individual signatures,

683
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:41,010
几乎不可能被伪造
Making them almost impossible to forge.

684
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:42,096
只有几个人能办到
There's only a couple guys who can do it.

685
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:45,083
你能进入反恐小组的资料库吗
Can you access old ctu files?

686
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:47,033
没问题
Sure.

687
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:50,048
调出1999年8月代号为哈特勒斯的档案
Pull up August 1999. Hatteras.

688
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:53,088
-刚接到国土安全局的电话  -怎么说
Just got a call from homeland. and?

689
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:55,054
他们已经报告总统了
They briefed the president

690
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:57,018
但她还不打算发布禁飞令
But she's not ready to ground planes yet.

691
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,021
在这  哈特勒斯档案
Here you go. Hatteras file.

692
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:00,028
知道吗  你可以雇佣一个时薪14美元的
You know, you can hire a $14.00-an-hour

693
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:02,028
数据管理员来干这个活  根本用不着我
Data applications geek to do this; you don't need me.

694
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:04,029
我可没时间登广告
I wouldn't advertise that.

695
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,039
在这  加布里埃尔·谢克特
There he is-- Gabriel Schector.

696
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,039
他是谁
Who is he?

697
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,056
一个供应商
He was a supplier.

698
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:12,043
托尼和我常在他那买些逃税的东西
Tony and I used him to buy things off-book.

699
00:33:12,044 --> 00:33:14,000
看他是否在你们的资料库里
See if he's in your database.

700
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,076
有了
Yeah. he's there.

701
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,027
他还在洛杉矶吗
Is he still in Los Angeles?

702
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:20,054
不  根据资料显示
No. according to this earmark,

703
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:22,014
他9个月前去了华盛顿
He came to dc nine weeks ago.

704
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:24,041
盗窃案一周后就发生了
The thefts started a week after that.

705
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:26,051
这就是你们要找的人
That's your guy.

706
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:29,018
-有地址吗  -他在市中心租了一个办公室
Do you have an address? he's subletting an office downtown--

707
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:32,078
内勒路1208号  630号套房
1208 Naylor Road, Suite 630.

708
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,092
很好  带上战术小组  把他带来
All right, put a field team together, pick him up.

709
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,058
我致电西蒙斯法官  申请逮捕令
I'll call judge Simons, have a warrant ready.

710
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,065
-这样行不通  -为什么
That's a mistake. why?

711
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,095
你们没有时间去履行程序
You don't have time to go through the motions

712
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:42,032
对于谢克特  你拿出逮捕令
With Schector-- you serve him with a warrant,

713
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:43,089
他会叫律师  尽可能地拖延时间
He'll call his lawyers, he'll stall as long as he needs.

714
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,026
那么  你的主意是什么  杰克
So, what's the alternative, Jack?

715
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:50,013
闯进去  严刑逼供  像你以前的做法
Break in and torture the guy, like you used to do?

716
00:33:50,014 --> 00:33:52,088
这不就是你在参议院听证会所陈述的吗
Isn't that how you ended up in front of a senate sub-committee?

717
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:57,034
就是这样的过程吗
Oh, is this how it starts?

718
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,031
你一拳打在我脸上  勒住我的脖子
You get in my face, tighten your jaw,

719
00:33:59,032 --> 00:34:01,041
如果我不合作
Then if I say something you don't like,

720
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,074
你就把我往墙上撞
You slam me against the wall.

721
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:04,068
你根本不知道我会做什么
You have no idea what I do.

722
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:08,008
上次你叫我来  要我帮你
And last time I checked, you subpoenaed me.

723
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:10,005
给你建议  我做了
You want my help, you want my advice, take it.

724
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,052
如果你不需要  那就算了
You don't, don't.

725
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:13,022
我不在乎
I don't care.

726
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:15,072
鲍尔先生  你说你曾经和谢克特共事过
Mr. Bauer... you said you used to work with this man schector.

727
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:16,089
他很了解你吗
How well does he know you?

728
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,024
非常了解
He knows me.

729
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,057
拉里  我能和你谈谈吗
Larry, can I talk to you for a second?

730
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:36,058
-我想让鲍尔和我一起去  -不行
I want to take Bauer with me. no.

731
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:39,031
想都别想  我不能让他对嫌犯动手
Forget it. I'm not letting him put his hands on a suspect.

732
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:41,005
他不需要这么做
He won't need to put his hands on anybody.

733
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:43,035
我猜如果他去  谢克特肯定会说的
My guess is if he's in the room, schector will talk.

734
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,079
蕾妮  你看见了他刚才的行为
Renee, you saw what he just...

735
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,019
我只想在情况恶化之前找到阿尔梅达
I'm trying to find Almeida before it's too late,

736
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,092
而谢克特是我们最好的线索
And Schector is our best lead.

737
00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:51,083
你想和鲍尔同流合污吗
So you want to intimidate him with Bauer?

738
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:53,049
谢克特知道鲍尔的手段
Schector knows how far Bauer might go.

739
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,083
我们可以利用这一点
Let's use that.

740
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:56,083
好吧  要是谢克特不屈服呢  怎么办
Yeah, and if Schector doesn't blink, then what?

741
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:59,027
我会看住鲍尔的
I'll keep Bauer on a short leash.

742
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:01,077
蕾妮  我们是联邦调查局  不是反恐小组
Renee, we're the fbi, not ctu. we honor the law.

743
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:03,067
我们依法行事  即使事情很棘手
Even when it's not convenient.

744
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:06,014
拉里  情况正在逐渐恶化
Look, this situation is heating up fast, Larry.

745
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:07,044
现在总统也介入了
The president's into it now,

746
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:08,061
她希望得到结果
And she's expecting results.

747
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:10,031
是的  我明白了
Yeah, I know.

748
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:13,011
你来决定吧
It's your call.

749
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:16,009
但我向你保证  我会看住鲍尔
But I promise you, I can handle Bauer.

750
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,082
好吧
All right.

751
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:26,036
我让你来负责
But I'm holding you responsible.

752
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:28,016
我会派支援过去的
And I'm sending backup teams.

753
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:30,011
好的
Okay.

754
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:32,087
杰克
Jack.

755
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,068
你跟我走  按我说的做
You're coming with me, and you're doing this my way.

756
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
跟我说说谢克特
Tell me about Schector.

757
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,005
在他自己干之前  他在圣地亚哥干
Out of San Diego, till he went on his own.

758
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:01,062
合法的吗
Legitimate?

759
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,056
是的  刚开始是  后来他越来越贪婪
Yeah, at first, then he got greedy.

760
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:05,026
开始利用他的关系获取各种技术
Started using his connections to acquire

761
00:36:05,027 --> 00:36:07,009
然后在黑市上贩卖
Technology, sell it on the gray market.

762
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,046
-他卖给谁  恐怖分子吗  -不
Who'd he sell to, terrorists? no.

763
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:11,060
通常是那些试着钻法律空子的外国政府
Usually foreign governments trying to get around treaties.

764
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:13,071
你和托尼是怎么认识他的
And how did you and Tony get involved with him?

765
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,007
他是个很好的情报来源
He was a great conduit for intel.

766
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:20,014
反恐小组不介意 你们和他的交易吗
CTU didn't mind that you Were letting this guy stay in business?

767
00:36:20,015 --> 00:36:21,094
反恐小组根本不知道
CTU didn't know.

768
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,021
只有我和托尼知道
It was just Tony and me.

769
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:25,065
你和托尼关系很好吗
So you and Tony were tight?

770
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:28,048
是的
Yeah...

771
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:29,062
非常好
Yeah, we were close.

772
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:32,039
好吧  听起来像是这个
All right, so it sounds like Tony,

773
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,079
大家都认为死了的托尼
Who everyone thinks is dead,

774
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,006
计划了威胁美国安全的恐怖行动
Puts together a plan to hijack American security.

775
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:37,092
他找谢克特来帮助他实施计划
He contacts Schector to help him with this plan.

776
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:39,029
听起来是这样
Yeah.

777
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,006
看起来你还是不相信
Except you don't believe it.

778
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:42,009
托尼会这样做
That Tony's dirty.

779
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,053
我只相信托尼还活着
I believe that Tony's alive.

780
00:36:44,054 --> 00:36:46,007
我觉得他是在铤而走险
And I believe he's doing something dangerous,

781
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:48,024
所以我们必须找到他
And that we need to find him.

782
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,096
已经确认谢克特在里面
We confirmed Schector's inside.

783
00:37:11,097 --> 00:37:14,043
-你想怎么做  -我和鲍尔进去
How do you want to handle this? I'm going in with Bauer.

784
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:16,026
-你自己  -我想让谢克特开口
Alone? I want Schector to talk.

785
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:18,074
我不想吓到他  支援来了告诉我
I don't want to spook him. call me when backup gets here.

786
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:26,054
马托波的部队藏匿在
Matobo's fighters are hidden outside the capital

787
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:28,001
首都外围的三个营地中
In three camps.

788
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:30,064
一号  二号和三号
Alpha, beta and delta.

789
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:33,005
一旦空中打击完成
Our ground forces will join up with them

790
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:34,071
我们的地面部队会和他们交火
Once the air strikes are completed.

791
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:37,005
要确保瓦格纳将军实施
Make sure general Wagner understands

792
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,042
控制城市秩序的首要作战计划
Our priority is to maintain order in the streets.

793
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:41,095
民众想要看到的是
The people need to see that their

794
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:43,092
他们的国家是在法律的监管之下
Country's being governed under the rule of law.

795
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:45,063
要是马托波在没有审判的前提下
What happens when Matobo's men

796
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:47,013
就对朱玛将军进行处决  我们怎么办
Execute general Juma without a trial?

797
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,031
我们是插手  还是让他们自己解决
Should we intervene or let the mob tear them apart?

798
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:53,070
我一会就要和马托波先生会面
I'm meeting with Mr. Matobo

799
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,057
就在几分钟后
In a few minutes.

800
00:37:55,058 --> 00:37:58,005
我会让他管好他的人
I'll make sure he keeps his men in line.

801
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:00,021
乔
And, Joe,

802
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:01,064
我很抱歉让你在众位参谋长
I was wrong to dress you down

803
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:03,004
面前很没面子
In front of the joint chiefs.

804
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:04,034
对不起
I'm sorry.

805
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:05,081
您无需道歉  总统阁下
No need to apologize, madame president.

806
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,015
您的压力太大了
You're under a lot of pressure.

807
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:08,052
这不是借口
That's still no excuse.

808
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:11,005
谢谢  我很感谢您这样说
Thank you, ma'am, I appreciate that.

809
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:15,039
但是如果你不能处理好这事
The fact remains, if you can't get behind this operation

810
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,057
我会要你辞职
With both shoulders, I will need your resignation.

811
00:38:19,057 --> 00:38:21,006
请放心  总统阁下
That won't be necessary, ma'am.

812
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,093
无论我有什么疑问
Whatever doubts I have,

813
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:25,036
-我都会守口如瓶  -很好
I'll keep them to myself. good.

814
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,090
打扰了  总统阁下
Excuse me, madame president.

815
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:28,017
什么事  伊桑
What is it, Ethan?

816
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:30,004
我认为应该告诉您
I thought you'd want to know,

817
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:32,057
亨利和奥德里奇已经达成协议
Henry and Aldrich has agreed to delay his broadcast

818
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:33,087
将报道推迟24小时
For 24 hours.

819
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:35,024
亨利成功了
Henry's doing?

820
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:37,074
我  低估了他
I, uh, underestimated him.

821
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:39,085
让他介入是正确的
Letting him intervene was the right call.

822
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:41,045
这是个好消息
Well, that's some good news.

823
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:43,052
防火墙的情况怎么样了
What about the firewall situation?

824
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:45,025
联邦调查局有什么进展吗
Has the FBI made any progress?

825
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:48,005
他们已经找到了一个与之有关联的人
They've identified a man who may have information.

826
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:50,000
正准备审讯他
They're about to question him.

827
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:55,013
谢克特是不会轻易
It's more than likely

828
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:57,017
把消息告诉你的
Schector's not going to give you this information easily.

829
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:00,050
记住  这是联邦调查局的行动
Just remember, this is an FBI operation.

830
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:02,047
我们要依法行事
We work within the confines of the law.

831
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,097
你可以威胁他  但别对他动手
You can threaten him, but do not lay hands on him.

832
00:39:05,098 --> 00:39:07,037
一旦我看到你越轨
The minute I see you crossing that line,

833
00:39:07,038 --> 00:39:08,091
我就把你抓起来  明白吗
I will pull you back, understood?

834
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:11,022
明白
Understood.

835
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:23,072
沃克探员  联邦调查局
Agent Walker, FBI.

836
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:25,047
我要见加布里埃尔·谢克特
I'm here to talk to Gabriel Schector.

837
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,091
稍等
Just a second.

838
00:39:35,078 --> 00:39:37,035
有什么我能效劳的吗
Can I help you?

839
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:40,074
杰克·鲍尔
Jack Bauer?

840
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,021
你好啊  加布里
How are you, Gabe?

841
00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:44,034
你竟然加入联邦调查局了
Didn't know you were FBI.

842
00:39:44,035 --> 00:39:46,028
我没有
I'm not.

843
00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:48,005
只是顺便过来看看你
Just came along for the ride.

844
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:49,068
鲍尔先生现在归我管
Mr. Bauer is here under my authority.

845
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:53,059
这么说他在这做的一切
Oh, so I can hold you responsible for anything

846
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,032
我都可以找你算账咯
He does while he's here.

847
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:56,099
我可有证人
I have a witness.

848
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,087
是的
Sure.

849
00:40:00,027 --> 00:40:01,083
好吧
Okay.

850
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:04,014
请进
Come on in.

851
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:10,004
请随便
Please.

852
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:12,035
坐
Have a seat.

853
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:21,001
这应该是一次很有趣的谈话
This should be an interesting conversation.

854
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,022
多久没见了  杰克
How long's it been, Jack?

855
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:25,022
有几年了
Years.

856
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:28,092
参议院听证会的事怎么样了
How's the, uh... senate thing doing?

857
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,049
我听说反恐小组被撤销了
I hear they dismantled the ctu.

858
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,029
别告诉我
Don't tell me.

859
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,016
这是你的错  不是吗
It was your fault, wasn't it?

860
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,090
谢克特先生  我们不是来闲聊的
Mr.Schector, we're not here to make small talk.

861
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:39,017
我有几个问题
I have questions.

862
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:41,043
好的  我洗耳恭听
Well, you have my undivided attention.

863
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:43,027
托尼·阿尔梅达在哪
Where's Tony Almeida?

864
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:45,044
托尼·阿尔梅达
Tony Almeida?

865
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:47,037
在地下  我猜
In the ground, I suppose.

866
00:40:47,038 --> 00:40:48,074
除非他被火化了
Unless he was cremated.

867
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:52,038
他不是在反恐小组时就挂了吗
Didn't he die at CTU a while back?

868
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,018
你与此事无关  加布里
You got an out here, gabe.

869
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:56,078
他们不是来找你的
They're not after you.

870
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,015
他们只是好奇
They're willing to accept that

871
00:40:58,016 --> 00:41:00,012
托尼·阿尔梅达想用
You didn't know what Tony Almeida was going to do

872
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:01,093
你帮忙偷来的组件做什么
With the components that you helped him steal.

873
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,049
我可不知道有人偷了组件
Nobody I knew

874
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,050
就算是他们干的
Stole anything, and if they did,

875
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,033
我也毫不知情
I knew nothing about it.

876
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:14,027
事情比你想象的要严重得多  谢克特先生
This is far more serious than you know, Mr. Schector.

877
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:15,050
如果你帮我们找到阿尔梅达
If you help us find Almeida,

878
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:17,047
我可以保证你免于司法起诉
I can see to it that you're kept in the clear.

879
00:41:17,048 --> 00:41:18,091
否则
Otherwise,

880
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:21,042
你会被认定为恐怖分子的同谋而遭起诉
You could be a co-conspirator to multiple terrorist acts.

881
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:26,009
我想我们的谈话结束了
No, well, I think this conversation is over.

882
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:30,032
我尽力诚实地回答你所有的问题
I tried to answer all your questions honestly,

883
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:32,002
但是  从现在起
But I think, from now on,

884
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:33,052
你只能和我的律师谈了
You can speak to my lawyers.

885
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:34,085
所以
So,

886
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:36,039
再见了  杰克
Good-bye, Jack.

887
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,046
我祝参议院好运  希望你完蛋
And good luck with the senate. hope they fry your ass.

888
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:40,016
阿里
Ari,

889
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:42,033
送客
Could you show these people to the door, please.

890
00:41:42,034 --> 00:41:44,050
你确定要这么做吗
Are you sure you want to play it like this?

891
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:46,024
我就是这么确定  杰克
Yeah, that's the way I want to play, Jack.

892
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:53,014
-把枪放下  -放下枪
Drop your weapon. drop it now!

893
00:41:53,015 --> 00:41:55,088
好的  好的
Okay, okay, okay.

894
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:57,084
你们两个会进监狱的
You two are going to prison!

895
00:41:57,085 --> 00:42:00,035
这是暴力行为
This was unprovoked! unprovoked!

896
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:03,012
你的人阿里先掏的抢  我有证人
Your man Ari was going for his gun-- I've got a witness.

897
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:07,089
为什么我们不再谈谈呢
Why don't we try having this conversation again.

898
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,066
托尼·阿尔梅达在哪
Where is Tony Almeida?

899
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:10,082
不
No.

900
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,043
我不和你谈
I'm not talking to you.

901
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,054
他在哪
Where is he?

902
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:19,060
托尼·阿尔梅达已经死了

903
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:22,018
你想要我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

904
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,035
你来决定
This is your call.

905
00:42:28,008 --> 00:42:30,009
好好修理他
Do whatever it takes.

906
00:42:32,062 --> 00:42:34,015
这是违法的
This is against the law.

907
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:35,051
你不能这么做
You can't do this.

908
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,052
我很乐于这么做
I'm gonna enjoy this.

909
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:38,099
乐于做什么
Enjoy what?

910
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,086
好吧  好吧
All right, all right!

好吧
All right!

912
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:45,040
我会告诉你我知道的
I'll tell you what I know!

913
00:42:46,027 --> 00:42:48,033
我可不想为了这事
There's no need

914
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:51,027
弄瞎我的眼睛
For me to lose my good looks over this.

915
00:42:52,014 --> 00:42:53,013
很好
Okay.

916
00:42:53,014 --> 00:42:56,031
上次我见到阿尔梅达
Last time I saw Almeida...

917
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:04,051
你没事吧
Are you all right?

918
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,072
没事
Yeah.

919

告诉你的人
Tell your men they've got a shooter

别插手这事  杰克
Get away from this, Jack.

927
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:27,040
托尼
Tony?

928
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:30,017
你和联邦调查局都无法阻止这事了
There's nothing you or the FBI can do about this.

929
00:43:30,018 --> 00:43:31,094
放弃吧
Just stay away.

930
00:43:31,095 --> 00:43:33,087
托尼  告诉我
Tony, just talk to me.

931
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:34,087
到底是怎么回事
What the hell's going...

932

托尼

谢克特办公室情况怎么样了
What's going on at Schector's office?

935
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,060
不知道  他们还没有汇报
I don't know. they haven't checked in yet.
