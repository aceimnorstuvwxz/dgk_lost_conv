《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,083
我是肯·德奥  CNB的记者
Ken Dellao,CNB.

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,000
我想跟您确认一条信息
I'm wondering if you can confirm some information.

4
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:22,090
我想在今晚的报道中播报
I'm gonna be reporting in this evening's broadcast

5
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:25,001
一名叫杰克·鲍尔的前联邦探员
that a rogue ex-federal agent named Jack Bauer

6
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:27,081
涉嫌谋杀了莱恩·伯内特
is the prime suspect in the murder of Ryan Burnett.

7
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:29,078
你把伯内特被杀的消息
You leaked this story of Burnett's murder

8
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:31,071
还有我的介入都透露给了媒体
and my involvement to the press.

9
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:33,071
那么你又一次的失策
So another one of your errors in

10
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:35,052
让你搬起石头砸了自己的脚
judgment bites you on the ass.

11
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,045
你这一次玩得过火了
You've gone too far this time.

12
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:39,049
蕾妮  我是杰克  拜托别挂电话
Renee,it's Jack. Don't hang up the phone,please.

13
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,055
不论他们怎么说  我没杀伯内特
Whatever they told you,I did not kill Burnett.

14
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:43,086
我把真凶的照片发给你了
I sent you a photo of the man who did.

15
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:45,086
我只是想让你查明他的身份
All I want you to do is make an ID.

16
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:48,050
约翰·奎恩  参与秘密行动的退伍老兵
John Quinn,Black Ops combat vet.

17
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:50,006
现在为斯塔克伍德公司卖命
He works for Starkwood.

18
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,023
斯塔克伍德和朱玛是一伙的吗
Starkwood work with Juma?

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,080
即使是  也根本无案可查
If they did,it wasn't on the books.

20
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:54,097
但若有人知情  就一定是迈尔参议员
You know,if anyone knows,it's senator Mayer.

21
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:58,017
蕾妮  鲍尔在哪
Renee,where's Bauer?

22
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,014
-不知道  -别骗我
- I don't know. - Don't you lie to me.

23
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:02,013
我们知道你进入了政府机密数据库
We know you accessed a classified government database

24
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:04,048
把某人的姓名和地址发给了鲍尔
and sent someone's name and address to Bauer.

25
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:05,068
告诉我他在哪
Tell me where he is.

26
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:06,085
我办不到
I can't.

27
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:08,005
把她关起来
Put her in holding.

28
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:10,005
告知她应享有的权利
Mirandize her.

29
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:11,058
如果鲍尔把我们和朱玛联系起来的话
If Bauer connects us to Juma,

30
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:13,009
这次行动就会严重受阻
it could seriously impede this operation.

31
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:15,009
是的  没错
Yes,it could.

32
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,009
货能按时送到吗
Is the shipment on time?

33
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,099
能  一个小时内到港
Yes. Due into port in the next hour.

34
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:21,036
一旦武器部署完毕
Once the weapons are deployed,

35
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:24,087
鲍尔或是其他人知不知道都无所谓了
then it doesn't matter what Mr. Bauer or anyone else knows.

36
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:26,053
我没杀伯内特
I didn't kill Burnett.

37
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,057
是这个家伙杀的
This man did.

38
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:28,090
他叫约翰·奎恩
His name is John Quinn.

39
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:30,087
他为斯塔克伍德卖命
He works for Starkwood.

40
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:33,007
那斯塔克伍德和这一切有什么关联
And what does Starkwood have to do with this?

41
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:35,028
你的线人声称斯塔克伍德企图
Your informant claims that Starkwood was trying

42
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:37,061
获得生化武器  这就能联系上朱玛了
to acquire a bioweapon,and that's your connection to Juma.

43
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:39,008
你在过去这半年来一直在试图
You've been trying to dismantle Starkwood

44
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,061
解散斯塔克伍德公司
for the last six months.

45
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,088
他们要是有这种武器
If they have a weapon like this,

46
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,075
你最好相信他们有使用它的企图
you better believe they intend to use it.

47
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,039
不要
No!

48
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,003
告诉我那些武器会从哪里入境
Just tell me where the weapons are coming in.

49
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,029
太迟了
You're too late.

50
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:56,073
武器已经运到了
They're already here.

51
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,073
以下情节发生在晚间10点至11点间
The following takes place between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m.

52
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,097
长官
Sir?

53
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,074
对现场的初步调查已经结束
Preliminary sweep of the immediate area's done.

54
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:41,074
没有鲍尔的踪迹
There's no sign of Bauer.

55
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:43,024
好吧  扩大搜捕范围
All right,widen the grid.

56
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:45,028
还得去查看封锁线周边的摄像监控
And run down security cameras around the perimeter

57
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:47,011
-一定有人看到了他  -是  长官
- Witness or somebody must have seen him.  - Yes,sir.

58
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:02,030
卡宁先生
Mr.Kanin?

59
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:05,030
请讲
Yes?

60
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:07,010
拉里·莫斯想和您通话
Larry Moss is on the line.

61
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:08,077
莫斯探员
Agent Moss,

62
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:11,041
拜托告诉我你已经拘禁了杰克·鲍尔
please tell me you have Jack Bauer in custody.

63
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:15,031
我也希望如此  卡宁先生  但事实是
I wish that were the case,Mr. Kanin,but the truth is...

64
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:19,091
先生  是参议员迈尔
Sir,it's senator Mayer.

65
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,068
他遇害了
He's dead.

66
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,055
什么
What?!

67
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:25,015
他在自己家中被杀了
He was murdered at his house.

68
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:28,052
我们只发现了鲍尔刚才来过这里
We only found out that Bauer was on his way over here a short time ago.

69
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:29,069
不幸的是  我们来迟了一步
Unfortunately,we got here too late.

70
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,086
等等
Wait a minute.

71
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:33,019
你是说
Are you telling me

72
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:36,030
杰克·鲍尔杀了一位美国议员吗
that jack bauer just killed a United States senator?

73
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,070
这只是假设  我们仍在调查  先生
That's the assumption that we're working under,yes,Sir.

74
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:43,034
你们怎么能让这种事发生  莫斯探员
How could you have let this happen，Agent Moss?!

75
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,044
他耍了我们所有人  先生
He had us all fooled,sir.

76
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:48,001
我把杰克·鲍尔交由你看管
I released Jack Bauer into your custody!

77
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,068
我叫你看紧点儿他
I ordered you to keep him on a short leash!

78
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,069
不  卡宁先生  你别把这一切
No,no. Mr. Kanin,you are not

79
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,064
都怪在我头上
gonna lay this one on my feet.

80
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:55,023
是你同意让鲍尔审问伯内特的
It was your decision to give Bauer access to Burnett.

81
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:58,042
当时我还反对来着
I advised you against it.

82
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,046
卡宁先生
Mr. Kanin?

83
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,010
抱歉
I'm sorry. Uh,

84
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:10,016
你刚说什么来着
What did you say?

85
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:14,053
我刚说  当时我还反对来着
I said,I advised you against it.

86
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,037
是的  你说过
Yes, you did.

87
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:22,008
先生  我的人还在搜查该区域
Sir,I have teams sweeping the area.

88
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:24,024
找到他  莫斯探员
Just find him,Agent Moss.

89
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,078
是  我会的
Yeah,I will.

90
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,080
斯塔克伍德和今天发生的一切都有关联
Starkwood was involved with everything that happened today.

91
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,066
是他们协助朱玛一伙
They were the ones that helped Juma and his men

92
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,044
撞毁飞机并袭击白宫
bring down those planes and attack the White House.

93
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:54,037
作为交换  他们获准在桑加拉
In exchange,they were allowed to develop

94
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,060
研发并生产大规模杀伤性武器
and manufacture a WMD in Sangala.

95
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,074
是种生化武器
It's a bioweapon.

96
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:59,068
显然  这种武器现在已在美国
Apparently,it's already here in the U.S.

97
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:00,088
还有谁知道这些
Who else knows about this?

98
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,002
没了  迈尔参议员和我
No one. Senator Mayer and I

99
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,016
正在对这些信息抽丝剥茧
were piecing together the information

100
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,039
然后他就被杀了
right before he was killed.

101
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,089
你说武器已经在这儿了
You said the weapon's already here.

102
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:07,059
已经在他们手上了吗
Are they in possession of it?

103
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,044
应该还没有  我从他们手下的手机里
I don't think so. The text message I got

104
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:10,095
获取的短信显示
off their agent's cell phone said,

105
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:13,096
亚历山大港  下午3点
"port of alexandria,15 p.m."

106
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:15,010
我们为什么不把这事报告给调查局
Why don't we just call the FBI

107
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,016
让他们封锁整个地区
and lock the whole place down?

108
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,033
咱俩可都是逃犯  托尼
Because we're fugitives,Tony.

109
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,063
谁会信咱们
No one's going to believe us.

110
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,060
咱得先查明那批武器的确切位置
We need to know exactly where that weapon is

111
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,094
然后才能通知他们赶来
before we call anyone else in.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,044
托尼  你得告诉我你是否愿意跟我干
Tony,I need to know if you're with me on this.

113
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:27,007
好吧  我跟你干
Yeah,I'm with you.

114
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:28,098
好  我们在港口北端见
Okay. Meet me at the north end of the port.

115
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,068
从主入口前面那条路进来
There's an access road right before the main entrance.

116
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:33,031
好  我马上就到
All right,I'll be there.

117
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:38,049
都结束了
It's over.

118
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:41,002
杜巴库和朱玛都死了
Dubaku and Juma are dead.

119
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,043
那些发动恐怖袭击的人
Everyone responsible for the terrorist attacks...

120
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:48,070
还有害死我儿罗杰的恶贼都被一网打尽
responsible for Roger.

121
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:52,053
感谢上帝
Thank god for that.

122
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,034
还有  还有些事
And there's... there's something else.

123
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,097
不幸中的万幸
Something good that's come out of all of this.

124
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:02,078
奥利维亚和我都在白宫
Olivia is here at the white house.

125
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,034
奥利维亚
Olivia?

126
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,061
她回到我们身边了  亨利
She's come home,Henry.

127
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:12,022
这场危机让咱一家再次凝聚在了一起
The crisis-- it brought us together.

128
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,062
我已让她留下做特别顾问了
I've asked her to stay on as special advisor,and-and

129
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,009
她也答应了
She's agreed.

130
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:19,019
艾莉
Ally...

131
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:23,000
我都说不出  有多开心
I can't begin to tell you how happy that makes me.

132
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:26,000
我也是
Me,too.

133
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:28,024
亲爱的  我知道你累了
Sweetheart,i know that you're tired.

134
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,000
好好休息吧
You should get some rest.

135
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,054
只要一有时间
Olivia and i will come to the hospital

136
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,014
奥利维亚和我会去医院看你的
Just as soon as we can.

137
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,018
好啊
When you can.

138
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:39,005
我哪儿也不去  在这等你们
I'm not going anywhere.

139
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:42,032
告诉奥利维亚我爱她
Give Olivia my love.

140
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,005
我爱你
Love you.

141
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,015
我们也爱你
We love you,too.

142
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:57,053
医生说他可以完全康复的
The doctors expect him to make a full recovery.

143
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,004
亨利比我们想象的  要坚强得多
Henry's a lot tougher than anyone thought.

144
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:05,010
希望如此  希望如此
Oh,maybe,maybe,maybe,just maybe,

145
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:08,018
希望结局会皆大欢喜
This day will end on a positive note.

146
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,042
怎么了  伊桑  出什么事了
What is it,ethan? what's wrong?

147
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:22,099
很遗憾地告知您  总统阁下
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,madam president,

148
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:25,063
迈尔参议员死了
But senator mayer is dead.

149
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,009
怎么回事
What happened?

150
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:32,020
所有证据都表明
All evidence points to the fact that he was murdered

151
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:33,080
他是被杰克·鲍尔谋杀的
By jack bauer.

152
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:35,087
鲍尔
Bauer?

153
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:38,021
我知道这让人难以置信
It's hard to believe,i know.

154
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:40,007
说不通啊
It-it doesn't make any sense.

155
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:42,040
今天他为我们立下汗马功劳
After everything He has done today,

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,098
怎么还会杀迈尔参议员呢
Why on earth would he do this?

157
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:49,088
找到他  就会真相大白了
We'll know more when we find him.

158
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,088
天哪
My god.

159
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:56,079
总统阁下
Madam president,

160
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:58,069
鉴于所发生的一切
In light of what's happened,

161
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:01,039
为了维护您本届政府的利益
And for the sake of your administration,

162
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:04,046
恐怕我只能辞去联席参谋长一职了
I'm afraid i have no choice but to resign as your chief of staff.

163
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:05,063
伊桑
Ethan!

164
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,040
总统阁下  您听我说
Madam president,please,you need to hear this.

165
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:13,034
是我下令解禁鲍尔
Inevitably,it'll come to light that i sanctioned

166
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,048
不可避免  此事终究会被曝光的
Bauer's release from custody.

167
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:19,081
除非我立即辞职
Unless i step down immediately,

168
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:22,015
否则这对您的政府和您个人
The damage to your office,and you personally,

169
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:26,049
都将会造成巨大的伤害
Will be extensive.

170
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,076
伊桑  奥利维亚今天已封锁了这个消息
Ethan,Olivia has already killed this story once today.

171
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:32,033
我们可以控制事态蔓延
We can control the damage.

172
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,053
不
No.

173
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,013
现在就算是奥利维亚也无能为力
No,not even Olivia can control it now.

174
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,003
参议员被谋杀之后就不可能了
Not after the senator's murder.

175
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:46,084
总统阁下  事实上
The truth is,madam president,

176
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:50,014
我没能竭尽所能地保护您
I didn't do enough to protect you.

177
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:52,075
事实是  我辜负了您
The truth is,i failed you.

178
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:56,042
我应该为这些后果负责
And i should shoulder the blame for what's happened.

179
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:58,099
伊桑  说真的  你
Ethan,really,you're...

180
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,039
你想的太多了
You're taking this too far.

181
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:02,039
是吗
Am i?

182
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:03,089
我不确定
I'm not so sure.

183
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,033
因为您女儿曾经非常明确地表明
As your daughter has made abundantly clear,

184
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,070
我对此事负有不可推卸的责任
I have a lot to answer for.

185
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:15,040
对我而言  你只是一名优秀的顾问
You have done nothing but be an invaluable advisor to me

186
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,087
更是我的好友
And an even better friend.

187
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:18,067
总统阁下  很感激您能这么说
I appreciate you saying that,Madam president,

188
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:22,071
但是奥利维亚是对的
but Olivia's right.

189
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:25,065
早晚会有人借此兴风作浪
The political knives will be out.

190
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:28,062
我所做出的每个决定将会被审查
Every decision i've made will be scrutinized.

191
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:32,075
将由独立检察官介入此事
There will be calls for a special prosecutor.

192
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:39,009
您是位伟大的女性  艾莉森
You're a great woman,Allison.

193
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:44,003
还有未竟的伟业要您去完成
You have great work yet to do.

194
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,077
我现在是您的累赘
I'm a liability to you now.

195
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:52,057
别让我成为您今后三年政治生涯的绊脚石
Don't let me compromise your next three years in office.

196
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:56,044
别让我拖累您的工作
Don't let me sink your agenda.

197
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:58,081
是我们的工作  伊桑
Our agenda,ethan.

198
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:05,015
对啊
Yes.

199
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,025
我们的工作
Our agenda.

200
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:13,029
相信我  总统阁下
Trust me,madam president,

201
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:16,076
这么做没错
It's the right thing to do.

202
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,083
请接受我的辞职
Accept my resignation.

203
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:35,078
明早我会递交辞呈
I'll have a letter on your desk in the morning.

204
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:53,090
他们随时会到
They're gonna be here any minute.

205
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,074
我们得缩小搜索范围
We need to narrow down the search.

206
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,014
如果他们今天卸货  货应该还在码头
If they offloaded it today, It should still be on the storage dock.

207
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:01,027
杰克  那照样是大海捞针
That's still a needle in a haystack,jack.

208
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:02,091
那边有上千个集装箱
There must be over a thousand containers in there.

209
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:05,006
我们得拿到那里的载货单
We need to access the yard's manifest.

210
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,023
那边安保措施怎么样
What's the security?

211
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:10,018
-我发现了一个港务局警察  -就一个人
- I've spotted one port authority officer. - That's it?

212
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,092
就一个人
That's it.

213
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:13,035
应该还有其他人
There's got to be more.

214
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,075
走
Come on,let's go.

215
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,052
亲爱的  不会有事的
Honey,it'll be fine.

216
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,026
再过几小时就有人来换班了
I get relieved in a few hours.

217
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,069
卡尔  你知道我不愿让你连上两个班
Carl,you know i don't like you working double shifts.

218
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:23,043
是我自己选的嘛
Well,it was my choice.

219
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,001
更何况  加班费可以补贴家用
And we could use the overtime.

220
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:26,060
女儿们怎么样
How are the girls?

221
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,093
整晚在我肚子里乱踢呢
Kicking like a chorus line tonight.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,090
她们都想爸爸了
They miss their daddy.

223
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:31,027
医生怎么说
What'd the doctor say?

224
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:33,001
还好我怀的不是三胞胎
That i'm lucky it's not triplets.

225
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,061
亲爱的  我再打给你
Honey,let me call you back.

226
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:12,024
别想拿枪
Don't even think about going for your weapon.

227
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,088
我要港口的卸货单  在哪儿
I need the port's manifest. where is it?

228
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,088
我只是个港务局警察
I am just the p.a. cop

229
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,009
在哪儿
Where is it?

230
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,026
在海关
Customs house.

231
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:25,063
那边
That way.

232
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,003
走
Let's go.

233
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:42,034
准时到了吗
We're on schedule?

234
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,030
我们正在靠近港口的集结地  先生
We're at the staging area near the port,sir,

235
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,074
不过我们还在等奎恩
but we're still waiting on Quinn.

236
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:47,018
他现在应该已经到了
He should have been there by now.

237
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,041
有他的消息吗
Have you heard from him?

238
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:50,041
给他打了电话  但是没人接
We've tried his cell,but he's not answering.

239
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:54,012
如果鲍尔杀了奎恩
If Bauer took out Quinn,

240
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:56,012
他就有可能知道了这次行动
He might have knowledge of the operation.

241
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,072
对吗
Mightn't he?

242
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,079
要我们撤退吗  先生
Should we stand down,sir?

243
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:03,073
不  再等奎恩5分钟
No. give Quinn five more minutes,

244
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,063
到时再行动
Then go in.

245
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,070
要极其谨慎行事
Do so with extreme caution

246
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:10,007
等你们把集装箱拿到手之后
Then contact me the minute

247
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:11,054
马上联系我
That you've secured the container.

248
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,007
是的  先生
Yes,sir.

249
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:15,047
董事会成员都到了  先生
Everybody on the board is here,sir.

250
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:18,071
你愁容满面的  格雷格
You have a worried look,Greg.

251
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,091
气氛很紧张  先生
It's very tense in there,sir.

252
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:23,008
他们好对付  格雷格
They're six-year-olds,Greg.

253
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:25,048
只要有的吃就好
And they need to eat their carrots.

254
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:34,033
道格
Doug

255
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:38,050
漫长的一天  对美国来说真是漫长的一天
Rough day. A rough day for the United States of America.

256
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:40,040
白宫遇袭被围
The White House under siege,

257
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:42,017
总统被劫持为人质
The president taken hostage...

258
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:43,037
尤其痛苦的是
It's especially painful

259
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:44,077
我们知道这一切本没必要发生
Because we know this didn't have to be.

260
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,067
事实上  美国军队
In fact, the United States Military

261
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:50,044
已经到了崩溃的边缘
Is strained to the breaking point.

262
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:53,064
事实上  恢复公司职能的草案
In fact, Reinstatement of the draft

263
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:56,051
也因为政治原因不予讨论
Is off the table for political reasons.

264
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:58,027
事实上  这间屋里坐着的人  
In fact, the people in this room,

265
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:02,095
你们都掌控着西半球最大的私人军队
you all control the largest private army in the western hemisphere.

266
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:05,016
那么  难道我们今天没有用武之地了吗
Now,could we have been of help today?

267
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:08,036
我们当然有用武之地的
You bet your ass we could've been of help!

268
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:10,003
但他们并没有找我们  是吧
But they didn't call us,did they?

269
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,000
相反
No. instead,

270
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:14,003
我们坐着无所事事  我们的合同被取消了
We sit here,our contracts are canceled,

271
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,002
我们的士兵被无视  我们的公司主权
Our soldiers' vilified,our corporate sovereignty

272
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,020
也受到了国会法令的威胁
Is threatened by congressional fiat.

273
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:21,061
道格  是你牵头与政府签订了协议
Doug,you brokered the deal with this government.

274
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,044
但你目光短浅
You were short-sighted

275
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:25,001
政府并不明白  全球反恐战争
And they don't understand that the global war

276
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:28,025
只能依靠我们这样的部队来取得胜利
On terror can only be won by forces like ours.

277

所以从现在开始
So as of this minute,we sit

278
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:31,085
我们不再提供证词

279

我们不再提供相关文件

I don't even want us to take any phone calls.

281
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:36,052
你叫我们来就是想要说这个
Is that what this is about?

282
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,092
-为了国家的安全  -你就是想说这个
- With the security of our country,  - Is that what this is about?

283
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,062
我们可承受不了公司被他们搞垮的风险
We cannot afford to let them take us down.

284
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,006
你就是想说这个
Is that what this is about then?

285
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,023
你来这里
You came here

286
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,070
叫董事们冒着被联邦政府起诉的风险
To ask the board to risk a federal indictment?

287
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:49,050
你这样不行的  乔纳斯
It won't work,Jonas.

288
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:51,017
我们和政府达成了协议
We got a deal.

289
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,017
这协议不错  对我们来说是幸事
It's a good deal and we're lucky to have it.

290
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,057
跟想要毁掉我们的政府达成协议

292
00:14:58,008 --> 00:15:00,018
不行  今时不同往日
No,it's all different now.

293
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,035
是时候改变一下游戏规则了
Today was a game-changer.

294
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,038
不行  从制度上来说
No,institutionally,

295
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,058
我们要按传票上说的做

文件也上交了

00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:09,022
不再这样做了
Not anymore.

299
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,049
乔纳斯  我们必须跟政府合作
Jonas,we have to stay engaged with this administration.

300
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:14,026
不  道格
no,we don't,Doug.

301
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,003
此事我们可以通过商谈消除分歧
You and i can talk this out.

302
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,045
如果大家还有其他问题
If you guys have any questions,any further questions,

303
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:20,050
格雷格  你留在这里回答他们的问题

道格  你这样做不对的

你必须承认这点

308
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,038
也许吧  但你我都知道
Maybe. but you and i both know

309
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:38,075
斯塔克伍德若全力反对小组委员会
That starkwood cannot survive

310
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,072
是没好果子吃的
An all-out war against the subcommittee.

311
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:42,075
这个  我来操心好了
Let me worry about that.

312
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,096
不  你应该操心的是参议员迈尔
No,you should worry about senator Mayer.

313
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:46,086
他是不会善罢甘休的
He's not going to let go of this.

314
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,026
他紧咬着不放
He's got his teeth in it.

315

迈尔参议员已经死了

316
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,037
很不幸  就在近一个小时前
He was killed by a rogue federal agent

317
00:15:55,043 --> 00:15:57,077
他被一个身为联邦探员的无赖杀死了
Not one hour ago,tragically.

318
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,007
乔纳斯
Jonas.

319
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:10,065
告诉我你跟这件事没关系
Tell me you had nothing to do with this.

320
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:14,089
你是在指责我  合谋参与了
Are you accusing me of complicity

321
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:17,025
迈尔参议员的谋杀吗

322
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:19,076
我要你亲口告诉我

323
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:26,013
政治暗杀可不是斯塔克伍德的业务  道格
Starkwood is not in the business of political assassination,Doug.

324
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,057
但或许我们可以研究研究
Though maybe we should look into it.

325

西非那里可没有深水港
There's no deepwater port in that area of West Africa.

330
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:52,009
如果武器是从那里来的

必须经陆路运到刚果港口城市黑角
It would've had to overland into Pointe-Noire.

Where...  [Port of Pointe-Noire-Congo]

339
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:18,095
警官  怎么称呼
What's your name,officer?

340
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,015

卡尔  你仔细听我说

344
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,019
今早策划两架飞机相撞

正试图获得大规模杀伤性武器

他们马上就要来拿那些武器了
They're coming here to pick up that weapon.

348
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,097
武器就装在外面码头的某个集装箱里
It's somewhere out there in your yard in one of those canisters.

349
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:38,059
听着  我知道这或许让你难以相信

不  实际上不无可能

你时间不多了

352
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:43,024
此话怎讲
What do you mean?

353
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,004
他们是要来
They are coming.

354
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:46,048
事实上  他们应该已经到了
In fact,they should be here already.

355
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:48,018
继续说  卡尔
Keep talking,Carl.

356
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,015
他们告诉我
They told me they were smuggling in

357
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,048
他们从南韩走私过来一批电子产品

我完全不知道他们是恐怖分子

360
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,002
那你答应帮他们做什么
What'd you agree to do for them?

361
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,075
打开前门  就当什么都没看见
Open the front gate. look the other way.

362
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:59,099
仅仅这样吗
Is that it?

363
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,026
关闭监视器
Disable the security cameras.

364
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,066
这么大的场地应该有更多的警员看守

365

他给谁打电话
Who's he calling?

371
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:15,044
联邦调查局  既然现在我们确认

把皮带系上
Put your belt back on.

387
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,095
我要你回到岗位上
I want you to resume your post.

388
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:03,059
假装若无其事
Pretend like everything's normal.

389
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,016
-把他们放进来  -然后呢
- Just let them in. - And then what?

390
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:06,099
他们一拿到集装箱  我们就会跟踪他们

一旦过了信号屏蔽区

-我们就会打电话给当局  -我不确定

什么叫你不确定
What do you mean you don't know?

394
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,003
你脱不了干系  卡尔
You're a part of this,Carl,

395
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,057
这可由不得你
Whether you want to be or not.

396
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:17,067
当你答应他们的时候
You became a part of it this the second you said

397
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,044
-你就已经上了贼船了  -杰克

401

Carl,if you don't open that gate,they're going

402
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,011

To come in here looking for you,you understand me?

403
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:34,038
我这么跟你说吧

These men have killed over 300 people today.

405
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,062
如果他们拿到这些武器

406
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:41,096
再去杀人就易如反掌
They're going to make that look like child's play.

407

I promise you.

413
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,018
好吧
Okay.

414
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:08,089
托尼  把监听装置拿过来
Tony,get the surveillance package.

415
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:10,042
别担心
Don't worry.

416
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:12,006
这样我们就能听监听实况
It's just so we can hear what's going on.

417
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,036
转过来
Turn around.

418
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:17,059
我得把这个放在你背后
I need to put this on your back.

419
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:20,006
听着  关于那些钱
Listen,the money-- it wasn't about

420
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,023
不是因为我贪财
Greed or anything.

421
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,070
只是我妻子  琳达  她要生双胞胎了
It's my wife,Linda. she's having twins.

422
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:26,094
这是最天经地义的事了  对吗
They say it's the most natural thing in the world,right?

423
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,011
怀孕
Getting pregnant?

424
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,014
我们花了三年时间
Well,it took us three years,

425
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,044
付出了太多的代价
Cost an arm and a leg.

426
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:35,081
我不是找借口  但生育保险费简直太少了
No excuses,but insurance doesn't cover a dime.

427
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:37,061
我只是太想有个完整的家庭
I just always wanted to have a family.

428
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:39,002
你们能理解吗
You know what i mean?

429
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:41,008
把这个揣进口袋
Put this in your pocket.

430
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:42,099
能收到吗
You got him?

431
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:44,086
能
Yeah.

432
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:53,016
记住  就把这当成跟平常上班一样
Remember,it's just another day at the office.

433
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:55,040
你不会有事的
You're going to be fine.

434
00:20:56,043 --> 00:20:57,077
走吧
Let's go.

435
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,001
卡尔  你怎么才来
What took you so long,Carl?

436
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:22,055
带了通行文件了吗
You got the routing documents?

437
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:24,022
当然
Sure.

438
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,012
我得看一下 以确定集装箱的位置
I need to see them in order to locate the container.

439
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,039
行了  卡尔  就在这儿呢
Relax,Carl. they're right here.

440
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:33,053
好吧
Okay.

441
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,073
中部
Center section.

442
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,007
36排Q区
Row 36,Q-block.

443
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:41,007
就在你右手边的第四个货堆里面
It's that fourth stack on your right.

444
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:44,039
我知道集装箱在哪  卡尔
I know where the container is,Carl.

445
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,004
你把监控摄像头都关了吗
Did you disable the security cameras?

446
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,058
只留了10点钟方向的那个
um,all but one else on 10 o'clock,

447
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:49,098
照你说的做了
Just like you said.

448
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:54,038
你妻子还好吧
How's your wife?

449
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,062
她很好
She's fine.

450
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,037
你没告诉她这件事  是吧
You didn't tell her anything about this,did you?

451
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,019
没有  当然没有
No,of course not.

452
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:04,036
你还告诉过别人吗
Did you tell anybody else?

453
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:05,096
没有  我干嘛要告诉别人呢
No,no,why would i?

454
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:07,099
你说呢  卡尔
You tell me,Carl.

455
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:11,090
你怎么突然这么紧张了呢
Why are you so nervous?

456
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:15,054
好吧  你想知道真相是吧  斯多克斯
Okay,um,you want to know the truth,Mr. Stokes?

457
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,081
我以为你们就是单纯过来取东西
Uh... i was expecting a simple pickup,

458
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,054
但是看见你
But you show up

459
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:22,091
-带着这么多人过来  然后  -然后怎样
- With a small army here,and,um... - And what?

460
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:26,095
只是  出乎我的意料  仅此而已
It's just... not w-what i was expecting,that's all.

461
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:29,022
我只是不想被抓到
I just don't want to get caught.

462
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:33,032
没人会被抓到的 卡尔
Nobody's gonna get caught,Carl.

463
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,079
走吧  出发
Let's go,we're moving.

464
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,099
你也一起  卡尔  上车
You too,Carl,take a ride.

465
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:39,026
跟你说了是在左边第四个货堆里面
I told you,it's the fourth stack on your left.

466
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,036
36排Q区
Q-block,Row 36.

467
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:41,073
我还是想让你帮我们带路
I'd feel better if you showed us.

468
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,052
我真的应该守在这  斯多克斯先生
I really should stay here,Mr. Stokes.

469
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:45,032
我还要完成巡逻任务呢
I got to finish my patrol.

470
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:47,007
为什么  卡尔  你在等人吗
Why,Carl? You expecting somebody?

471
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:49,027
-没有  -那就上车
- No. - Then get in.

472
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,067
好吧
Okay.

473
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:01,008
该死
Damn it.

474
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:03,055
算了吧  杰克
Forget about him,Jack.

475
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:05,062
他出那扇门时就注定会死
He was dead the minute he stepped out that door.

476
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:08,056
你我都心知肚明
You and i both know that.

477
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:29,051
伊桑  我来是想说我很抱歉
Ethan,i just came to say how sorry i am.

478
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:32,061
出于真心  还是出于礼节  
Well,i appreciate the courtesy

479
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:34,035
我都谢谢你的好意
if not the sincerity.

480
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:39,012
尽管我觉得我这样做  对我母亲最好
As much as i may feel this is what's best for my mother,

481
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,003
但就我个人而言
On a personal level

482
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,022
我很抱歉让你承受这些
I'm sorry you have to go through this...

483
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,072
还有我不应该在气头上
And for some of the harsher things

484
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,066
对你说那么刻薄的话
I said to you in anger.

485
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:51,023
恐怕我也要向你道歉
Well,i suppose i owe you an apology,too,

486
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:55,032
我不该把这次因我错信鲍尔
For accusing you of leaking my role

487
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:58,010
而铸成大错一事的曝光  怪在你头上
in this Bauer fiasco to the press.

488
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:01,065
我曾深信你一直在暗算我
I really believed you were trying to blindside me.

489
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:04,041
鉴于我给你的印象  我倒不觉得奇怪
Considering the impression i gave you,i'm not surprised.

490
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:08,005
奥利维亚
Olivia,

491
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:11,018
我是看着你长大的
As someone who's known you most of your life,

492
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:13,019
给你提点建议吧
I'd like to offer some advice.

493
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:15,022
请讲
Of course.

494
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:24,052
在华盛顿  有雄心壮志是优秀品质
Ambition can be a valuable quality here in washington

495
00:24:24,052 --> 00:24:26,080
在生活中也是一样
As well as in life,

496
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:30,021
但若不加遏制  即便不酿成大错
But unchecked,it can be unhealthy,

497
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,040
也会后患无穷
if not dangerous.

498
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:33,091
我想说的是
What i'm trying to say is...

499
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:37,074
你已在总统身边占有一席之地
You got yourself a seat at the president's table.

500
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:40,081
她听信于你
She listens to you.

501
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,008
但掌管国家政权绝对不像
But running a country is not like running

502
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,005
参加竞选那么简单
A campaign.

503
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:49,076
其目的不是不惜一切代价获胜
It's not about doing whatever it takes to win.

504
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:53,026
而是为全体美国人民做出正确的决定
It's about doing what's right for the American people.

505
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,013
有时候二者可以两全其美
Sometimes those things aren't mutually exclusive.

506
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:07,084
那么
Well...

507
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:11,038
再见了  奥利维亚
Good-bye,Olivia.

508
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:13,045
再见
Good-bye.

509
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:27,063
喂
Hello.

510
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,003
我是奥利维亚
It's Olivia.

511
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,036
你可以报导这件事了  肯  情况有好转
You can go with that story now,ken,and it just got better.

512
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:33,047
说吧
Tell me.

513
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,040
伊桑·卡宁辞职了
Ethan Kanin's resigning.

514
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,040
为什么
What happened?

515
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:37,077
我们不是计划好了
I thought the plan was to let him twist

516
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:38,094
要慢慢折磨他吗
In the wind for a while.

517
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,027
他是被逼之下才出此下策
His hand was forced.

518
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:44,028
貌似是因为杰克·鲍尔刚杀了迈尔参议员
It seems Jack Bauer just murdered senator Mayer.

519
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,068
你说什么
What?

520
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:47,085
你不是逗我玩吧
You're kidding me.

521
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,032
还有别人知道这件事吗
Anybody else have this yet?

522
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,095
没有  11点的新闻给你独家报导
not yet.It's all yours in time of the 11 o'clock.

523
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:53,082
我说过会关照你  没错吧
Told you i'd take care of you,didn't i?

524
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:56,035
你对我太好了  奥利维亚
You are too good to me,Olivia.

525
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:57,086
你只管把你答应过的事办好就行
You just hold up your end.

526
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:59,086
务必让卡宁来背黑锅
Make sure Kanin's the fall guy.

527
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,073
我妈与此毫不相干  明白了吗
My mother is nowhere near this,understand?

528
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,020
没问题
No problem.

529
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,087
她真的不知道你是走露消息的人吗
She really doesn't have any idea that you're the leak?

530
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:08,003
对  最好别让她知道
No,and it'd better stay that way.

531
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:11,007
我不会向她透露半个字
She won't hear it from me.

532
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:13,054
你承诺过的晚餐  想好什么时候了吗
When are we having that dinner you promised?

533
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:16,041
下周吧
Maybe next week.

534
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,068
你总是推到下周
It's always next week.

535
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,058
去干活吧  还有那个直播要做呢
You'd better get to work if you're going to make that broadcast.

536
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,002
这是初步弹道分析
preliminary  ballistics.

537
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:41,058
电脑上的这些文件
So these files on the computer--

538
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:44,018
你认为迈尔被杀前  正在看它们吗
Presumably senator Mayer was looking at 'em before he was killed?

539
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:45,098
至少有人在看  长官
Someone was,sir.

540
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:47,072
过去一个小时有人打开看了这些文件
They were opened and viewed within the last hour.

541
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:51,026
如果说  
So if the sen...

542
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,010
参议员是在大厅入口被正面射杀
If the senator was killed point-blank in the entry hall,

543
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,073
为什么门框和栏杆上会有残留的子弹头
how are we explaining the slugs in the door frame and the railing?

544
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,090
还不清楚  长官
I don't know,sir.

545
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:00,080
让鉴证组的人检查一下
Get the crime lab guys on it.

546
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:02,087
是  长官
Yes,sir.

547
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:19,018
沃克探员  拉里·莫斯找你
Agent Walker,it's Larry Moss for you.

548
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:22,015
请讲
Hello.

549
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:24,009
迈尔参议员死了
Senator Mayer is dead.

550
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:26,080
杰克在哪
Where's Jack?

551
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,056
还不知道  我们没有抓住他
Don't know; we don't have him.

552
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:33,040
好吧  你是不是又认为是杰克干的  拉里
Okay,but what,you think that he did this,Larry?

553
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,097
先杀了伯内特然后又是迈尔吗
First Burnett and now Mayer?

554
00:27:36,043 --> 00:27:37,072
看起来是这样
It looks that way.

555
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,027
什么意思
What do you mean "looks that way"?

556
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,024
这就是我打电话给你的原因
Well,that's why i'm calling. senator Mayer

557
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:44,083
迈尔是被一支UMP40冲锋枪射杀的
Was killed with a UMP 40 submachine gun.

558
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:47,028
鲍尔现在在逃  他从哪弄来的这种武器
If bauer was on the run, where'd he get ahold of a weapon like that?

559
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:49,061
而且现场证据也表明
Also,there's evidence to suggest that the,uh--

560
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,005
迈尔被杀的时候
There was a third party in the house

561
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:53,059
-有第三方在场  -什么证据
- When the senator was killed. - What kind of evidence?

562
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:57,059
奇怪的弹痕  被撞坏的法式玻璃门
Unexplained slugs... ...a broken set of french doors,

563
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,054
被挪动的椅子
A chair where it doesn't belong.

564
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,081
也就是说  是别人杀了迈尔
Okay,so are you saying that this third party killed Mayer?

565
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,080
蕾妮  我是想说如果我一开始就
Well,you know,Renee, I might be saying that if i knew what the hell

566
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:06,090
知道鲍尔在这干嘛就好了
Bauer was doing here in the first place.

567
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:08,023
好吧  蕾妮  听着
All right,Renee,listen.

568
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,060
我真的想有个折中办法
I want to meet you halfway,i do,

569
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,037
但是  如果你希望我也认为
But if you expect me to even entertain

570
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:14,010
鲍尔是无辜的  你就要帮帮我呀
Bauer's innocence,you have got to help me here.

571
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,074
不行  拉里  杰克既然仍在暗中调查
I can't,larry. If Jack is still underground,

572
00:28:15,081 --> 00:28:17,047
肯定是有他的原因的
He is underground for a reason.

573
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:20,004
迈尔的电脑上
There were files open on Mayer's computer--

574
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:22,098
有打开的关于斯塔克伍德的调查资料
Documents relating to his investigation into starkwood.

575
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,078
你告诉我这个  告诉我这个就行
All right,so just tell me that,tell me that.

576
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,032
鲍尔和你提到过斯塔克伍德吗
Did starkwood ever come up in your conversation with Bauer?

577
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:36,009
蕾妮
Renee.

578
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:40,060
我知道  我应该早点相信你
Look,maybe,maybe I should have trusted you before,okay,

579
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:44,024
但是你现在也要相信我
But you have got to trust me now.

580
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,037
斯塔克伍德到底在扮演什么角色
What role does starkwood play in all this?

581
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:58,041
陷害鲍尔谋杀了伯内特的人叫约翰·奎恩
The man who framed Jack for burnett's murder was John Quinn,

582
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,063
他是斯达克伍德的一个雇佣兵
a starkwood contractor.

583
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:02,057
杰克认为他们是朱玛一伙的帮凶
Jack believes that they were behind Juma

584
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:04,072
也是今天所有恐怖袭击的幕后黑手
And all of the terrorist attacks today.

585
00:29:04,072 --> 00:29:06,046
杰克到迈尔那边取证
He went to Mayer to get the evidence to prove it.

586
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:09,086
可能奎恩跟踪他到了那里
I have to assume that Quinn followed him there.

587
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:12,004
我只知道这些  拉里  真的
That's all that I know,Larry,I swear.

588
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:14,010
好吧  我相信你
Okay,I believe you.

589
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:15,020
谢谢
Thank you.

590
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:18,089
你就待在那  我很快会再联络你
Just sit tight,I'll be in touch soon.

591
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,069
让我去帮忙吧   杰克仍在孤军奋战
Well,let me help,Larry. I mean,Jack could still be out there.

592
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:22,043
他有可能遇到了麻烦
He may be in trouble.

593
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:24,065
不  我现在还不能放你  还不是时候
No,no,i can't release you,not yet.

594
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:40,006
瑞斯  怎么样了
Reese,what's the status?

595
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:42,067
集装箱底盘已准备好了  我马上就过去
Just getting the chassis on,sir,I'll be a minute.

596
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,067
快点
Hurry it up.

597
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:48,074
稳住  稳住  车还没来
Hold up,hold up,I don't have my truck.

598
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,079
放那  放那  就放那里
Put it down there,i want it there.

599
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:06,092
米契  上去
Mitch,get up there.

600
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:08,024
现在开始检测
Let's run a diagnostic now.

601
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:10,015
瑞斯的拖车一到  马上就走
I want to be ready to roll as soon as Reese gets here with that flatbed.

602
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:11,070
是  长官
Yes,sir.

603
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:24,077
好  货在那里
All right,there's the package.

604
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:26,020
我们应该回到车上
We should get back to the car.

605
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,067
一旦他们行动
We want to be in position

606
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,063
我们就找好位置跟踪集装箱
to follow that container,once they move out.

607
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:34,063
杰克
Jack.

608
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:36,088
等一会
Just give me one second.

609
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,018
库柏
Cooper.

610
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:41,055
是时候给卡尔结账了
Now's as good a time as any to settle up with Carl.

611
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:42,073
是  长官
Yes,sir.

612
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:43,079
谢谢  卡尔
Thanks,Carl.

613
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:46,029
祝你好运
Good luck.

614
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:48,088
我们走
Let's go.

615
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:49,099
去哪
Where we going?

616
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:53,068
钱在卡车里  就隔开一个过道  来吧
Your money's in my truck,just one aisle over.Come on.

617
00:30:56,094 --> 00:30:58,080
杰克  我们该行动了
Jack,we should get going.

618
00:30:58,087 --> 00:30:59,094
不
No.

619
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:12,032
这是去哪  你不是说  到卡车那拿钱吗
What are you doing? I thought you said the money was in the truck.

620
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:17,067
你到底要干嘛
What the hell's going on?

621
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:19,016
往前走
Just keep moving.

622
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:22,080
听着  我不知道斯多克斯怎么跟你说的
Listen,i don't know what Stokes told you,

623
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,041
我真的从未和别人说过
But I didn't tell a soul.

624
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,070
该死  杰克  你想干什么
Damn it,Jack,what the hell are you doing?

625
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:31,007
别这么干
Don't do it.

626
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,048
你这么做会把监视任务升级为一场火拼
You're gonna turn a surveillance job into a firefight.

627
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:35,071
-那会是一个两对十的局面啊  -两对九
- It'll be two against ten. - Two against nine.

628
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:37,064
就算是  我们也失去了
Right,and we lose our best chance

629
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,021
夺到武器的最佳时机
At getting this weapon.

630
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:41,003
别坏了你自己的规矩
Don't break your own rules.

631
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:42,045
你或许救得了一个人
You may save one man,

632
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:43,078
但那些可能因生化武器
But what about the thousands of people

633
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:45,051
而死去的成千上万的人怎么办
Who could die in a biological attack?

634
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:47,087
是你的承诺重要还是他们的命重要
Is this about you,Jack,or about them?

635
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:51,006
你想阻止一场灾难  还是想让它发生
You want to prevent another disaster or ensure that it's going to happen?

636
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:58,033
够远了
That's far enough.

637
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:02,014
转过去
Turn around.

638
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:06,017
你要杀我
You're going to kill me,

639
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,034
就得正视着我的眼睛开枪
You're going to have to look me in the eye.

640
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,092
好吧
Okay.

641
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,068
该死
Damn it.

642
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:19,032
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you,thank you.

643
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,088
在他们发现之前
We've got about 30 seconds

644
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:22,039
我们还有30秒时间
Before they figure out what happened.

645
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:23,072
我们的备用计划呢
Okay,what's our fallback?

646
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:26,047
-偷卡车  -硬来吗
- Steal the truck.  - Strong?

647
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:28,058
我负责正面强攻  你从东侧掩护我
I'll make the direct assault,you cover the east flank.

648
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:30,009
我们只需要狠狠地干上一场
All we need is a big enough firefight

649
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:32,006
好让我们中的一个混上车  准备好了吗
To get one of us behind the wheel. You ready?

650
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:33,078
-是的  -行动
- Yeah. - Go.

651
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:39,093
怎么样了
How do we look?

652
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:44,012
检测完毕  长官
Diagnostics check out,sir.

653
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:45,061
一切正常
The package is stable.

654
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:46,080
好
Good.

655
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,038
把货装上车
All right,let's get her on the chassis!

656
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:11,074
库柏  快点  我们出发了
Cooper,come on. Let's roll.

657
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,064
库柏  收到没
Cooper,do you copy?

658
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,021
多伦
Dolen.

659
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:26,022
检查下隔壁的通道  把库柏找出来
Check the next aisle over. Find cooper.

660
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,082
待在那
Hold your position.

661
00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:34,037
等我信号
Wait for my signal.

662
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:39,096
库柏死了  库柏死了
Cooper's down,cooper's down.

663
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:41,073
警报  警报
Go red,go red!

664
00:33:41,073 --> 00:33:43,019
快走  格里尔
Let's move out... greer.

665
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,070
打  打
Engage... engage.

666
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:41,026
瑞斯  快把车开走
Reese,get the truck out of here now!

667
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:43,043
上  上  上
Go,go,go!

668
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,053
托尼
Tony!

669
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,082
我去追卡车
The truck-- i'm going after it.

670
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:47,094
-掩护我  -好的
- Cover me now! - All right.

671
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:21,017
两个枪手  呈扇形展开  找出他们
Two shooters-- fan out and find them.

672
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:55,022
托尼  我是杰克  能听到吗
Tony,this is Jack-- do you copy?

673
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:11,017
放下武器
Drop it.

674
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:17,055
托尼
Tony?

675
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,067
我认识你
I know you.

676
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:22,013
你是爱默生的人
You're on emerson's crew.

677
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:25,018
-你是阿尔梅达  对吧  -该死
- You're almeida,right?  - Damn it!

678
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:31,077
我知道鲍尔和你在一起  他在哪
I know Bauer's with you. Now,where is he?

679
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:03,011
-我是拉里·莫斯  -拉里  我是杰克
- Larry Moss  - Larry,it's Jack.

680
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:05,019
杰克  你死哪里去了
Jack,where the hell have you been?

681
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,086
你马上紧急调派多职能小队过来
I need you to scramble multiple teams

682
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:09,066
在236高速的29号出口的车辆称重站那
To a weigh station on highway 236,exit 29.

683
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:11,087
我在南边10英里的一辆大拖车上
I'm in a big rig about ten miles south.

684
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:12,071
出什么事了
What's going on?

685
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:14,077
你还得派疾病控制中心的人来
You also need to send a CDC recovery unit.

686
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:15,034
为什么
Why?

687
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:19,016
我这有在亚历山大港截获的生化武器 
I'm in possession of a biological weapon interdicted at the port of alexandria.

688
00:37:19,045 --> 00:37:21,036
生化武器
A biological weapon?

689
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:22,038
拉里  听我说
Larry,just listen to me.

690
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,073
我不在乎你是否要抓我
I don't care if you arrest me.

691
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:24,058
也不在乎你是否要杀我
I don't care if you shoot me.

692
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:26,009
只管把你的人派过来就是了
Just get your teams out here.

693
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:28,089
估计敌人会尾随而来
I fully expect to be pursued by hostiles.

694
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,032
是斯塔克伍德的人吗
Starkwood?

695
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,049
你怎么知道斯塔克伍德的
How do you know about starkwood?

696
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,060
我和蕾妮谈过
I talked to Renee.

697
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,018
我在迈尔的电脑上也看到了
And i saw what was on mayer's computer.

698
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,073
拉里  他们是冲着武器来的
Larry,they're coming after this weapon.

699
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:37,012
绝没有错的
You can count on it.

700
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:39,053
注意  我相信  托尼已成了人质
Now,be advised,i believe that Tony Almeida is being held hostage.

701
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,017
好  我会发出部门预警的
All right,i'll call out an inter-agency alert.

702
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:43,061
我们会从两处双管齐下
We'll secure both locations.

703
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,087
拉里  快点
Larry,hurry.

704
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,025
该死
Damn it!

705
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:04,062
长官  我是斯多克斯
Sir,this is Stokes.

706
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,007
你那边情况如何
What's your status?

707
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:07,094
武器到手了  我们在返回途中
The package is secure-- we're inbound.

708
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:09,076
鲍尔呢
What about bauer?

709
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:11,023
他在现场  长官
He's at the scene,sir,

710
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:12,036
但他躲到了附近的掩体
But he sought cover nearby.

711
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,048
我们得假定他通知了当局
Well,we have to assume that he contacted the authorities,

712
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,059
我们要加快进度了
So we better be on an accelerated timetable.

713
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:20,043
快过来
Get over here.

714
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:23,024
10分钟内   我们随后就到
It will be there in ten minutes. We're right behind.

715
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:28,040
我这边有地面部队迎接你归来
I've got teams on the ground prepping for your arrival.

716
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:34,050
拉里·莫斯
Larry Moss.

717
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:35,067
拉里  这是杰克
Larry,it's jack.

718
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:37,037
我还在236高速上
I'm still on route 236,

719
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:39,027
但我被迫在离车辆秤重站
But i had to stop approximately seven miles

720
00:41:39,034 --> 00:41:40,074
约7英里处停下来了
Before the weigh station.

721
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,068
杰克  有两队人马正向你处赶去
Jack,i got two units moving to you right now.

722
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:45,009
你得重新部署他们
Yeah,well,you're gonna have to redirect them.

723
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:48,001
斯塔克伍德重新夺回了生化武器

They managed to access one of the dock's freight helicopters.

725
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:54,002
他们火力压制住我  把武器空运走了
While they had me pinned down,they airlifted the freight right out of here.

726
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:56,057
他们从我这位置往正西方走了
They were headed due west from my current position.

727
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:59,023
西边  那里有一处他们的大型军用设施
West... they got a large military facility In that area.

728
00:41:59,029 --> 00:42:01,027
好  把他们重新部署到那去
Okay,good-- redirect the teams there.

729
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:02,095
杰克  我不能攻击私人领地
Jack,i can't assault a private compound

730
00:42:02,095 --> 00:42:04,070
除非我有他们持有生化武器的证据
Unless i have proof that a weapon exists.

731
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:06,034
好吧  疾病控制中心的人呢
Okay,where's the CDC?

732
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:07,047
他们在紧急召集一队人马
They're scrambling a team right now.

733
00:42:07,054 --> 00:42:09,020
把他们派到我这来
Send them to me.

734
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,067
这有你要的证据
You'll have all the proof you need.

735
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:11,091
杰克  发生什么事了
Jack,what happened?

736
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:15,058
