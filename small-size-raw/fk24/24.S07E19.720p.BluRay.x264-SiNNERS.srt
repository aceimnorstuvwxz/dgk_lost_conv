叫医护人员来
We need a medic!

4
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,087
生化剂比我们想的要厉害得多
The bioagent is more virulent than we thought.

5
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:22,020
我们所做的
All we're doing here is just

6
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:24,004
-只是掩蔽症状而已  -我明白
- Masking the symptoms. - I understand.

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,016
不过有件事你也许会考虑一下
There's something you may want to consider.

8
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,040
什么事
What's that?

00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:29,092
一种采用干细胞的可能疗法

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,042
我看过你的档案  你有个女儿

12
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,024
我不想把我的女儿牵扯进来

13
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:37,034
爸

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,031
沃克探员告诉我还有希望
Agent Walker told me that there's a chance,

15
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:43,025
一线希望  我可能救得了你

16
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:45,008
而你却不希望我救你

17
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,032
我快死了
I'm dying,

18
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:50,031
即便有能让我幸存的一线生机
And whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening

19
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,094
我也不要冒着风险  让你坐在我身边
It is not worth the pain for me to let you

20
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,089
看我死去  那样太痛苦了
Sit there and watch me die.

21
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:59,046
杰克  霍奇斯持有13枚

22
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:01,020
载有生化武器的巨蟒导弹

23
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,047
他要求我召回战斗机

24
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:04,047
否则就会发射导弹

25
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:06,054
托尼·阿尔梅达还在斯塔克伍德里面

27
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:10,014
放置连环炸药装置
And lay a series of explosive charges,

28
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:11,031
从而摧毁那些导弹
And take the missiles out.

29
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,058
你知道自己在做什么吗
What do you think you're doing?

30
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:15,038
带我去燃料罐那里
You're gonna take me down to the fuel tanks.

31
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,090
乔纳斯  你的导弹已经被我们摧毁了

32
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:34,043
你玩完了  你被捕了
It's over, and you're under arrest.

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,090
你将面对的  是你无法想象的对手
You can't even begin to imagine what you're up against.

34
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,010
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:39,094
你会知道的
You'll find out.

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,044
莫斯探员  我是戴维斯  在6号侧门

37
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:43,047
我抓到了一个斯塔克伍德的人

38
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:45,014
他随身携带一罐生化武器

39
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,051
-确定是生化武器吗  -就在我眼前
- Are you sure? - I'm looking at it right now.

40
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,041
斯塔克伍德的一个雇佣兵

41
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:53,018
他带走了一罐生化武器

42

所以我要你封锁所有出去的道路

43
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,002
让周边小组和首府警察保持警戒

44
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,039
詹尼丝  给我接通首府警局

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,080
托尼  托尼
Tony! Tony!

50
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:20,034
老天
Oh, god. oh...

你多久能到那里

57
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:46,013
有关于霍奇斯被拘捕的更多信息吗

58
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,050
他们没有透露太多
They didn't give me a lot.

59
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:48,090
明显的是  乔纳斯当时正跟总统
Apparently, Jonas was in some kind

60
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:50,027
进行某种政治会面

61
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,087
然后情况失控了

62
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:54,051
接着他要求见他亲爱的律师

66
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:11,020
詹尼斯  我们刚刚识别出了疑犯的身份

67
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:13,030
斯塔克伍德的一台监控摄像机

把这信息传给拉里

73
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,071
他需要知道我们追捕的对象

74
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:23,058
我在用对讲机联系他  但他一直没回应
I've been trying. He's not answering his comm.

75
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,018
增援人员有多远
How far away is backup?

76
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,088
他们还有几分钟  帕克的小组

装生化武器的罐子就在封锁区里

79
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,006
将盖尔维兹的图像及描述

80
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:35,065
分发给战术小组及各部门
To tactical and distribute department wide.

81
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,020
好
Got it.

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,049
继续联系拉里
And keep trying Larry.

83
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:41,003
各小组注意
To all units,

84
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,096
我正将疑犯照片上传至

00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:23,020
阿尔梅达  阿尔梅达  在吗
Almeida? Almeida, are you there?

91
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:25,010
你到安全位置了吗
Are you in a secure location?

92
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:26,051
我躲在杰弗逊大街
I'm holed up in a storage yard

93
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:27,091
建筑工程屋旁的堆场里
near the projects on Jefferson.

94
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:29,027
我刚看到一个巡逻警察
But I just spotted a patrol.

95
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,068
我最好离开这里
I think I better keep moving.

96
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,084
别走
No, don't.

97
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:34,088
调查局刚刚封锁了整个区域
The FBI's got the entire perimeter locked down.

98
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,072
他们知道你是谁
And they know who you are.

99
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:36,051
怎么知道的
How?

100
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:38,012
他们有你的图像
They have a picture.

101
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:41,002
所以搜捕队看见你就能认出来
Which means the search teams can ID you on sight.

102
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,022
待在原地  我看见他们的搜捕协议后
Just stay put until I can get a read

103
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,042
会引导你逃出去的
On their search protocols, and I'll guide you out.

104
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:47,013
我当初真不应该听你的来帮你
I should have never let you talk me into helping you.

105
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,043
我答应你  你帮我偷的那个罐子
I promise you, that canister you stole for me

106
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,053
我效力的那些人会付很多钱的
Is worth a lot of money to the people I'm working for.

107
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,047
我坐牢那些钱还有个屁用
Hell of a lot of good that money's gonna do me in prison.

108
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,033
闭嘴  照我说的做
Just shut up and do what I tell you to do.

109
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,067
守好罐子  原地待命  等我的电话
Guard the canister, stay put, and wait for my call.

110
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,085
有探员受伤
We've got agents down.

111
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:16,035
快派医疗队来
Get a med team out here now.

112
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,046
阿尔梅达
Almeida?

113
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:20,053
阿尔梅达  听得到吗
Almeida, can you hear me?

114
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,090
出什么事了
What happened?

115
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,023
疑犯在哪里
Where's the suspect?

116
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,053
他偷袭了我们
He ambushed us.

117
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,067
你看见他往哪边去了吗
Did you see where he went?

118
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,067
我不知道
I don't know.

119
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:32,000
蕾妮  我刚刚得到确认
Renee, I just got confirmation

120
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,027
战术小组已到达现场
The tac team has arrived at the scene.

121
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:36,021
-有拉里的消息吗  -还没有
- Do we have a 20 on Larry? - Not yet.

122
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,064
打扰一下  沃克探员
Excuse me, agent Walker.

123
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,098
-我知道你很忙  -金
- I know you're busy. - Kim.

124
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:41,098
我是来向你告别的
I just came to say good-bye.

125
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,038
告别  你要去哪里
Good-bye? Where are you going?

126
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:45,008
回洛杉矶
Back to L.A.

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,017
我不明白
Um, I don't understand.

128
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:50,033
你不打算进行实验疗法来救你父亲了吗
You're not going through with the treatment to help your father?

129
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,032
这是他治愈的唯一机会啊
I mean, it's his only chance for a cure.

130
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,083
我知道  他也知道
I know that, and so does he.

131
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,036
但机会渺茫
But it's a slim one,

132
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:57,036
他觉得
And he believes

133
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,016
不值得一试
It's not worth taking, so...

134
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:02,074
如果真的不幸发生  他希望独自承担
If he's going to die, he wants it to be on his terms.

135
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,077
对  但你不能让他回心转意吗
Yes, but can't you change his mind?

136
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:07,050
我觉得你现在应该会了解到
I would think you'd know by now

137
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,050
我爸爸一但下定决心
That no one can change my father's mind

138
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:10,067
没人可以改变
When it's made up.

139
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:13,017

I wish I could have said more,

145
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,078
但是我不想让他更加痛苦了
But i don't want to cause him any more pain.

146
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:26,082

147
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,008
帕克探员找你

他中了嫌疑犯的埋伏
Apparently,he was killed in an ambush by the suspect.

155

No,but the area's been cordoned off.

161
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,072
他跑不了多远

162
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,032
我们在现场设立了一个行动基地
We're setting up an operations base here on the scene

163
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,063

173
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,039

176
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,030
你告知一下白宫
I need you to brief the white house on what's happened.

177
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:49,010
通知梅瑟尔医生在封锁线
Call dr. macer and have her deploy a hazmat team

181
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:59,047
必须有人去告知一下拉里的前妻
Someone's going to need to notify larry's ex-wife.

182
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:03,095
但不该由我去说
Probably shouldn't be me.

183
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,081
没事  我去告诉她好了
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

184
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,022
好
All right.

185
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:18,006
刚才我们回顾了3点到8点

188
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,070
鲍尔先生
Now,Mr. Bauer,

189
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,070
你休息一下吧
Maybe you'd like to take a break.

190
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:27,030
不  应该在我还清醒的时候做完简报
No. we need to finish this while i still can.

191
00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:28,047
继续
Let's go.

192
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:31,031
根据你之前的汇报说
Now,according to your earlier statement,

193
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,004
差不多这个时候
It was about this time you received

194
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:35,021
你收到白宫受到威胁的情报
Intel regarding the imminent attack on the white house.

195
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:37,078
是托尼·阿尔梅达提供给我的
Tony almeida provided me with the intel,

196
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,011
但我们当时并不知道
But we did not know

197
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:40,002
白宫是袭击目标
The white house was a target at that time.

198
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,094
谁是阿尔梅达的消息来源
And who was mr. almeida's source?

199
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:44,054
他是在审讯中从一个雇佣兵口中得知的
He was interrogating a mercenary.

200
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,031
他说名字了吗
Did almeida give you a name?

201
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:48,017
嗯
Um...

202
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:50,024
对不起

203
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:55,008
卡蒂夫  他说是文森特·卡蒂夫
Car... cardiff. he said his name was Vincent Cardiff.

204
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:58,061
你有没有亲自对他问询过
Did you yourself question the source?

205
00:09:58,061 --> 00:09:59,055
没有
No.

206
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:02,019
他没有撑过托尼的拷问
He didn't survive tony's interrogation,

207
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,002
但是他告诉我们关于下一次袭击的情报
But he was the one who provided us with the intel on the upcoming attack.

208
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,038
但我们当时并不知道
But we did not know

209
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,042
白宫是袭击目标
That the white house was the intended target at that time.

210
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,045
我们当时并不知道白宫是袭击目标
We did not know the white house was the intended target...

211
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:12,052
鲍尔先生
Mr. Bauer?

212
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:17,016
你还坚持不要休息吗
You sure you don't want to take that break?

213
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:19,029
我又在不断重复了
Um,I'm repeating myself again.

214
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,030
对不起
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:25,020
这是你要的数据文件
Here's the data file you asked for,sir.

216
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,090
汤姆  快点
Tom,we need to move.

217
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:28,044
沃克探员给我们派了任务
Agent walker's got our assignments.

218
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:32,078
失陪一下
Excuse me.

219
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:40,055
我们一定要控制局势
We're not going to lose control of this situation.

220

我知道你们都加了班  很累了
I know that most of you are tired,working double shifts,

221
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:45,075
但是我要你们全部精神集中且保持警惕
But I need each and every one of you focused and alert

222
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,052
我们要找到嫌犯
If we are going to locate the suspect

223
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,042
和他身上的生化武器罐
And secure the bioweapon canister that he's carrying.

224
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,099
我在执行外勤任务时

225
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:53,066
相关情报都要交给詹尼斯

229
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,077
生化武器还没有找到吗
The bioweapon's still out there?

230
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,091
局势在我们掌控中
We have it contained.

231
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:04,041
等会儿
Wait a second.

247
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,071
就会打到你的脾动脉了

你应该再去医院检查一下

我知道  但现在不行

00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:36,012
他们不得不进去搜查的地方
Where they have to enter and search.

278
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,083
我们要把他们
We need to draw as many of them

279
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,043
尽可能多地引进楼里
Into the building as possible.

280
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,093
然后引爆
Then blow it.

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,060
你要我灭掉那些调查局探员吗
You want me to blow up a couple of dozen FBI agents?

282
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,090
有什么问题吗
You got a problem with that?

283
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,010
他们还是会设置封锁线
They're still gonna have the perimeter locked down.

284
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,034
我可不认为这样做
I don't see how doing this

285
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,090
就能让我带着毒气罐离开
Is gonna get me out of here with the canister.

286
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:50,077
我已经想好对策了
Yeah, I've got that worked out.

287
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:06,049
杰克  你怎么来了
Jack, what the hell are you doing?

288
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:08,019
我和你一起去
I'm going with you.

289
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,042
你病了
You're ill.

290
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,033
如果我妨碍了你的行动
If my condition interferes with your operation,

291
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,036
我会退出
I will stand down.

292
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,033
-我保证  -杰克
- I give you my word. - Jack...

293
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,043
你要把时间都浪费在
You want keep arguing about this,

294
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,046
无意义的争论上吗  那好
Waste more time? fine.

295
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,013
我不会下去的
I'm not getting out.

296
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,000
早上好
Good morning.

297
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:45,013
早上好
Good morning.

298
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,043
埃姆斯女士
Ms. Eames.

299
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,010
你是乔纳斯·霍奇斯的律师
You're Jonas Hodges' attorney.

300
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:50,084
没错
That's right.

301
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,041
上头说你会来
They told us to expect you.

302
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:54,004
请把你的拇指
I just need you to place your thumb

303
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:56,011
放在玻璃上
Against the glass.

304
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,059
好了  卡登探员会送你
Okay. Sergeant Cadden will escort you

305
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:09,066
去等候区
To the holding area.

306
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:12,096
谢谢
Thank you.

307
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,046
这个人怎么会携带一罐生化武器
How could this man have gotten out of Starkwood

308
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:18,000
逃出斯塔克伍德的
With a canister of the bioweapon?

309
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,003
没人知道
No one's sure.

310
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,053
不过他已经杀了4个人
But he's already murdered four people.

311
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
包括拉里·莫斯
Including Larry Moss.

312
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,091
调查局追踪他
The FBI has tracked him

313
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,007
到了附近的一个居民区
To a nearby residential district.

314
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,058
他们封锁了整个区域
They've sealed off the area

315
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,074
正在展开地毯式搜查
And are conducting a thorough search.

316
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,078
妈  这个卡维兹在斯塔克伍德工作
Mom,this man Galvez is a Starkwood operative.

317
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,042
很明显  霍奇斯是幕后主谋
Clearly, Hodges is behind this.

318
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:37,075
或许吧
Maybe.

319
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:39,039
你说或许是什么意思
What do you mean, maybe?

320
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,009
霍奇斯被逮捕时
As hodges was taken away,

321
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,012
他说还没结束
He said it wasn't over.

322
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,043
他提到了还有其他人
He alluded to others,

323
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:50,041
说他自己只是冰山一角
Called himself a small cog in a very large machine

324
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,092
我没有能力去阻止他们
That I wouldn't be able to stop.

325
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:53,024
他在危言耸听
He was ranting.

326
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,013
他不一定是在说谎
That doesn't mean he wasn't telling the truth.

327
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,030
我们要查清楚霍奇斯到底知道些什么
We need to find out what Hodges knows about this.

328
00:14:57,037 --> 00:15:00,041
把他带去调查局审问
I want him taken to the FBI for interrogation.

329
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:02,044
妈  他是反社会者
He's a sociopath, mom.

330
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:04,051
他不会交代的  他一定会
He's not going to talk. He's going to want

331
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:07,035
以合作为条件来跟你谈交易
To make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation.

332
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,019
妈  你不是想
Mom, you're not considering that...

333
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,032
奥利维亚
Olivia...

334
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,029
你了解这个人  知道他对罗杰做了什么
You know what this man is, what he did to roger.

335
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:18,036
把他带去调查局
Just get him to FBI.

336
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:29,084
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges.

337
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,069
你的律师到了
Your attorney's here to see you.

338
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,051
在这个该死的时候
Well, it's about damn time.

339
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:47,042
我们想私下谈谈
We're going to need some privacy.

340
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,086
你比她高一点
You're a little taller than her.

341
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:57,090
但这样也挺漂亮
But it's a good look for you.

342
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:59,090
你好  乔纳斯
Hello, Jonas.

343
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:01,090
我不关心你是怎样进来的
I'm not going to ask how you got in.

344
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:06,017
我感兴趣的是你要如何把我弄出去
But i'm definitely interested in how you're going to get me out.

345
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:11,038
乔纳斯  你现在已是自身难保
Jonas, you're in a very difficult position.

346
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:13,038
你今天的所作所为
And your actions today have put everyone else

347
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,005
也让其他人寸步难行
In a very difficult position.

348
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,088
我明白了
Oh, I see.

349
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,089
我让他们不高兴了  对吧
I've upset the cart, have I?

350
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:22,089
每个人都很生气
Everyone's bent out of shape.

351
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,089
可是  政府冲着我公司发难时
Well, where the hell were they

352
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:26,073
他们又在哪里呢
When the government came after my company?

353
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,040
迈尔参议员和他的那群喽啰
When senator Mayer and his subpoena-waving goon squad

354
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,093
要毁掉我和我的心血时  他们在哪里
Were trying to ruin me and everything I've built?

355
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,097
我们本来可以提供保护的  乔纳斯
You would have been protected, Jonas.

356
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:36,010
保护你和斯塔克伍德
You and Starkwood.

357
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:39,011
但你差点毁了整个计划
But you jeopardized the plan.

358
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:41,074
你为我们研制的生化武器
That bioweapon that you developed for us was

359
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,081
不应用作私人用途
Not intended for personal use.

360
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:46,015
大家一致认为
The consensus

361
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,065
你有某种程度上的
Is that you've had some sort of...

362
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:50,065
精神崩溃
Psychotic break.

363
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:53,065
他们想错了
Well, the consensus is wrong.

364
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,092
现在听你说这句话  我们并不会感到安慰
Coming from you right now, that's not much comfort.

365
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,096
我要跟他们谈谈
I want to talk to them.

366
00:16:58,003 --> 00:17:00,033
帮我联系一下
Get some form of communication between us.

367
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,059
我要跟他们谈谈
I want to talk to them.

368
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:04,020
为时已晚  乔纳斯
I think it's a little late for that, Jonas.

369
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:06,037
你的牌摊的太大了
You've brought undue attention by showing your hand.

370
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:07,067
暴露了你自己
Exposing yourself.

371
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:08,094
我知道你能理解
And I'm sure you could understand

372
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,017
他们觉得你或许会
Their concern that you may,

373
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:12,067
揭发其他人的顾虑
In fact, expose the others as well.

374
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,037
我能做到吗  我连他们是谁都不知道
How can I do that? I don't know who they are.

375
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:17,068
你知道的够多了  他们要确保没人透露
You know enough, and they need to be certain.

376
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,095
我想我们可以达成一致
I think we can agree

377
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,098
你的家人没有必要
That there's no reason for your family

378
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:24,098
为你的错误负责
To pay for your mistakes.

379
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:26,065
这就是你来的原因吗
Is that why you're here?

380
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,099
以我的家人威胁我
To threaten my family.

381
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,052
与此相反
On the contrary.

382
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:32,079
我来是要确保你家人的安全
I came to guarantee your family's safety.

383
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:35,049
如果你照我说的做
If you do the right thing.

384
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,010
这会让你心跳停止
It'll induce cardiac arrest,

385
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,084
而且不会留下痕迹
And leave no trace in your system.

386
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:49,001
自然地  有尊严地死去
A natural, dignified death.

387
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:50,084
到时他们无法对你进行起诉
Without you to prosecute,

388
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,021
这个针对你和你的公司的案子
The case against you and your

389
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:55,015
会很难继续  几乎不可能
Company will be difficult, likely impossible.

390
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:57,048
你这样做至少也是对
Preserving at least some small part

391
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,052
斯塔克伍德爱国传统的一些体现
Of starkwood's legacy of patriotic service.

392
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,039
我知道那对你来说很重要
Which I know is very important to you.

393
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:26,025
时间到了  律师
Party's over, counselor.

394
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:27,078
我们要把他转去调查局
We're moving him to the bureau.

395
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:30,088
我的委托人有权保持沉默
My client has invoked his right to silence and to counsel.

396
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:32,058
没我在场
No one speaks to him

397
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:34,059
谁都不能和他说话  明白吗
Unless in my presence, is that understood?

398
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,052
在一些国家他早就被枪毙了
In some countries they'd have shot him by now.

399
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,062
把他带走
Process him out.

400
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,071
请讲
Yes?

401
00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,095
我见过他了
I met with him.

402
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,011
还有呢
And?

403
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:03,012
我确信他明白我们的意思
I'm quite certain he understands our terms.

404
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,012
他会被送到调查局接受审问
They're transferring him to the FBI for interrogation.

405
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,032
会有问题吗
Will that be a problem?

406
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,085
希望不会  那只会给他压力
Hopefully,it'll just pressure him

407
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,086
让他尽快下定决心
to resolve the situation sooner rather than later.

408
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:12,009
形势对我方有利后我就放宽心了
I'll be happy when this is behind us.

409
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:13,063
有阿尔梅达的消息吗
Have you heard from Almeida?

410
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,063
见到霍奇斯之前我接到了他的电话
He called in before I met with Hodges.

411
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,063
他拿到毒气罐了吗
Has he secured the canister?

412
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,063
很快
Soon.

413
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,030
他是你的人  最好别搞砸了
He's your guy. Better not screw this up.

414
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:25,040
托尼总是能力挽狂澜  转危为安
Tony's been the one bright spot in an otherwise dreary day.

415
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,047
我相信他能做好
I have faith he'll come through.

416
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,041
喂
Yeah?

417
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,015
我找到了一个安置点
I found a place to set up.

418
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:36,098
是一栋废弃的居民楼
It's an abandoned apartment building

419
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,032
距北边封锁线不远
just shy of the north perimeter line.

420
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:42,012
林孔街1297号  12大街的街角
1297 Rincon, corner of 12th.

421
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,052
好  我看到了
Yeah,I see it.

422
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,086
搜捕队刚刚进入
Sweep teams are just entering

423
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:47,053
南部的三个区
three sectors to the south.

424
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,020
你有不到20分钟
You've got less than 20 minutes.

425
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:50,043
时间不够啊
That doesn't give me much time.

426
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,090
是不够  所以你得
No,it doesn't, so maybe you

427
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:54,033
挂了电话赶紧干活儿
should get off the phone and get to it.

428
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,081
我曾连续失去过两个搭档
I lost two partners in a row.

429
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:40,001
早些时候
Early on.

430
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:44,005
我无能为力
I couldn't handle it.

431
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:49,026
我想这就是为什么在过去十年里
I guess that's why over the last ten years,

432
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:51,072
我一直是一个人单打独斗
I've pretty much worked alone.

433
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:58,043
去想这些悲伤的事情也没什么
It's all right for you to be feeling what you feel.

434
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,057
但你今晚不能这样消沉
And if you can't do this tonight,

435
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:02,060
也没什么
that's all right,too.

436
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,094
只是不要试着逞强
Just don't try and pretend

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,061
别装着自己什么感觉都没有
like you're not feeling anything.

438
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,051
要是那样就不对了
That's how you make a mistake.

439
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,034
拜托  杰克  不用教我该用什么感受
Please,Jack,don't tell me what to feel

440
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,028
或者如何调整心情
and don't tell me how to feel it.

441
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,073
沃克探员
Agent Walker.

442
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:46,018
他在那儿
He's over there.

443
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,065
-杰克  -他在哪
-Jack! -Where is he?

444
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:53,032
-他从这边跑了  -你还好吧
-He's running through this way. -You okay?

445
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,039
没事我很走运
Yeah,I got lucky.

446
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:55,089
子弹和要害部位擦肩而过
The bullet went straight through.

447
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,032
没想到在这儿会见到你
Didn't think I'd see you out here.

448
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,039
我来就是看看
I'm only here for observation.

449
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:04,080
你没必要这么做
You do not have to do this.

450
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,047
让我看
Show me.

451
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:44,006
盖上吧
Cover him up.

452
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:47,054
节哀顺变
I'm sorry about Larry.

453
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:49,048
这到底是怎么发生的
How the hell did this happen?

454
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:52,094
一切发生得都太快了  我是说
It all went down pretty fast,I mean...

455
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,071
我们还没下直升机就遭到伏击
We were ambushed before we got out of the helicopter.

456
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:58,082
驾驶员首先中弹
The chopper pilot was hit first.

457
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:01,039
我没带武器  拉里就掩护我
I was unarmed,so Larry laid down cover

458
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,039
我才得以逃生
so I could get clear.

459
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:05,092
我不记得太多  但的确有自动步枪的声音
I don't remember a lot,but I definitely heard auto-fire.

460
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:09,043
我被人追杀  拉里过来
As I was tagged, Larry came over

461
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,070
帮我  结果自己中弹
to help me out and that's when he was hit.

462
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:14,017
之后我就晕倒了
I blacked out after that.

463
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:17,024
但我确定是拉里救了我的命
But I'm pretty sure Larry saved my life.

464
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,034
拉里是被重武器打死的
Larry was hit with heavy ordnance.

465
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,081
身上有霰弹的碎片
Shotgun rounds,armor piercing.

466
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:22,057
你却明显是被小型武器击中的
You were obviously hit with something smaller.

467
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:24,014
我验过阿尔梅达先生的伤
I treated Mr. Almeida.

468
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:26,038
他的伤都是九毫米大
His wound was consistent with a nine millimeter.

469
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:28,038
你确定不是点四五口径
You sure it wasn't a .45?

470
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:30,088
不像  伤口太小  为什么这么问
Not likely-- the entry was too small. Why?

471
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:33,092
因为你们曾把点四五口径武器放在显眼处
Because you have spent .45 casings in evidence.

472
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:38,066
卡维兹能从调查局丢的车里搞到武器
Galvez had access to the weapons inside the FBI vehicle he stole here.

473
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:40,066
他可能会在火拼中换掉武器
He probably switched in the middle of the fight.

474
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:42,019
能换掉那么多
That many weapons?

475
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:44,016
你刚刚说的伏击时间很短啊
In the time frame that you described the ambush?

476
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,056
这可不合情理啊
It doesn't add up.

477
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:47,022
-好吧  那你的意思呢   -他有同党
- Okay,so what are you saying?  - Someone was with him.

478
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,000
我刚说了  一切发生得太快  但是
Like I said,it all happened pretty fast,but...

479
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,077
我是说  我不这么想
I mean,I didn't think so.

480
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:57,034
我觉得有道理
I guess it makes sense.

481
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,061
一个人做不到  他有帮手
One man didn't do this alone. He had help.

482
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:02,075
我去让帕克警戒这个区域
I'll tell Park to alert the field.

483
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,075
你确定你没事
You sure you're okay?

484
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:06,055
是  我很好
Yeah,I'm fine.

485
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:08,019
好
Good.

486
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,087
喂
Hello?

487
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,040
我吵醒你了吗
Did I wake you?

488
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:32,010
今天发这种事谁还睡得着
Who could sleep after what happened today?

489
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:33,090
你爸怎么样
How did it go with your father?

490
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:38,084
亲爱的  怎么了
Sweetheart,what is it?

491
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:40,041
怎么了
What happened?

492
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:43,065
他快死了  史蒂芬
He's dying,Stephen.

493
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,041
什么
What?

494
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:48,085
他被某种病毒感染了
He was exposed to something.

495
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,062
某种生化制剂
Like a biological agent.

496
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,025
和今天早些时候
It had something to do with the attacks

497
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,096
发生的袭击事件有关
that took place earlier today.

498
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:57,099
金  亲爱的  实在抱歉
Kim,honey,I'm so sorry.

499
00:24:58,006 --> 00:25:02,040
还有治愈的希望吗
Um,isn't there anything that they can do?

500
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:05,080
没有
No.

501
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,057
我马上回家
I'm coming back home.

502
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:09,027
你不想留下吗  你不想
Don't you want to stay? Don't you wanna

503
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:12,027
尽可能多地陪他吗
be with him as long as you can?

504
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,028
我待在那儿
My presence,

505
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,085
他现在却受着苦
with what he's going through right now,

506
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:17,061
这只会让事情更糟
will only make things worse.

507
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:22,008
那你有没有告诉他
Did you at least,um,

508
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:24,052
告诉他  他有孙女了吗
Did you tell him about his granddaughter?

509
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:29,009
金
Kim?

510
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:30,036
我不能  史蒂芬
I couldn't,Stephen.

511
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:32,009
我不能告诉他
I couldn't bring myself to tell him

512
00:25:32,016 --> 00:25:35,067
他不仅会扔下我一个
I wasn't the only person he was leaving behind.

513
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:38,094
跟他说泰瑞只会让事情更糟
Telling him about Teri would've only made it worse.

514
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,047
我会试着走610次航班  如果我赶上的话
I'm gonna trying get on the 610. If I do.

515
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,094
我九点就能到洛杉矶
I'll be back in L.A. by 9.

516
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,027
好
Okay.

517
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:48,014
要是改变注意了  就多留在那儿一会儿吧
You can always leave later, if you change your mind.

518
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:51,071
不会的
I won't.

519
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:53,068
我爱你们
I love you both.

520
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:56,032
我们也爱你
We love you,too.

521
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,039
再见
Bye.

522
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:10,097
移动指挥部  我是9号搜捕队
Mobile command,this is sweep 9.

523
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,007
221区域安全
221 is clear.

524
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,064
-继续搜索224区域  -收到
- Proceed to 224. - Copy that.

525
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:18,017
这个区域怎么没有被搜索
Why has that area of the grid not been cleared?

526
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:20,014
3号搜捕小队  你们怎么没搜219区
Sweep 3,why have you not cleared 219?

527
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:21,078
移动指挥部  我们遇到一些
Mobile command,we're encountering some resistance

528
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:23,021
社区内居民的阻挠
from neighborhood residents.

529
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:24,098
他们很不高兴  觉得不应该在凌晨两点半
They're not happy about their homes being searched

530
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:26,092
没有事先通知就搜查他们的房子
wIthout warning at 2:30 in the morning.

531
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:28,082
我在乎的是他们的安全  不是他们的心情
I'm concerned about their safety,not their happiness.

532
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:31,005
协助卡维兹的人可能会给他提供藏身之处
Whoever is helping Galvez may be providing him shelter

533
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:33,016
可能就是其中某间房屋  要是那些人
in one of those houses. If those civilians are

534
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:35,003
继续阻碍搜捕  先逮捕他们  再继续任务
interfering in that sweep, arrest them,but get that

535
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,039
明白吗
area cleared. Do you understand?

536
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:38,039
收到
Copy.

537
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:39,070
杰克
Jack?

538
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:41,003
失陪一下
Excuse me...

539
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:19,057
这是抗痉挛的药物
It's an antiseizure medicine.

540
00:27:19,064 --> 00:27:22,017
我早就该用的
I should've used it earlier.

541
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:23,094
杰克  你在这干什么
Jack,what are you doing out here?

542
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:27,031
你为什么不呆在局里接受治疗
Why don't you go back to fbi medical and let them treat you?

543
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:29,091
没办法治
There is no treatment.

544
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:31,028
无药可医
There's no cure.

545
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,042
等下
Wait.

546
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,082
对不起
I'm sorry.

547
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,022
我不知道
I didn't know.

548
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:42,009
你为什么来现场
Why are you in the field?

549
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:44,059
沃克探员的搭档刚刚牺牲了  托尼
Agent walker just lost her partner,Tony.

550
00:27:47,036 --> 00:27:51,023
我觉得我能帮上忙  我欠她的
I thought I could help. I owe her that much.

551
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,080
斯托勒探员呼叫指挥中心  黄色代码
Agent stoller to mobile command. code yellow.

552
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:55,047
指挥中心  斯托勒探员请讲
Go ahead,agent Stoller, this is mobile command.

553
00:27:55,054 --> 00:27:57,001
你是说黄色代码吗
Are you reporting a code yellow?

554
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,011
是的

716
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:28,057
医生
We need a medic!

717
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:35,087
让他们来照料他  你快跟我出去
They've got him. I want to get you out of here.

718
00:37:35,094 --> 00:37:38,034
快点  我们走
Come on,let's go now.

719
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
你怎么知道这是个陷阱的
How'd you know it was a trap?

720
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
斯托勒的发射器在建筑物外面
Stoller's transponder was outside of the building.

721
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,003
他们想削弱我们封锁线  找突破口
They were trying to thin our ranks,create a diversion.

722
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,080
封锁出现漏洞了没
Has the cordon been breached?

723
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:53,052
没  我告诉他们原地待命
No,I told the men to maintain their positions.

724
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:54,062
封锁线安全
The perimeter's secure.

725
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:55,085
杰克  他们好像知道我们的计划
It's almost like they knew,Jack.

726
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:56,086
他们在楼内布置炸药
They would have needed time

727
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:58,009
总要花时间的
To wire this building with explosives.

728
00:37:58,016 --> 00:38:00,006
这是我们计划搜索的最后一个据点
This was the last sector we were due to search.

729
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:03,029
-你认为他们知道我们的搜索顺序吗  -肯定的
- You think they knew your sweep patterns? - They must have.

730
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,026
上帝啊
Oh,my god.

731
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,040
杰克  怎么了
Jack,what is it?

732
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:09,090
回头在你车那边见
I'll meet you back at your vehicle.

733
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:13,017
要我帮你忙吗
Hey,you want me to take him?

734
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,024
不用  我可以的
No,I got him.

735
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:16,061
里面需要你的帮助
They need your help inside.

736
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,025
米泽尔探员
Agent Mizelli.

737
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:25,058
我是鲍尔  你刚才说到
This is Bauer. you said you wanted to talk to me

738
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:27,065
托尼供的嫌犯文森特·卡蒂夫
About tony's suspect vincent cardiff.

739
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,039
对  你终于回话给我了
Yes,yes,thanks for getting back to me.

740
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:31,022
听着  你告诉我说他
Listen,uh,you told me that he expired

741
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:33,023
在托尼·阿尔梅达的审讯中死了
During the course of tony Almeida's interrogation.

742
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:35,009
对  托尼就是这么跟我说的
Yeah,that's what tony told me.

743
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:36,029
不可能是他
Well,it can't be him.

744
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:37,040
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

745
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:38,043
一小时前文森特·卡蒂夫
Vincent cardiff was picked up

746
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,077
试图偷渡去加拿大
Over an hour ago by customs,

747
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,020
的时候被海关逮捕
Trying to cross the border into Canada.

748
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,077
确定吗
Are you sure?

749
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:44,064
很肯定  我现在拿着他的逮捕报告
Look,I'm positive,I've got his arrest report right here.

750
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,030
卡蒂夫还活着
Cardiff's alive.

751
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:47,031
他身上有没有
Were there any signs

752
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:48,054
被审讯的迹象
From his interrogation

753
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:50,021
暴力威胁  虐待  有吗
Physical violence, abuse,anything at all?

754
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,048
报告上面没写
Nothing's indicated on the report.

755
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:53,011
所以我问你是否
That's why I was asking if maybe

756
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:54,091
有可能把托尼告诉你的名字说错了
You had mistaken the name almeida gave you.

757
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:06,002
接着
Here you go.

758
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:07,059
谢谢
Thanks.

759
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:11,029
托尼
Tony!

760
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,087
托尼
Tony!

761
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:19,017
什么
Yeah.

762
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:23,011
我需要和你谈谈
We need to talk.

763
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:28,088
怎么回事
What's going on?

764
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:33,039
我今天早些时候告诉过你
I told you earlier today,

765
00:39:33,045 --> 00:39:35,045
如果你对我撒谎  我会亲自把你杀了
If you were lying to me I'd kill you myself.

766
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:37,049
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

767
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,012
卡蒂夫  文森特·卡蒂夫
Cardiff,vincent cardiff--

768
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:40,076
你说他在审讯期间死了
You said he was killed during his interrogation.

769
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,079
是啊  怎么了
Yeah,so?

770
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:44,020
他好端端的活着  被逮捕了
He's alive and well,in custody,

771
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:46,026
根本没有曾被虐待的迹象
And he's showing no signs of physical abuse.

772
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,040
解释下
Explain that.

773
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:51,054
好吧  听着  杰克  抱歉
All right,look, Jack,I'm sorry.

774
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,034
卡蒂夫知道一但他泄露了情报
Cardiff knew that by spilling that intel,

775
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,097
肯定会活不成
He was going to get himself killed,

776
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:58,000
我说我可以让调查局认为
I told him i'd let the FBI think

777
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:01,028
他已经死了  让他可以逃匿
He was dead,so he could walk away and disappear.

778
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,092
我认为那是无关紧要的谎话
I thought it was just a meaningless lie.

779
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:05,018
你和我干这行那么多年早应该知道
You and I have been doing this long enough to know

780
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:07,042
根本就没有谎话是无关紧要的
That there is no such thing as a meaningless lie.

781
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:08,059
你在其中扮演什么角色
How are you involved in this?

782
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:09,082
杰克  你这样说没有道理
You're not making any sense,Jack.

783
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:11,022
那情报是对的
That intel was good.

784
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:12,076
没那情报你进不了白宫
Without it you'd have never been in the white house

785
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,076
救不了总统
To save the president.

786
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,009
你到底扮演什么角色
What is your involvement?!

787
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,020
你头脑不清醒了
You're not thinking straight.

788
00:40:18,026 --> 00:40:20,027
你是怎么中枪的
How were you shot?

789
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:22,087
是卡维斯真的还有同伙
Does galvez even have a second man...

790
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:24,024
还是那个同伙就是你
Or was it just you?

791
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,087
住嘴  听下你刚才说的
Just stop and listen to what you're saying.

792
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:27,084
这是扯淡  精神错乱
It's insane. It's paranoia.

793
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,068
快把枪放下吧
Now,why don't you put the gun down?

794
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:32,024
别动
Don't you move!

795
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:34,068
毒素在影响你的判断能力
The toxin is starting to affect your judgment.

796
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:37,028
你知道的  不是吗
That's what's happening. you can see that,right?

797
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,064
这就是你要找的东西对吧
Is this what you're looking for?

798
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:02,054
我不想伤害你  杰克
I never wanted to hurt you,Jack.

799
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:05,078
我告诉过你别管这事
I told you to stay out of it.

800
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:07,061
但你就是不听  是吧
But you wouldn't listen, would you?

801
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:12,025
我需要帮助  他开始抽搐了
Can we get some help here? this man's having a seizure.

802
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:15,000
请后退
Stand back,please.

803
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,029
去拿下我的包  给梅塞尔医生打电话
Go get my bag and call Dr. Mason.

804
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:58,046
我没看到伤口
I don't see anything.

805
00:41:58,053 --> 00:41:59,050
伤口肯定在背部
The wound must be posterior.

806
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:02,047
长官  我需要你翻个身
Sir,I need to turn you on your side.

807
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:15,035
放下对讲机  开你的车
Put it down and keep driving. now!
