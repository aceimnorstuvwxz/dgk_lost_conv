3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,082
是国安局的鲍勃·科内尔打来的电话
That was bob cornell at nsa.

4
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,086
他们检测到另一个防火墙漏洞
They've detected another firewall breach.

5
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,019
是另一次攻击吗
There's been another attack?

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,096
还没确认  但CIP装置已被启用
Not yet, but they believe the cip device is being utilized.

7
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:28,066
我们必须假定杜巴库在酝酿另一次攻击
We have to assume dubaku is initiating another attack.

8
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:31,000
-总统阁下  -什么事  蒂姆
- Madam president. - What is it, tim?

9
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,078
我刚接到一个加密电话
I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,070
是杜巴库上校打来的
It's from colonel dubaku.

11
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:36,053
他要和你通话
He's demanding to speak with you.

12
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:37,077
我给你军队撤离的
The deadline for your forces

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,047
最后期限已经过了
To begin their withdrawal has passed.

14
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:40,070
到窗口去
Go to the window.

15
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:41,094
看你都做了什么
See what you have done.

16
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:45,047
要么在一小时内照我说的做
Comply with my demands within the hour,

17
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:48,002
否则1万多美国人会因此丧命
Or 10,000 more americans will die.

18
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:52,055
她正上楼
She's on her way up.

19
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:54,015
事后我给你打电话
I'll call you when it's done.

20
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,093
泰勒先生  你没事吧
Mr. taylor, are you okay?

21
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:10,023
声音鉴证组分析了录音
Audio forensics cleaned up the recording.

22
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:12,043
沃克无足轻重
Walker is extraneous.

23
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:15,027
到这之前杀了她
Kill her before you get here.

24
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,070
拉里  这么做不值得
Larry, I don't think it's worth it.

25
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:17,074
已没有什么线索了
There's nothing here.

26
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:18,091
好吧
All right. fine,

27
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:20,017
去帮詹尼斯和国安局吧
Help janis coordinate with nsa.

28
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:21,082
她是个优秀的探员
She was a good agent.

29
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:24,098
她还生死未卜呢
We don't know that she's dead yet!

30
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,081
我把我的一切都贡献给了调查局
I've devoted my life to the bureau

31
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:28,025
而你却要我相信
And you just expect me to believe

32
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:30,002
整个政府都腐朽不堪
That the entire government's been corrupted.

33
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:31,039
也不全是
Not all of them.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,092
在找到主谋前  我们不能相信任何人
But until we find out who, we can't trust anyone.

35
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,086
凭你们四个就能阻止这一切吗
And the four of you really think you can stop this?

36
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,086
我们必须这么做
We have to.

37
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,099
就这么简单
It's as simple as that.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,023
杜巴库想要你们夫妻俩
Dubaku wants you and your wife.

39
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:42,026
这就是交易条件
That's the deal.

40
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:44,036
你要冒险把我们
You're asking us to risk our lives

41
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,030
交给杜巴库吗
To be delivered into dubaku's hands.

42
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,094
听他说完  乌勒
Listen to him, ule.

43
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:49,090
我们怎么能相信这个人
But how can we trust this man?

44
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:50,094
因为
Because

45
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:53,011
他没有理由撒谎
He has no reason to lie.

46
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,031
最近怎么样  托尼
How are you doing, tony?

47
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:55,034
还不错
All right.

48
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:56,061
爱默生在哪里
Where's emerson?

49
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:57,061
死了
He's dead.

50
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,009
你还想不想要马托波
You want matobo or not?

51
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:08,016
你得到了你想要的
You got what you came for.

52
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:11,006
现在给我滚
Now, get the hell out of here.

53
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,053
一切进展顺利吗
Did everything go smoothly?

54
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:14,053
马托波夫妇在我们手中  这才是关键
We have the matobos, that's what matters.

55
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:16,086
我在广播中听到了飞机的事
I heard about the planes on the radio.

56
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:19,073
白宫方面还没有屈服
The white house still has not complied.

57
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:20,070
你想怎么做
What do you intend to do?

58
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:22,067
给他们点颜色看看
Exactly what we promised.

59
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:23,070
一切就绪  长官
We're ready, sir.

60
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:25,004
目标定位在哪
Where's the target located?

61
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,071
俄亥俄州的汲沦谷镇
Kidron, ohio.

62
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:28,074
-人口有多少  -3万人
- Population? - 30,000.

63
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,001
伤亡人数将会很高
Casualties will be high.

64
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:32,072
开始
Begin.

65
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:37,007
以下事件发生在下午两点到三点之间

66
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:44,073
拉里
Larry.

67
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:48,014
这应该是绑架马托波用的卡车
We think this is the truck the matobos were abducted in.

68
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,013
哪里拍摄的图像
Where was this image taken?

69
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:51,013
北林机场附近
Near northwoods airfield.

70
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,027
可以追踪到吗
Were you able to track it?

71
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,050
超出这个区域就不行了
Not beyond this sector.

72
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:55,027
不过他们正沿麦金利大街往东开
But they were heading east on mckinley avenue.

73
00:02:55,028 --> 00:02:56,050
很好  把汽车信息分发给
All right. make sure the vehicle i.d.

74
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,034
所有搜索小组

75
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:59,077
-和当地特工机构  -遵命  长官
- And local agencies. - Yes, sir.

76
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:02,061
-拉里  我有线索了  -说吧
- Larry, I think I found something. - Yeah?

77
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:05,028
我和国安局合作  进行逆向追踪
I've been working nsa, trying to back-trace the cip attack

78
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:06,055
找到了攻击飞机的
That took down the two planes.

79
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,038
CIP模块的编码碎片
And I found a code fragment

80
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,022
可能是CIP入侵留下的残余信息
Which I think could be residue from the cip intrusion.

81
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,069
我正进行模式匹配
I'm running a pattern match right now.

82
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,002
运气好的话
With any luck at all,

83
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:16,019
我们或许可以预测到
We may be able to anticipate where in the infrastructure

84
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,029
下一个攻击目标
They're targeting next.

85
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,046
我需要西恩帮忙
And I need sean.

86
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,006
詹尼斯  我不想浪费人手
Janis, I don't want to waste personnel

87
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,043
做徒劳的工作
On some wild-goose chase.

88
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,020
杜巴库威胁要在30分钟内
Dubaku's threatened to kill 10,000 more americans

89
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,043
杀死一万多美国人
In the next 30 minutes.

90
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,063
我明白
I understand that,

91
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:27,040
要是行不通的话我会立刻放弃
And I will drop it the minute it feels cold.

92
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,050
好吧  我要向白宫作简报  随时向我汇报
All right, I'm going to brief the white house. keep me in the loop.

93
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,091
西恩
Sean.

94
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,081
你觉得他有能力解决这次危机吗
Are you sure he's up to running this operation?

95
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:40,081
-拉里没问题的  -真的吗
- Larry's fine. - Is he?

96
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:43,015
是你告诉我他和蕾妮的事
You're the one who told me about him and renee.

97
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,015
这事对他打击很大
This has got to be hitting him pretty hard.

98
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,082
如果我觉得拉里无法胜任工作
If I don't think larry can do his job,

99
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,022
我会告诉你  好吗
I'll let you know, all right?

100
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:52,060
同时  我要你再打开一个新端口
In the meantime, I need you to open up a fresh socket.

101
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:12,071
您已接通布莱恩·盖奇探员的电话
You've reached agent brian gedge.

102
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:14,075
请留言  我会回电

107
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,053
给我回电  盖奇探员

109
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,026
请讲

110
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:31,093
联邦调查局的拉里·莫斯找您
Larry moss with the fbi.

111
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:33,020
什么情况  拉里
Where are we, larry?

112
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:34,053
我们找到了那辆
We've i.d.'d a vehicle

113
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:36,037
绑架马托波的货车
That we believe was used in the matobos' abduction.

114
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:37,084
目前还在追踪中
We're still trying to track it down.

115
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:39,064
还要多久
And how long is that going to take?

116
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:41,071
我很想回答您  长官  但我也不知道何时
I wish I could tell you, sir. I don't have a time frame.

117
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,071
这样不行  拉里
That's not good enough, larry.

118
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:46,048
除非你有所发现  我们才能进攻
Unless you get some results, we're going to get hit again.

119
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,012
找不到杜巴库
A lot of people are going to die

120
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:49,045
就会死很多人
If you don't find dubaku.

121
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:50,078
我明白  长官
With all respect, sir,

122
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,045
无需您提醒
I don't need to be told what's at stake.

123
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:54,015
我们正在全力以赴
We're giving everything we can.

124
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,086
我们中的一个探员已经牺牲了
One of our agents has given her life.

125
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,053
是的  我已经知道了

126

我很遗憾
I'm... I'm sorry.

127
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:02,046
一有情况就马上通知您

128
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,087
保持联系
We'll be waiting.

129
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,045
天呐

130
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:16,054
马托波夫妇被带进一栋建筑

The boyd chemical plant near kidron, ohio.

140

CIP装置已经帮我们
The cip device has enabled us

141
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:04,073
控制了主储气罐
To take control of the main tank.

142
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,040
我们让主安全阀门失灵
We're about to cause the primary safety valves to fail.

143
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:17,061
还记得我们上次的会面吗  乌勒
Do you remember the last time we saw each other, ule?

144
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:21,078
是在你家的晚宴上
It was at a state dinner in your residence.

145
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,095
我们开了瓶好酒
We shared an excellent bottle of wine.

146
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:26,061
我向你伸出友谊之手
I offered my hand in friendship

147
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:30,045
你却拒我于千里之外
And you... slapped it away.

148
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,039
你只想让我成为傀儡
You gave me an ultimatum--

149
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,042
为你的军队服务
To be the puppet for your military.

150
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:36,042
作为一个总理
You could have had a long and prosperous career

151
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,016
你本应该前途无量
As prime minister.

152
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,066
但现在你却将作为叛国贼
But now you're going back to sangala

153
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,093
而返回桑加拉
As a traitor to your people.

154
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:42,076
我是总理
I am prime minister.

155
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,060
是人民选举出来的
I was elected by the people.

156
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,088
你和朱玛才是叛国贼
It's you and juma who are the traitors.

157
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:54,031
不
No.

158
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:56,044
我们给桑加拉带来希望
We brought order to sangala,

159
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:58,061
但你却要破坏
But you are trying to destroy

160
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:00,062
我们所做的一切
Everything that we've built.

161
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:06,049
你将会被带回桑加拉  乌勒
You'll be taken back to sangala, ule,

162
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,086
你要向朱玛将军
And you will give general juma

163
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:11,016
交代出你的叛国贼同党
The names of all your fellow traitors.

164
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:13,019
我绝不会那样做
I will never do that.

165
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,040
绝不
Never.

166
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:26,055
相信我  你会的
Believe me, you will.

167
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,069
带走
Take them.

168
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:38,052
总统有什么反应吗
Any response from the president?

169
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:40,025
还没
Not yet.

170
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,019
当她看到有美国人横尸街头时
But once she sees dead americans

171
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,080
她就不会那么顽固了
Lying in the street, she will be less stubborn.

172
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:00,041
我进去了  杰克  正走向前台

00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,054
如果有人问起
So as far as you're concerned,

186
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:34,067
我从来没来过  明白吗
I was never here, understand?

187
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,099

国土安全局有个高价值目标数据库

防火墙漏洞

布拉诺先生  我们有理由相信
Mr. brunner, I have reason

276
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,025
这是一次针对你工厂的
To believe that this is a terrorist attack

277

恐怖袭击

00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,062
现场紧急应急程序
On-site emergency procedures

281
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,023
并保持通话
And stay on this line.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,009
关闭那个储气罐
Shut down the tank.

283
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,062
-出什么事了  -快点  快点
What's going on? do it! do it!

284
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:51,007
我命令你
My authority.

285
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,006
-该死  -怎么了
- Damn. - what is it?

286
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:57,051
-没反应  -什么意思  再试试
- It's not responding. - what do you mean? try it again.

287
00:13:58,084 --> 00:14:00,048
还是没有
Nothing.

288
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:06,028
主储气罐的压力正在升高
Pressure in the primary tank is rising.

289
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:10,021
-该死的  -布拉诺先生
- Son of a bitch. - mr. brunner?

290
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,038
我们无法关闭主储气罐
We cannot shut down the primary tank

291
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,018
它的压力在升高
And the pressure is building.

292
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,025
如果阻止不了的话
If we cannot stop this, we are looking

293
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:18,045
毒气就会释放到大气中
At atmospheric release.

294
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:20,045
好的
Okay.

295
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,062
去叫拉里
Get larry.

296
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:23,049
杜巴库已经袭击了那个工厂
Dubaku has targeted that facility.

297
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,040
我们得通知总统
We need to alert the president.

298
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:27,019
布拉诺先生
Mr. brunner,

299
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,010
你现在必须开始疏散人群了
you need to begin evacuating people right now

300
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,049
好的  莫斯探员  有事马上通知我
All right, agent moss, keep me apprised.

301
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,063
我马上向总统汇报
I'll speak to the president.

302
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:51,006
我刚收到一个内部警报
I just received an inter agency alert.

303
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,043
联调局刚发现了杜巴库的下一个目标
The fbi just discovered dubaku's next target.

304
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:54,057
一个化工厂  是的
A chemical plant, yeah.

305
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,047
我刚跟拉里·莫斯通过电话
I just got off the phone with larry moss.

306
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:57,080
我得向总统做简报
I need to brief the president.

307
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:00,004
第一先生跟总统谈过了么
Has the first gentleman spoken with the president?

308
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,071
还没
Not yet.

309
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:04,011
四十分钟前  我跟盖奇特工说过了
I talked to agent gedge 40 minutes ago.

310
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:06,045
泰勒先生是唯一能劝说总统
Mr. taylor is the only person who can talk the president

311
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:08,011
从桑加拉撤兵的人
Into withdrawing our troops in sangala.

312
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:10,005
这也是阻止袭击的最佳方案
And that is our best way to prevent this attack.

313
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:11,028
我知道我们需要他
I know we need him.

314
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,075
我等他给我回电话呢
I'm waiting for a call back.

315
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:15,046
我还是不满意中间的部分  再念一遍
The middle section's still bothering me; read it again.

316
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,092
杜巴库上校和朱玛集团
"colonel dubaku and the juma regime have killed

317
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:19,086
已经杀害了无数同胞
"countless thousands of their own people,

318
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:21,073
和数以百计的美国人民
"and now hundreds of our fellow citizens.

319
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:24,073
让亡者安息  让刽子手接受愤怒的惩罚
They deserve your prayers and your outrage."

320
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:26,050
我觉得"愤怒"用得有点过了
I think the word "outrage" might be too strong

321
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,010
如果您想让民众
If you're trying to convey

322
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,024
平静下来的话
Calm authority.

323
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:30,074
愤怒  是唯一一个能表达
"outrage" is the only word

324
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:32,064
我现在感情的词  它也能代表
To describe how I'm feeling, and how every person

325
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,097
每个美国民众的心情
In this country will be feeling.

326
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,074
美国的人民应该知道真相
The american people deserve the truth.

327
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:38,068
杜巴库已经杀死了三百个美国人
Dubaku's already killed 300 americans.

328
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:41,036
天知道他在策划着什么阴谋
God knows what else he has planned.

329
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,076
进来
Come in.

330
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:48,083
给我们点时间  安吉拉
Could you excuse us, angela?

331
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:56,070
什么事
What is it?

332
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:58,063
联邦调查局发现了
The fbi believes they've detected

333
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,018
下一个袭击目标
Where the next attack will take place.

334
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,064
杜巴库想要使俄亥俄州汲沦谷
Dubaku's infiltrated a chemical plant

335
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,021
一家化工厂发生泄露
Just outside of kidron, ohio.

336
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:08,038
他已经使工厂里的主储气罐的
He's causing the pressure on the facility's

337
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,088
压力达到了临界值
Primary tank to go critical.

338
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,048
如果储气罐破裂  三千多加仑甲基异氰酸脂
If the tank erupts, over 3,000 gallons

339
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:14,055
就会被释放到空气中
Of methyl isocyanate will be released into the atmosphere.

340
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,062
在风的作用下
Given the prevailing winds,

341
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:19,005
一片大面积的毒云
A very large, very toxic cloud

342
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:20,039
将横扫城镇
Will sweep into town.

343
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,012
甲基异氰酸脂
Methyl isocyanate

344
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,076
是一种高浓缩杀虫剂
Is a concentrated insecticide.

345
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:26,016
即使少量接触  也会造成严重的肺损伤
Even brief exposure causes severe lung damage

346
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:28,016
和对皮肤的化学烧伤
And chemical burns of the skin.

347
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,070
我们还有多少时间
What's our time frame?

348
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,046
十五分钟内  储气罐就可能破裂
The tank could rupture in less than 15 minutes.

349
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,020
他们已经开始疏散了么
They've begun evacuating?

350
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:35,004
我们已经在汲沦谷当地
We've already contacted emergency responders

351
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,034
派出了紧急事件反应部队
On the ground in kidron.

352
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:37,097
但是时间不够 把所有人都救出来
It's just not enough time to get everyone out.

353
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:42,052
汲沦谷的人口超过三万
Kidron's population's just over 30,000.

354
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,091
预计我们将损失
This projection says that

355
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:47,019
超过五成的人
We could lose over 50%?

356
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,015
天哪
Oh, dear lord...

357
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:55,009
现在  唯一阻止这事的办法

358
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,027
就是找到杜巴库和CIP装置

轻轻地

把探测器给我从包里拿出来
Give me the scope out of the bag.

368
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,068
调到夜视状态

我没看到杜巴库

385
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,028
现在不行

386
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,051
工厂情况怎么样

电脑系统已经失控了
We're not in control of the computer system.

392
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:38,066
我已经叫我的人撤离了
I've already told my people to get the hell out of here.

393
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,026
通常我不允许别人叫我宝贝
Normally, I don't allow people

394

不过这事可以以后再说

395
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,023
听起来你需要放松一下

是不顶用  不过应该能
No, but it might buy us

402
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,071
给大家的撤离创造一些时间
A few more minutes so people can evacuate.

403
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:01,001
这工厂里有一千多员工呢

408
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,073
我的权限不够修改控制图
I don't have access to the override schematics.

409
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:15,003
看你能不能调出

Maybe there was a malfunction in the cip device.

561
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:02,032
不  我不要猜测  我只想知道事实
No, no, I don't want maybes, all right? I want answers.

562
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:03,079
我们正在全力以赴  先生
We're doing everything we can, sir.

563
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,009
这还不够  不对吗
That's not good enough right now, is it?!

564
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,059
我不知道该说什么了  先生
I don't know what else to tell you, sir.

565
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,086
我知道您对蕾妮的事很不安
I know you're upset about renee,

566
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:13,063
但是对我发脾气也是无济于事
But getting angry at me is not going to make it go any faster.

567
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:15,090
如果你认为我是因为沃克探员的事
If you think I'm yelling at you because of my history

568
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,087
而对你大喊大叫  那你就错了
With agent walker, you are mistaken.

569
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:19,067
成千上万的民众正处于危险之中
There are thousands of lives at stake here.

570
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:21,037
这才是让我不安的原因
That's what concerns me.

571
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,044
抱歉  先生
Sorry, sir.

572
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:27,098
我要你和詹尼斯同国安局合作
I want you and janis to work with nsa.

573
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:30,085
找到CIP装置的具体位置
Find out where that cip device is being used.

574
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:34,002
只要我们找到装置  就能找到杜巴库
If we find the device, we find dubaku.

575
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:49,057
谢谢您的来电
I appreciate the call. thanks a lot.

576
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:51,054
詹尼斯  拉里让你和国安局合作
Janis, larry wants you to interface with nsa.

577
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:54,077
看能否反追踪到CIP装置的具体位置
See if you can back-trace that cip code fragment to its source.

578
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:56,038
我试试
I'll try.

579
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:58,041
你在和谁通话
Who were you talking to?

580
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,088
工厂快速反应小组的负责人
The head of the response team at the plant.

581
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:02,031
他怎么说
What did he say?

582
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,075
设备已经安全了
Facility's clean.

583
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,099
少量的化学气体发生了泄露
A trace amount of the chemical was released, but not enough

584
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:07,085
但不足以造成伤害  现场已经被保护起来了
To do any damage, and the site has been secured.

585
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,002
很好
That's good.

586
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,039
那个工厂经理怎么样了
What about the plant manager?

587
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,066
约翰·布拉诺
John brunner.

588
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,016
他没事吧
Is he okay?

589
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:14,076
不
No.

590
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:16,033
能帮个忙吗
Will you do me a favor?

591
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,066
说说看
It depends.

592
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:19,050
我想通知布拉诺先生的家人
I'd like to track down mr. brunner's family.

593
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,083
我是最后一个和他通话的人
I was the last one to speak with him,

594
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,037
我认为应该让他们知道他是多么勇敢
And I feel they should know how brave he was.

595
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,067
我找找看
I'll see what I can find.

596
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:26,011
谢谢
Thank you.

597
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:28,087
詹尼斯  在节哀之前
Janis, before you start sending flowers,

598
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:31,018
你应该先找出CIP装置的具体位置
You need to find out where that cip device was being used.

599
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:34,008
知道了  我正在找
I know. I'm on it.

600
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,029
清理小组已经到达现场
Cleanup crews are already on site

601
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,036
我们正在进行工厂周围
And we're continuing our evacuation of a one-mile radius

602
00:29:57,037 --> 00:29:58,073
1英里的疏散撤离工作
Around the chemical plant.

603
00:29:58,074 --> 00:29:59,099
伤亡情况呢
Casualties?

604
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,050
实际死亡  只有一人 是工厂的经理
There was, in fact, one casualty, The plant manager.

605
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,026
剩余因化学品烧伤和吸入有毒气体
13 other workers are being treated

606
00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:06,070
而受伤的13名工人已被送去急救
For chemical burns and inhalation of toxic fumes.

607
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,040
再就没有任何针对防火墙的入侵行动吗
And there haven't been any other intrusions in the firewall?

608
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,017
没有了  女士
No, ma'am.

609
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,091
看起来好像危机已经解除了
It appears the crisis has been averted.

610
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:14,044
除此以外  没人能解释
Except that no one's been able

611
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,018
防火墙为什么又安全了
To explain how the firewall break disengaged.

612
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,055
目前是的
Not yet.

613
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:20,025
联邦调查局也毫无头绪
The fbi has no idea how it happened... it just happened.

614
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,012
这讲不通
And that's not an explanation.

615
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:24,095
可能杜巴库正要发布另一个警告
Perhaps dubaku was firing another warning shot.

616
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:27,022
不可能  杜巴库已经弄下了两架飞机
No, dubaku's already down two planes.

617
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:28,099
他不会在乎死更多的人
He's not afraid to take more lives.

618
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,009
不管怎么说  我们现在安全了
In any event, we should be grateful.

619
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,056
除非知道真相  否则我是不会
I'm not one to accept good news

620
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:36,067
接受这样的好消息的
Unless I know where it comes from.

621
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:41,004
找出真相前  我要维持目前的安全等级
Until we have more answers, I want to maintain alert levels.

622
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,094
什么事
Yes?

623
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:45,041
总统阁下  史密斯上将在2号线
Madam president, I have admiral Smith on line two.

624
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:48,081
接进来  谢谢你  蒂姆
Put him through. thank you, tim.

625
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:50,054
上将
Admiral?

626
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:55,002
我一直在打盖奇探员的电话  但始终没人接
I've been trying to reach agent gedge, and he hasn't picked up.

627
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,049
是的  我确定号码没错
Yes, I'm sure I have the right number.

628
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,072
一小时前我刚跟他通过话
I just spoke to him over an hour ago.

629
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:02,049
他说他在萨曼莎·罗斯的公寓外面
He said he was outside samantha roth's apartment

630
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,099
在等第一先生
Waiting for the first gentleman.

631
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,033
找到他
Just find him.

632
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:11,037
我不管你派谁去
I don't care who you have to pull off shift.

633
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,080
还是联系不上盖奇
Still can't reach gedge.

634
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:15,068
特勤处也找不到他
The secret service doesn't know where he is either.

635
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:19,087
我需要告诉总统
I need to tell the president.

636
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:21,014
或许你得等等
Maybe you should hold off.

637
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:22,084
目前的危机又升级了
The domestic threat's been lifted for now

638
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:25,035
她正和史密斯上将通话
And she's on the phone with admiral smith.

639
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,002
我不能批准空中打击
I can't authorize the air strikes

640
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:32,002
除非我们出兵计划已经妥当
Until our post-invasion plans are in place.

641
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:36,032
在找到可行性方案之前
Finding a politically viable replacement, until that happens,

642
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:39,073
我要求军队全面戒备
You need to keep your forces at full readiness.

643
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:42,026
参谋长们已经等得不耐烦了
The joint chiefs are getting impatient.

644
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:46,061
总统阁下  我们需要谈谈您的丈夫
Madam president, we need to talk about your husband.

645
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:52,014
对于令郎的死
His theory about your son's death,

646
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:54,034
他还是难以释怀
He hasn't let it go.

647
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:57,001
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

648
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:59,092
他去质询罗杰的女友
He's been harassing roger's girlfriend,

649
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:04,029
认为她参与了罗杰的谋杀
Accusing her of complicity in the death of roger.

650
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,059
亨利和我跟着联调局
Henry and I went over it

651
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,012
一次又一次地调查
Again and again with the fbi,

652
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:10,043
后来他向我发誓 他不会再纠结于此了
And he swore to me He was past all that.

653
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:12,056
他找到了一个迎合他的
Well, he's found a private investigator who's feeding

654
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,076
谋杀理论的私人侦探
His conspiracy theory;

655
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:16,016
他在被人利用
Taking advantage of him.

656
00:32:16,078 --> 00:32:18,008
请让亨利来听电话
Please get henry on the phone.

657
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:21,012
恐怕不行
I'm afraid I can't do that.

658
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,026
我联系不上他
Henry's unreachable.

659
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:28,036
什么意思
I don't understand.

660
00:32:28,037 --> 00:32:30,086
盖奇探员的电话无人接听
Agent gedge hasn't been answering his phone.

661
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:34,063
我应该早点告诉你的
I probably should have told you before.

662
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:38,010
你是说我丈夫失踪了吗
You're telling me my husband's gone missing?

663
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:42,031
特勤组已经发出通告
Secret service has put out an apb.

664
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:45,054
他们正在去罗斯小姐的家中
They're going to ms. roth's apartment.

665
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:50,026
无论发生了什么  我都会很快查清
Whatever's going on, I will find out soon enough.

666
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:58,096
这是代号 查理-0-查理的优先命令
This is a priority order code charlie zero charlie.

667
00:32:58,097 --> 00:33:01,082
需要立即找到盖奇探员
We need an immediate 20 on agent gedge.

668
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,096
所有外勤探员立即出发
All available field agents proceed

669
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:09,000
至威尔金森路404号 代号 查理-0-查理
404 wilkinson drive. Code charlie zero charlie.

670
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,020
你正在犯错误
You're making a mistake.

671
00:34:22,057 --> 00:34:23,069
好好想想
Think about it.

672
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,073
闭嘴
Shut up!

673
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:25,076
你没杀过人
You haven't killed anybody yet.

674
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:27,047
你没必要这么做
You don't need to do this.

675
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:31,077
盖奇陷害我的计划已经失败了
Gedge's plan to frame me is already blown.

676
00:34:31,078 --> 00:34:34,020
如果你杀了我
If you kill me,

677
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:36,031
他们就会查出来这是谋杀
They'll know it was murder,

678
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,062
并会由此找到你
And they'll trace it back to you.

679
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:49,019
说
Go ahead.

680
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,079
盖奇探员去哪了  我联系不到他
Where's agent gedge? I can't reach him.

681
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,089
盖奇死了
Gedge is dead.

682
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,009
出什么事了
What happened?

683
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,043
本应按计划进行
Everything was going according to plan...

684
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:58,076
但还是了问题
But something went wrong.

685
00:34:58,077 --> 00:35:01,024
泰勒杀了盖奇  我不知道他怎么做到的
Taylor killed gedge; I don't know how.

686
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,023
泰勒先生现在在哪里
Where's mr. taylor now?

687
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:04,060
在我旁边
He's right here.

688
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:07,064
别杀他  把他带到我这
Don't kill him, bring him to me.

689
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,025
明白
Yes, sir.

690
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:30,000
马托波总理  夫人  请跟我来
Prime minister matobo, ma'am, please come with me.

691
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,014
克罗伊  用卫星查看瑞特大厦
Chloe, pull up the ritter building on a satellite grid.

692
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:36,004
查看杜巴库离开留下的痕迹
Look for any sign of dubaku leaving the site.

693
00:35:36,004 --> 00:35:37,051
我们必须找到他
We've got to find him.

694
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,088
我需要20分钟来设置卫星
It's going to take me 20 minutes to task the satellite.

695
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:41,031
那就别浪费口舌
Then don't waste time talking about it.

696
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:43,081
调出卫星和交通摄像头
Pull up satellite and traffic cams,

697
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,018
监视街角和汽车站
Street corners and metro stations.

698
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,022
先干什么
What's the priority?

699
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:48,005
我一次只能做一件事情
I can only do one thing at a time.

700
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:49,065
-卫星  -好吧
- Satellite!  - fine.

701
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:51,009
比尔  我们必须重新考虑一下
Bill, we need to rethink this.

702
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:52,049
你什么意思
What do you mean?

703
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,092
你原计划监控一次卧底行动
You were set up to surveil an undercover operation.

704
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:55,099
现在卧底身份暴露了
Your cover's been blown.

705
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,039
警察还在找我们
The police are after us.

706
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,020
我们无法在百万人口的城市找一个人
We are not equipped to look for one man in a city of millions.

707
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,090
我们需要其它的资源
We need additional resources.

708
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,007
你有何建议
What are you suggesting?

709
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:05,060
是时候和外面部门联系了
It's time to contact outside agencies.

710
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,060
-政府吗  -是的
- The government?  - yes.

711
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,037
我记得你说过政府是不可信的
I thought you said the government couldn't be trusted.

712
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,054
现在  我们别无选择
Right now, we don't have a choice.

713
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:12,057
我们不能相信它
It can't be trusted.

714
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:13,074
我们不能信任任何人
We can't trust anybody,

715
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:15,004
这就是为什么我们独自行动
That's why we're working on the outside.

716
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:16,095
泰勒总统可以被信任
President taylor can be trusted.

717
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:18,071
我并不怀疑这点  总理
I'm not questioning that, prime minister.

718
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:20,072
而是她身边的人无法被信任
It's the people around her who can't be trusted.

719
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:23,012
布坎南先生  杰克是对的  我们需要帮助
Mr. buchanan, jack's right. we need help.

720
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,039
这太危险了
It's too dangerous.

721
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,089
我们可以限制消息的去向
We can limit the flow of information.

722
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:28,072
总理可以帮我们
Prime minister matobo can get us past

723
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,089
直接向总统解释清楚
Explain to her why and what we're doing.

724
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,096
我觉得杰克是对的
I think jack's right.

725
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:34,083
我们在那栋楼里留下了太多的痕迹
We left a lot of clues in that building.

726
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,010
我们不能在冒险
We're vulnerable; we can't do this

727
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,023
单干下去了
On our own anymore.

728
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:39,030
难道我要和你们继续躲下去
Am I supposed to remain in hiding with you,

729
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,070
装成我和我夫人被绑架
Pretend that my wife and i

730
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,000
或被杀了吗
Are still being held hostage or dead?

731
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:46,048
我必须返回白宫
I need to return to the white house

732
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:48,054
帮助总统挽救我的国家
And help the president save what's left of my country.

733
00:36:48,054 --> 00:36:50,011
让我的丈夫去吧
Let my husband do this.

734
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:52,008
让他给泰勒总统打电话
Let him call president taylor.

735
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,052
她会听他的
She will listen to him.

736
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,066
比尔  要想找到杜巴库  让他打电话
Bill, you want to find dubaku, make the call.

737
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:13,050
好吧
All right.

738
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,020
给我接白宫
Get me the white house.

739
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:21,098
博伊德化工厂的代表们
Representatives from boyd chemical

740
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:23,058
向当地政府部门保证
Have assured local authorities

741
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:25,071
当前危机已经过去了
That the immediate crisis has passed.

742
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:27,082
但这仍无法缓解汲沦谷镇
However, this has done little to calm the nerves

743
00:37:27,082 --> 00:37:30,065
民众的紧张情绪
Of the citizens of kidron, ohio,

744
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:34,032
他们中的许多人跑到附近的社区避难
Many of whom have taken shelter in neighboring communities.

745
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:36,029
我们再次确认只有一人
Again, we have confirmed one fatality

746
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:37,066
在工厂内死亡
Inside the plant itself.

747
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,080
其它13名博伊德的员工正在当地的
13 others, all boyd employees,

748
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,056
医疗中心接受救治
Are being treated at local medical centers...

749
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:43,020
-总统阁下  -请讲
- Madam president. - Yes?

750
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,007
马托波总理希望和您通话
I have prime minister matobo calling for you.

751
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:47,010
马托波
Matobo?!

752
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,010
是的  阁下
Yes, ma'am.

753
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,044
你能追踪电话吗
You're tracing it?

754
00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:51,094
我们试了  总统阁下  但它是保密线路
We tried, madame president, but it's a secure line.

755
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:54,007
接进来
Put him through.

756
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,005
总理
Prime minister?

757
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,051
是我  总统阁下
Yes, madame president.

758
00:37:57,051 --> 00:37:58,071
你没事吧
Are you all right?

759
00:37:58,071 --> 00:38:00,055
感谢上帝  我和我夫人都好
Thank god my wife and I are both fine.

760
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:01,062
我们被救了
We were rescued.

761
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:03,012
被谁
By whom?

762
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:04,032
你在哪里
Where are you?

763
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,039
一个安全的地方
In a safe place.

764
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:10,026
总统阁下  请您听我讲
Madame president, you need to listen to me.

765
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:13,056
救我的人拿到了CIP装置
The people who rescued us, they have acquired the cip device.

766
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:15,003
它已经被摧毁了
It has been destroyed,

767
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:18,037
贵国当前的危机已经过去了
And your country is no longer under immediate threat.

768
00:38:18,037 --> 00:38:21,067
他们是谁  告诉我这到底怎么回事
Who are these people, and tell me how this happened.

769
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,081
我会当面向您禀告的
I will tell you everything in person,

770
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:26,011
但是  必须是私下里
But, uh, this must happen privately.

771
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:27,034
我必须只和您一人谈
I must speak to you alone.

772
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:29,038
为什么不能有其他人
Why alone?

773
00:38:29,038 --> 00:38:32,025
他们会带我过去  总统阁下
They will bring me to you, madame president.

774
00:38:32,025 --> 00:38:34,005
我们会在10分钟内到达
We will arrive in ten minutes.

775
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:36,012
恭候大驾
I'll be waiting for you.

776
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:40,066
他们试图追踪电话  但没成功
They tried to trace the call, but the line held.

777
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:46,033
伊桑  马上来见我
Ethan, I need to see you right now.

778
00:38:53,084 --> 00:38:55,020
怎么了  总统阁下
Yes, madame president?

779
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,027
我刚和马托波总理通了电话
I just spoke to prime minister matobo.

780
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:00,001
什么
What?!

781
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,018
他很安全
He's safe.

782
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:02,078
怎么回事  发生什么事了
How? what happened?

783
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,078
等他到的时候会告诉我们
He'll let us know when he gets here.

784
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:06,068
他在路上  他希望私下见面
He's on his way now. he wants a private meeting.

785
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:08,092
把他从南门带进来
Bring him in through the south entrance,

786
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:11,012
别走漏了消息
And keep this to as few people as possible.

787
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:13,052
好的
All right.

788
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:20,060
杰克  我给你制定了一条到白宫的路线
Jack, I've mapped a route for you to the white house.

789
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,070
大部分是小巷
It's mostly side streets,

790
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,017
但还是有一些交通摄像头
But there will be fewer traffic cams.

791
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:24,080
好的  发到我手机上
Okay, good. send it to my phone.

792
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,024
准备好了  我们走吧
We're ready. let's go.

793
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:28,070
我们把车开到楼前
As soon as we set the vehicle in front of the building,

794
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,024
沃克探员就带马托波先生上车
Agent walker will move mr. matobo.

795
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:31,074
杰克  杰克
Jack... jack!

796
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:33,024
怎么了
What?

797
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:35,038
我哪都不去
I'm not going.

798
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:38,021
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

799
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,002
如果政府发现了托尼
If the government gets their hands on tony,

800
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,025
他们会逮捕他
They'll arrest him.

801
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:42,085
我告诉过你
I already told you--

802
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:45,069
和比尔合作前我干了不少坏事
I did some pretty bad things before I teamed up with bill.

803
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:47,082
托尼  相信我
Tony, take it from me...

804
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:49,096
你必须面对这个结果
You need to deal with the consequences.

805
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,076
你也要相信我  我会的
And believe me, I will.

806
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:53,066
但不是现在  等抓到杜巴库后
But not yet. not till we get dubaku.

807
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:55,010
我有条线索
I'm working on a lead.

808
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,027
我找到了爱默生手下的一个小子
I've got a guy on emerson's crew

809
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,017
他或许能提供一些线索
Who might have some intel we can use.

810
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:00,044
让他继续查吧  杰克
Let him do this, jack.

811
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:03,054
我们能有今天多亏了他
He's the reason we got this far.

812
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:07,018
好吧
Fine.

813
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:09,061
但你得保证这事一结束
But you give me your word as soon as this as over,

814
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:10,091
你就去自首
You turn yourself in.

815
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,055
我们会支持你的
We'll stand behind you.

816
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:16,065
好的  我保证
All right, you have my word.

817
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:21,036
祝你好运  多加小心
Good luck. be careful.

818
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:16,075
我在上班的路上
I was on my way to work, so I thought

819
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:17,088
就顺便来看下你
I'd stop in and see you.

820
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:19,058
我早些时候试图打你手机
I tried calling you earlier.

821
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:21,005
对不起  今天比较忙
I'm sorry; I've been busy.

822
00:41:21,005 --> 00:41:23,022
你还好吧  你看上去很累
Are you all right? you look exhausted.

823
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,052
今天事多了点
It's just been a long day.

824
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:27,082
好吧  我还是想你来吃晚餐
Well, I hope you're still coming over for dinner.

825
00:41:27,082 --> 00:41:29,053
我会做烤宽面条
I'm making lasagna.

826
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,093
我姐姐也保证不会再给你脸色看
And my sister promises not to give you any more dirty looks.

827
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:35,093
你不会忘了吧
You haven't forgotten, have you?

828
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,043
没  没
No. no.

829
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:39,057
我现在有点事要处理
It's just that I've got some business to attend to.

830
00:41:39,057 --> 00:41:41,084
塞缪尔  你工作太辛苦了
Samuel, you work too much.

831
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,074
每次你来吃晚饭
Every time you come into the dinner,

832
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:45,027
你总是在接电话
You're always on the phone.

833
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:46,051
我不得不这么做  玛丽亚
I have to, maria,

834
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:48,058
只有这样  有一天我才能把你
So that, one day, I can finally take you away

835
00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:50,021
从你工作的鬼地方解救出来
From that awful place that you work in.

836
