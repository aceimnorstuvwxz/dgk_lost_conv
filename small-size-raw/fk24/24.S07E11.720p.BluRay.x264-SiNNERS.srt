朱玛将军要是知道你放弃任务

你要她去找杜巴库吗
You want her to go to him and face him?

19
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:41,017
这是我们在他人间蒸发之前
It's the only chance we have of finding him before

你要保证她的安全  听见了吗

22
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:45,087
一定
We will.

能把文件上传到联调局吗
Can you upload the files to fbi?

32
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:13,020
玛丽卡死了
Marika didn't make it.

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,017
-你害死了我妹妹  -我很抱歉
- You killed my sister. - I'm so sorry.

34
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,028
你究竟想干吗
What do you want from me?!

35
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:18,031
我只想知道你还有点人味儿

我想知道你和我有同样的切肤之痛

我和联调局合作

协助进行内部地毯式搜捕
To coordinate an interagency sweep.

40
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:30,002
我们应该在一小时之内开始实施逮捕
We should start making arrests within the hour.

41
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:32,069
对于今天你的付出   我们会没齿难忘

我要你告诉参议员迈尔

杰克·鲍尔协助我们拯救了这个国家

47
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:44,053
他不该在监狱里度过余生

48
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:46,027
-我要去白宫  -什么
- I'm going to the white house. - Sir?

行动时间是晚上7点
That the window opens at 1900 hours.

56
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:59,068
目标是什么
What's the target?

57
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,048
他不清楚具体目标
He doesn't know the exact target,

58
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:03,085
但肯定是袭击价值高
But it's definitely going to be of high value

59
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,046
能造成巨大影响的东西

梅医生  他有事问你

74
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:58,052
医生真是没用
Doctors are so helpless.

75
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,052
梅医生
Dr. may?

76
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:03,019
喂

没人啊
There was no one there.

78

要是他打过来

Code blue! we have a code blue in the icu!

82
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:19,064
叫沃克探员马上赶到重症监护室
Get agent walker down to icu now!

83
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:24,068
迅速果断是五角大楼对此次正在
Swift and decisive is how the pentagon describes

84
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:27,064
进军桑加拉行动的描述
The u.s. invasion now underway in sangala.

85
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:30,030
零星的抵抗  最小的伤亡
"sporadic resistance, minimal casualties."

86
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,015
这直接与桑加拉领导人
This in direct contrast to assertions made

87
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:34,089
本杰明·朱玛在国家电视台
By sangalese leader benjamin juma

88
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,032
做出的断言形成鲜明对比
On state-supported television.

89
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:39,072
我们勇敢的士兵将击退
Our brave soldiers are beating back the enemy

90
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:41,099
所有入侵桑加拉的军队
All across sangala city.

91
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,066
历史将由我们谱写  我的朋友
History is on our side, my friends.

92
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:47,013
曾经我们能在美国佬的贩奴船上生还
We survived their slave ships,

93
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:50,004
今天也同样能在他们船坚炮利下幸存
And we will survive their warships, too.

94
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:54,034
当自己的部队弃城而逃  城市一片废墟时
Declaring victory while his own troops are fleeing the capital,

95
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,014
他还在这儿宣扬胜利
And his palace lies in ruins.

96
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:58,018
这个视频是什么时候录的
When do we think this was made?

97
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:00,028
我估计视频是在
My guess is these recordings were made

98
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:02,011
我们进攻之前录制的  总统阁下
Some time before the invasion, ma'am.

99
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:04,034
问题来了  约翰
Which begs the question, john.

100
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,072
他现在在哪  为什么我现在还抓不到他
Where is he, and why haven't we found him yet?

101
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:08,012
特种部队正在桑加拉展开全城搜捕
Special forces teams all over sangala city

102
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:09,052
搜寻他的藏身之处
Are searching for him.

103
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,052
有情报称
There is some intelligence to suggest

104
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,039
他可能已经逃离国内了
He may have fled the country.

105
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,056
史密斯上将
Admiral smith, you and i

106
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:18,066
你我都清楚必须抓到朱玛
Both know that juma must be captured.

107
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,082
我们必须要对他侵犯人权的罪恶行径
He must be tried and convicted

108
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:21,010
进行审判和定罪
of his crimes against humanity

109
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,020
否则  我们一样很失败
Otherwise, we've as good as failed.

110
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,044
他跑不远的  总统阁下
He can't go far, ma'am.

111
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,041
世界上没有一个国家会给他提供政治庇护
No country on earth will grant him asylum.

112
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,074
那就抓住他  史密斯上将
Then find him, admiral smith.

113
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,074
无论天涯海角
Wherever he is.

114
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,028
朱玛将军
General juma?

115
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:40,055
景色迷人  不是吗
Beautiful, isn't it?

116
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:41,099
什么
Sir?

117
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:44,026
我可不是跟你闹着玩  劳伦特
It's not a trick question, laurent.

118
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,016
真的很迷人
It is beautiful.

119
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,056
不是吗
Why not?

120
00:04:49,063 --> 00:04:51,063
时间快到了
It is almost time.

121
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:54,020
弟兄们  他们都准备好了吗
The men-- are they ready?

122
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,083
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

123
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,047
他们害怕吗
Are they afraid?

124
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:01,040
我不知道  但是有些人在祈祷
I don't know, sir, but some of them are praying.

125
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:05,087
害怕是好事
It's good if they are afraid.

126
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,098
意味着他们会奋勇杀敌
It means they will fight bravely.

127
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,032
长官  你有我父亲的消息吗
Have you heard from my father yet, sir?

128
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:14,019
我以为他会在这儿跟我们会面的
I thought he was supposed to be meeting us here.

129
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,019
别担心  劳伦特
Don't worry, laurent.

130
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,022
他会来的
He will be here.

131
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:20,059
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

132
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,025
什么事
Yes.

133
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,069
-杜巴库上校死了  -你确定吗
Colonel dubaku is dead. Are you certain?

134
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,026
我用的药可是致命的
The dose i administered was catastrophic.

135
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:34,046
他儿子刚才还问我呢
His son just asked me about him.

136
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:36,046
永远不要让他知道这事
He must never know about this,

137
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:38,086
还有他父亲是个懦夫
Or about his father's cowardice.

138
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:40,013
他不会知道的
He won't.

139
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,072
那就没什么能妨碍咱们了
Then nothing will stand in our way,

140
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,090
乌铎  但是要抓紧
udo. but hurry.

141
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,034
攻击行动时间快到了
The attack window is narrowing.

142
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:46,071
时间必须精确
The timing must be precise.

143
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:48,071
-退后  -明白  长官
- Clear! - yes, sir.

144
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:54,018
退后
Clear.

145
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:57,015
再来一次  360伏
One more time at 360.

146
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:00,019
退后
Clear.

147
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,085
不行
Nothing.

148
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:05,022
再来一次吗  医生
Going again, doctor?

149
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:08,059
不用了
No.

150
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,086
就这样了  各位  宣布死亡
That's it, everybody. i'm calling it.

151
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,083
死亡时间  下午6点
time death 06 p.m.

152
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,011
斯塔尔医生  怎么回事
Dr. stahl, what's going on?

153
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,067
严重的心脏病发作
A massive heart attack.

154
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,034
你说过他情况稳定就会好转
You said that he was stable, that he was going to be okay.

155
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,022
这又是怎么了
So, what happened?

156
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:19,042
我不知道
I'm not sure.

157
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,023
可能有些没预料到的情况
Maybe a preexisting condition.

158
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,079
验尸报告会说明一切  失陪
The autopsy will tell us. Excuse me.

159
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,055
大规模腐败稽查
The wide extent of the corruption

160
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,052
需要联合行动
requires a coordinated approach.

161
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:32,009
政府已经被渗透
We know the government's been compromised.

162
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,092
但我们还不知道有多少内鬼
We just don't know at what level.

163
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,076
现在  克罗伊·奥布赖恩正在逐个部门
Presently, Chloe O'brian is vetting the names

164
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:36,096
审查名单
Department by department.

165
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,023
我已经予以特勤局优先权
I'm prioritizing secret service,

166
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,023
总统的安全将很快得到保障
so the president is secured as soon as possible.

167
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:43,007
各部负责人会接到指令
Team leaders will then receive their assignments--

168
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,063
包括国防部  财政部  国务院等等
defense, treasury, state,et cetera and make

169
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:49,057
在整个华府地区同时实施抓捕
their arrests contemporaneously across the district.

170
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,071
-我是奥布赖恩  -克罗伊  我是杰克
O'brian. Chloe, it's Jack.

171
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,088
杜巴库数据库里的名单传给
Have the names from Dubaku's database been handed over

172
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,082
逮捕小组了没
to the arrest teams yet?

173
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:00,037
-还没  -好  听我说
- Not yet. - Okay, listen to me.

174
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:02,028
我刚刚得知朱玛团伙正在计划新一轮攻击
I've just learned that Juma's operatives are planning another attack.

175
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:04,065
杰克  他们说这一切就要结束了
Jack, they're telling us here it's over.

176
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,091
不对  托尼给我提供了情报来源
That's wrong. Tony's my source on the intel.

177
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,096
你知道他们的目标吗
Do you know what the target is?

178
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,092
只知道那是代价高  伤亡大的地方
Only that it's high value, high casualty, and that

179
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,086
危机正在酝酿中  所以我需要你帮我
it's happening now, which is why I need your help.

180
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:14,010
名单上有个叫莱恩·伯内特的
There's a man on the list, a Ryan Burnett.

181
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,010
他是迈尔议员的办公室主任
He's Senator Mayer's Chief of Staff.

182
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,063
迈尔  他不就是今早在参议院小组听证会上
Mayer? Isn't he the guy who grilled you this morning

183
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,014
盘问你的那个人吗
at the senate subcommittee hearing?

184
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,027
没错  但他不是同谋
Yeah, but the Senator's not implicated in the conspiracy.

185
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,071
不过伯内特一直在
But Burnett has been providing support

186
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,014
支持朱玛和杜巴库
for Juma and Dubaku all along.

187
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:27,044
克罗伊  我要你从名单里删掉他的名字
Chloe, I need you to delete his name from the list.

188
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:29,044
什么  为什么
What? Why?

189
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:31,059
一旦调查局对他下手  他的律师就会赶到
If the FBI start to move in on him, he'll lawyer up,

190
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,029
这样一来没人能及时得知任何情报
and no one will get the information on time.

191
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,055
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

192
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:36,065
他和参议员一起在白宫
He's at the white house with the Senator.

193
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,095
他们要和总统会面
They've got a meeting with the president.

194
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,049
我正去那儿  准备盘问比尔
I'm on my way there now to be debriefed by Bill.

195
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,019
我会搞定他的
I'll take care of him then.

196
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:44,012
杰克  你不会是想在白宫审嫌犯吧
Jack, you don't expect to interrogate a suspect in the white house?

197
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,016
交给我了
Let me handle that.

198
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,050
克罗伊  删掉他的名字
Chloe, just get his name deleted from the list.

199
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,066
我会再打给你的
I'll get back to you.

200
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,006
她也入伙了
She's in.

201
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:31,063
-有进展吗  -快了
- How close are we? -Close.

202
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:33,027
有什么我能帮忙的吗
Is there anything I can do to help?

203
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,021
我正在浏览资料的最后一页
I'm just cycling through the last layer of data now.

204
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,042
你看  要是你把分组完毕的资料
You know, it might be quicker

205
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,035
一个个发到我的工作台可能会快点
if you send the subsets to my station one by one.

206
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:40,065
好主意
Good idea.

207
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:41,039
之后
And then that way

208
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,072
我就可以分发它们了
I can get to work on distributing them.

209
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,040
-好吧  -多谢
Okay, then. Thank you.

210
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:05,018
听着  杰克  你得再考虑一下
Listen, Jack, maybe you should reconsider.

211
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:07,005
考虑什么
Reconsider what?

212
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,029
相信比尔
Taking Bill into your confidence.

213
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,094
我是说  他从一开始
Look, I mean, he's been a part

214
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,031
就一直在参与这次行动
of this operation since the get-go.

215
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:18,027
我不知道得用啥手段才能撬开伯内特的嘴
I don't know what it's going to take to get Burnett to talk.

216
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,043
如果我必须用极端手法的话
If I have to use extreme measures...

217
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:22,057
我不明白  你怎就觉得他一定会去那儿呢
I don't get it. What, you don't think he'll go there?

218
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:25,029
我正一步步走向悬崖  托尼
I'm driving off a cliff here, Tony.

219
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,023
我没必要把比尔也拉下水
I don't need to put Bill in the passenger seat.

220
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:31,064
好吧  我会和你去
All right, then, fine. I'll go with you.

221
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:33,093
你是个被通缉的重犯
You're a wanted felon.

222
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:36,011
你连第一道安检都过不去
You wouldn't get past the first checkpoint.

223
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:37,095
除此之外  现在所有政府部门
Besides, with all of the government agencies

224
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:40,001
仍旧被渗透  也许可以靠你自己
still compromised, it might be up to you

225
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:42,042
阻止这次袭击
to stop the attack.

226
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,022
永别了
See you on the other side.

227
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
喂
Yes?

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,097
能延长袭击的行动时间吗
Can you extend the attack window?

229
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,000
那可能会影响整个计划
Not without risking the entire operation.

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,070
干嘛
Why?

231
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,014
事情有点棘手了
There's been a complication.

232
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:05,091
我不能按预计的那样按时动身了
I may be stuck here longer than I anticipated.

233
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:07,091
我会再打给你的
I'll call you back.

234
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:09,024
卡宁先生
Mr. Kanin.

235
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,088
我是莱恩·伯内特  迈尔议员的办公室主任
Ryan Burnett, Senator Mayer's Chief of Staff.

236
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:14,006
-我们通过电话  -不止一次
- We've spoken on the phone. - Many times.

237
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,018
见到你真好
It's good to finally meet you.

238
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:16,046
我也是  参议员在里面
Likewise. The Senator's inside.

239
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:18,025
跟我来
Right this way.

240
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,076
参议员
Senator?

241
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:28,063
参议员  在喝酒啊
Well, Senator, I see you've found the bar.

242
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:31,003
我也来一杯好吗
Mind if I join you?

243
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:35,034
这酒我还没见过
Something I never knew.

244
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,014
不是肯塔基州来的就不能算是波旁威士忌
If it ain't from Kentucky, you can't call it Bourbon.

245
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:41,003
伊桑  少跟我来你南方佬那一套
Spare me the southern gentleman routine, Ethan.

246
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,071
总统让我在这个天杀的傍晚
The president didn't call me up here

247
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:44,044
来这儿可不是一边喝酒一边
at the ass-end of the day to drink her booze

248
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,091
浏览一个简报
and flip through a briefing book.

249
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,097
在会前这可能会对你有帮助
I thought it might be helpful, before your meeting,

250
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:49,064
让你能了解
to bring you up to speed

251
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,029
最近十小时发生的事情
on the events of the last ten hours.

252
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,029
好吧
Okay.

253
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:55,092
我已经了解了
I'm up to speed.

254
00:10:57,053 --> 00:11:00,013
参议员  你一定对你刚才
Senator, surely you have some reaction

255
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:02,016
读到的东西有些感想吧
to what you just read.

256
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:04,073
我当然有
Damn right I have a reaction.

257
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:07,040
我想知道这一切和杰克·鲍尔有何瓜葛
I want to know what all this has to do with Jack Bauer.

258
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,074
这也是我来此的原因  对吗
I mean, that's the reason I'm here, right?

259
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:12,034
没有鲍尔先生  我们不可能
Without Mr. Bauer, we would never have uncovered

260
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:14,024
首先揭穿阴谋
the conspiracy in the first place

261
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:15,078
更不可能找到幕后主使
nor the people behind it.

262
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:17,082
正是有了他与联调局合力联手
His efforts, in conjunction

263
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:19,087
才促成了现在
with those of the FBI, are largely responsible

264
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:22,054
正在进行的华府内的大搜捕
for the arrests being made right now across the district.

265
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:26,032
你不会是说他是奉旨办事吧
You're not saying that he's acting in an official capacity?

266
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:29,039
我不用告诉你这意味着什么吧  伊桑
I don't have to tell you how this looks, Ethan.

267
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,076
与解散的前反恐组流氓探员狼狈为奸
Colluding with a rogue operative from a disbanded agency.

268
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:34,050
很遗憾你这么看问题
I'm sorry you see it that way.

269
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,050
我还能怎么看这个问题
How else am I supposed to see it?

270
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,037
依照总统的看法
The way the president does--

271
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:41,037
杰克·鲍尔救百姓于水火  这显而易见
that Jack Bauer saved lives today, plain and simple,

272
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:44,024
其中也包括救了她丈夫
including her husband's.

273
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:48,009
我知道  参议员  这对你来说很难接受
Look, Senator, I know this isn't easy for you.

274
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,074
你发起的反对
The public battle you've waged

275
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:52,021
被拘留人员受虐以及违背人权的斗争
against detainee abuse and human rights violations...

276
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,068
你是郑重要求我
Are you seriously asking me

277
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:57,009
改变立场吗
to look the other way on this?

278
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,095
我追查这个混蛋好些年了
I have been after this son of a bitch for years.

279
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,069
他是个恶棍  伊桑
He's a thug, Ethan.

280
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:04,042
他是头号公敌
He's exhibit "a."

281
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:11,000
总统已经准备好改变政策
The president is prepared to reverse policy

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,090
支持你关于战争犯罪的修正案
and support your amendment to the war crimes act.

283
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,094
交换条件是什么
In exchange for what exactly?

284
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:18,021
听证会
The hearings.

285
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,064
宣布休会至假期后
Declare a recess till after the holidays

286
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:24,045
接着悄悄等鲍尔先生的传票作废
And then quietly let Mr. Bauer's subpoena expire.

287
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:26,011
要是我拒绝合作呢
And if I refuse to go along?

288
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,058
总统也做好了
The president is prepared

289
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:29,048
使用行政特权的准备
to invoke executive privilege.

290
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,005
行政特权具体指什么
Executive privilege--meaning what exactly?

291
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:34,059
那就由总统决定了
Well,that's for the president to decide.

292
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,059
你是说赦免吗
Are you talking about a pardon?

293
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:39,079
不排除这种可能
I wouldn't rule it out.

294
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,003
如果总统想耍花样
Well, if that's how the president wants to play it,

295
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:46,027
你可以告诉她她遇到对手了
You can tell her she just walked into a street fight.

296
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:49,057
你可以自己跟她说
You can tell her yourself.

297
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,075
杰克
Jack.

298
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:04,099
-你好比尔  -你比我预期的来得早
Hi, bill. you got here sooner than i expected.

299
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:10,026
-杰克 -放下武器
- Jack. - Put down your weapon now!

300
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:13,090
离桌子远点
Step away from the desk!

301
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,073
坐下
Take a seat.

302
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:17,090
比尔  坐下
Sit down, bill!

303
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,034
好  好  我坐下了
Okay, okay, i'm sitting.

304
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:21,044
到底发生了什么事
Now, what's this all about?

305
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:23,000
莱恩·伯内特在哪
Where is ryan burnett? what?

306
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,091
参议员的办公室主任  他在哪
Senator mayer's chief of staff-- where is he?

307
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,057
我不会说的
I'm not saying anything until you tell me

308
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,057
除非你告诉我到底发生了什么事
What the hell's going on.

309
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,084
托尼从他的线人口中
Tony doubled back to one of his contacts,

310
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:31,085
知道有第二次袭击
Who gave him information of a second attack.

311
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:34,042
一个小时内会在华盛顿发动袭击
It's going to take place here in washington within the hour.

312
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,032
这次是朱玛的手下
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.

313
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,004
伯内特一直在暗中支持他们
Burnett's been supporting them all along.

314
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,079
他知道下一次袭击会在哪里发生
He knows where the attack's going to take place, so you can

315
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:43,029
你如果不说出他的下落  我会自己找
Either tell me where he is or i will find him myself.

316
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,073
我不能说  杰克
Jack, I can't.

317
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:49,023
手放背后
Fine, put your hands behind your back now.

318
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,021
情报准确吗
How good is the intel?

319
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:54,037
这情报值得我找他谈谈的了
Good enough for me to need to talk to him.

320
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:56,007
不要动
Don't you move.

321
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:59,082
杰克  让我逮捕他吧
Jack, let me have him arrested.

322
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:01,064
我们还可以想想别的办法
There are other ways to deal with this.

323
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:04,078
袭击已经破在眉睫  我们没时间了
The attack window's open. We're out of time.

324
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:08,005
杰克  听我说
Jack, listen to me.

325
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:10,032
我为你的事情和总统谈过了
I spoke to the president on your behalf.

326
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,052
她会和迈尔参议员谈
She's going to intervene with senator mayer,

327
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,099
关于停止你的听证会的事
Stop the hearings.

328
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:17,029
你可以重获新生了
You can get your life back.

329
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,019
你现在这么做等于自毁前程啊
You do this, you're throwing it all away.

330
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,006
我希望还有另一种选择
I wish I thought there was another option.

331
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:24,023
至少让我帮你  杰克
Let me help you at least, jack.

332
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,074
你不用一个人面对
You don't have to do this alone.

333
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,034
是的  我必须一个人
Yes, i do.

334
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:33,068
这是唯一一个能不让你受到牵连的方法
It's the only way i can make sure to keep you Out of this.

335
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:35,051
-杰克 -比尔  对不起
- Jack. - Bill, i'm sorry.

336
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:36,091
杰克  等  等一下
Jack, w-w-wait!

337
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,031
杰克
Jack!

338
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,088
没事的
It's all right.

339
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,045
不要反抗了
Don't fight it.

340
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:20,028
我是莫斯
This is Moss.

341
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,045
拉里  是我
Larry, it's me.

342
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,082
杜巴库死了
Dubaku's dead.

343
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:25,032
医生不是说他已经稳定下来了吗
I thought the doctors said he was stabilized.

344
00:15:25,032 --> 00:15:26,032
发生什么事了
What happened?

345
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,062
医院方面说
Officially,

346
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:28,099
他死于冠状动脉
They're characterizing that it was a coronary

347
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:30,063
破裂引起的系统性休克
Brought on by systemic shock.

348
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,050
好像你并不相信啊
Sounds like you don't believe it.

349
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,013
我和医院主管部门确认了一下
I did a follow-up with the hospital admin.

350
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,097
她确定杜巴库死的时候
She confirmed that there was an eight-member team on duty

351
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:37,000
有一个八人组在值班
When dubaku flatlined.

352
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
然后呢
Yeah?

353
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,040
在重症病房里有第九个人
There was a ninth man in the icu

354
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,004
正巧在急救信号之前出现  是个护理人员
Just before the code was called-- an orderly.

355
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,041
我重新看了一下监护室的录像带
I ran back the tapes on the ward

356
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,067
发现了那第九个人
And that's when i spotted him.

357
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,094
关键是周围没人知道他是谁
The things is I've asked around and nobody seems to know who he is.

358
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:49,028
蕾妮  你是在说杜巴库是被人谋杀的吗
Renee, wait, a-are you saying you think dubaku was murdered?

359
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:52,032
我是说杜巴库心跳停止的时候
I'm saying that there was an unidentified man in with dubaku

360
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:54,005
一个不明身份的人却在他旁边
Just before he went into cardiac arrest.

361
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:56,085
医院主管怎么说
What does the admin say?

362
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:59,069
他说他们经常从其他地区医院
She says that they often use floaters-- Personnel from other area hospitals

363
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,039
借用临时工
Filling in from time to time.

364
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,003
他们认为正式员工不认识他
Said it's not uncommon for the regular staff

365
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,063
也没什么奇怪的
Not to know who they are.

366
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,083
她在复审员工名单
She's double-checking with payroll now.

367
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,060
这样不就有答案了吗
Right, so there's your answer.

368
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,020
我还是觉得不对劲
Still it seems odd.

369
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,010
我是说  万一杜巴库知道些什么
I mean, what if dubaku knew something

370
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,067
所以招来杀身之祸
And they needed to shut him up?

371
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:15,014
这又是鲍尔的理论对吧
Is this bauer's theory, too?

372
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:17,004
他甚至都不在这
Jack's not even here

373
00:16:17,004 --> 00:16:18,081
拉里  我讨厌你这么妄加猜疑
And, you know, I resent that implication, larry.

374
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:19,072
我没说什么呀
What implication is that?

375
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:20,071
你的意思就是说我是个傀儡了
I am not the one calling the shots.

376
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:22,071
这从一开始就是我的案子
This has been my investigation from the beginning,

377
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,071
不是杰克·鲍尔的
Not jack bauer's.

378
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:24,081
我就是问问而已
I was just asking a question.

379
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,052
代表不了什么
I wasn't implying anything.

380
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:32,086
-你在吗  -对不起
- You there? - I'm sorry.

381
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:34,076
我对这件事有点敏感
I guess i'm a little sensitive on the subject.

382
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,040
我们已经了解了杜巴库所知道的一切
Look, everything we needed from dubaku, we got.

383
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,043
所有被他收买的政府官员名字和银行帐户
Names and bank accounts Of every corrupt official on his payroll.

384
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,030
现在正把他们缉拿归案呢
Teams are in the field as we speak.

385
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,070
你是说你让我回去吗
So you're saying you want me to come in.

386
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,024
我们这边需要你的帮助逮捕那些犯人
We need you back in the office sooner than later

387
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:48,041
越早越好
To help process all these arrests.

388
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,021
拉里  我让保安搜查了整个医院
Larry, look, I've got security searching the hospital

389
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,038
并检查了大量监控录像
And reviewing more video.

390
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,024
你要继续追那条线索吗
So, what, you want to follow that up first?

391
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:55,091
好吧  查明之后向我回报
Fine, call me when you clear it. yeah.

392
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:56,091
我会的
I will.

393
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:58,001
拉里  谢谢
Thanks, larry.

394
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:59,032
打扰一下  沃克探员
Excuse me, agent walker?

395
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:00,058
我们停车场的监视器
That orderly you were looking for

396
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:01,082
拍到了你要找的那个护理人员
One of our parking lot cameras

397
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:04,009
-上车时的画面  -什么时候
- Picked him up getting into his car. - When?

398
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:05,092
大概15分钟之前
Uh, about 15 minutes ago. i've got a screen grab

399
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,069
有一个探头拍下了他的车牌号
Of his license plate.

400
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:12,056
谢谢
Thank you.

401
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,027
我是沃克探员
This is agent walker.

402
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:17,067
帮我接下汽车管理局
Put me through to our DMV contact.

403
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:24,014
你在忙吗
Are you busy?

404
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:26,021
我正在重置服务器
I'm just reformatting the server,

405
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,068
所以比较忙  有事吗
So, yeah, I guess I am busy. why?

406
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:30,095
我在比对杜巴库提供的海外帐户
Well, I was cross-referencing Dubaku's offshore accounts

407
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:33,022
我查到一个残留标题信息
And i came across an orphaned header fragment.

408
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,025
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

409
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:35,065
你看一下
Take a look.

410
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:42,096
看见了吗  就在那  在那
Okay, see, there, right there, right there.

411
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:44,063
一个残留的标题
It's a remnant file header.

412
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,030
有可能那只是一个虚拟数据串而已
It's probably just a phantom data string.

413
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,033
不是的
No, it isn't.

414
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,037
我做过系统分析
I ran a systems analysis.

415
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,017
编码不是随机的
The coding is not random.

416
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:52,030
可以通过它
It can be traced back

417
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,040
追踪到一个帐户
To one of the accounts.

418
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,080
也就是说一个名字
Also, it looks like a name was deleted

419
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,001
被人从名单上删除了
From the list.

420
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,034
我来修复它吧
Why don't I run a recovery program?

421
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:00,088
你正在忙着重置系统
Well, you're very busy with the reformatting and all,

422
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:04,048
让我上传到我的工作站那边修复吧
So why don't I just upload it to my station and take care of it there?

423
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:07,055
不碍事  我这比较快
Well, that's okay, i can do it faster.

424
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,012
恕我冒犯
No offense.

425
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:12,022
我恢复资料的时候会通知你的
I'll let you know if I retrieve anything.

426
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:15,072
好吧
Sure.

427
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:17,043
谢谢
Thanks.

428
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:20,023
谢谢
Thank you.

429
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,021
请讲
Yeah.

430
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,008
你抓到伯内特了吗
Have you gotten to Burnett yet?

431
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:33,015
还没有
Working on it.

432
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:34,075
正在去白宫的路上
Making my way over to the west wing.

433
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:35,099
这有人发现
Someone here has figured out

434
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:37,035
数据库中少了一个名字
That a name has been deleted from the database.

435
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:39,002
我不知道还能稳住她多久
I don't know how much longer i can hold her off.

436
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:40,016
他们知道是伯内特吗
Do they know it was burnett?

437
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:41,099
不  可这只是时间问题
No, but it's just a matter of time.

438
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,059
好  我回头找你
Okay, i'll get back to you.

439
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,043
好
Great.

440
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,013
参议员  我要回一趟国会找桑迪
Senator, i'll head back to the hill and get with sandy.

441
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:51,057
你开完会前
We should have a press release drafted

442
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:52,064
得先起草完一份新闻发布稿
By the time you finish your meeting.

443
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,071
我还准备和你的朋友豪瑟面谈
I'm also going to need a sit-down with your friend hauser at the post.

444
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:57,071
不要声张   对吧
Off the record, i assume.

445
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,098
我们得把赦免杰克的行为视作
We've got to make pardoning jack bauer as politically toxic

446
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,028
危害总统的政治毒瘤
For the president as possible.

447
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:05,085
她现在很情绪化
She's a woman in a highly emotional state.

448
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:07,028
她丈夫刚被枪击
Her husband's been shot.

449
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:08,029
你是说她判断力也会受影响吗
You suggesting her judgment's impaired?

450
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:11,006
我建议我们可以就此弹劾总统了
I'm suggesting that a case could be made.

451
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:12,076
打搅一下  参议员
Excuse me, senator.

452
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:14,039
泰勒总统有请
President taylor is ready to see you now.

453
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,039
去吧  参议员
Go ahead, senator.

454
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,053
我会把这带给司法部长
I'll get this to the ag,

455
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:18,006
告诉他你选择继续
Tell him you want the option to go ahead

456
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,013
明天按原计划参加听证会
With the hearings tomorrow as scheduled.

457
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,053
谢谢  莱恩
Thanks, ryan.

458
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,024
喂
Yes?

459
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:31,024
我是伯内特
It's burnett.

460
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:32,031
你解决后患了吗
You took care of the problem?

461
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:33,051
我要走了
I'm leaving now.

462
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:36,065
计划照常  我们晚上九点半会面
Good, then we rendezvous at 2130 hours, as planned.

463
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:38,091
好
I'll be there.

464
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,083
抱歉  我这就过去
Excuse me, i'll be out of here

465
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,006
马上
In just one second.

466
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,083
我和你...
You and i...

467
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:03,011
我们得谈谈
...we're going to have a talk.

468
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:18,041
我们在旧行政办公楼设立了一个指挥所
We've got a command post set up at EEOB,

469
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,054
我们会向中情局和外交安全局汇报
And we'll brief cia and diplomatic security,

470
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:24,028
不过这得等我们执行完第一次地毯式搜捕后
But not until after the first sweep of arrests.

471
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:26,055
听着  没人跑得了
Look, nobody is going anywhere, phil.

472
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:27,099
我们已经在城内布下了天罗地网
We've dropped a net on the city.

473
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,069
有情况我会即时通知你
And i'll let you know as soon as that happens.

474
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,095
好
All right.

475
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,002
抱歉打扰
Yeah. i'm sorry to interrupt,

476
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:34,002
可你得听些东西
But i need you to listen to something.

477
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,006
-我可以吗  -没事
- May i? - Yeah, that's fine.

478
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:38,033
她应该是一流的系统分析员
She's supposed to be this whiz-bang systems analyst,

479
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,010
首先提醒我的是
Which is actually what tipped me off in the first place.

480
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:41,017
她的行为很怪异
Her demeanor is so bizarre...

481
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,050
詹尼斯
w-w-whoa, janis,

482
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:43,053
你在说谁
Who are you talking about?

483
00:20:43,054 --> 00:20:44,074
克罗伊·奥布赖恩
Chloe o'brian.

484
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,087
我检查了她的系统  结果发现
I ran a systems check on her work, and it turns out

485
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,031
有她篡改资料的证据
There's evidence of file tampering.

486
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:50,094
加上所有被她加密过的外线电话
Plus she's been scrambling all her out-of-office phone call

487
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:52,061
所以我注意了一下她的
So i had operations archive

488
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:53,088
往来通讯记录
Her cellular traffic.

489
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,071
我破解处理了一下
I did a work-around.

490
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:56,085
听
Listen.

491
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:58,008
喂
Yeah.

492
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,022
你找到伯内特了吗
Have you gotten to burnett yet?

493
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,022
正在找
Working on it.

494
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:01,045
我正前往白宫
Making my way over to the west wing.

495
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,069
我们这里有人已经发现
Someone here has figured out

496
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,080
数据库上已经删除了一个人名
That a name has been deleted from the database.

497
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:06,040
我不知道还能稳住她多久
I don't know how much longer i can hold her off.

498
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,056
他们知道是伯内特的名字吗
Do they know it was burnett?

499
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,049
不知道  但迟早会发现
No, but it's just a matter of time.

500
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,044
好  回头联系你
Okay, i'll get back to you.

501
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:16,061
贝克
Becker.

502
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:18,020
去会议室
In the conference room.

503
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:20,087
我要你扣留克罗伊·奥布赖恩
I want chloe o'brian detained.

504
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:23,011
-让她退出那个服务器  -遵命
And get her off that server. Yes.

505
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:26,070
奥布莱恩女士   请跟我走一趟
Mrs. O'Brian?  You need to come with me.

506
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,057
帮我接白宫
Get me the white house.

507
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:48,013
总统阁下  我只想提醒您
Let me just remind you, madam president,

508
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:49,060
您支持的行为
You supported the effort

509
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,037
是为了禁止虐待和拷问
To ban abuse and torture.

510
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,077
您参加竞选是为了改革情报部门
You campaigned to reform the intelligence agencies.

511
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,077
参议员  过去的这十小时
These past ten hours, senator,

512
00:21:56,078 --> 00:22:00,004
是非黑白没那么容易辨别
Things haven't appeared as black and white as they once did.

513
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:02,051
杰克·鲍尔没那么有神秘色彩
Well, there's nothing gray about jack bauer.

514
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:04,075
他对人施暴
The man has committed atrocities.

515
00:22:04,076 --> 00:22:07,055
在他的羁押下囚犯都死去了
Prisoners have died in his custody.

516
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:09,048
鲍尔先生得到过三任总统的信任和支持
Mr. bauer has served under the aegis

517
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,035
不止我一个人如此
Of three presidents, not just me.

518
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:14,019
如果这是被授予最高级别待遇的话
Is it any more lawful or any less repugnant

519
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,053
是否就更合法或不再那么令人讨厌了呢
If it's authorized at the highest level?

520
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:18,033
对于任何一任总统来说
A state of war is not a blank check

521
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:19,053
国家战争都得付出昂贵代价
For the president or for anyone.

522
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:21,051
别对我说教  参议员
Oh, don't lecture me, senator.

523
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:24,037
我很清楚自己权力有限
I am well aware of the limits of my power.

524
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:26,087
恕我直言  总统阁下
Due respect, madam president...

525
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:28,037
你权力很大
Your power is great.

526
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:30,017
还是谨慎些为好
Just be careful

527
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:32,008
确保自己利用它发出了正确的信号
That you use it to send the right message.

528
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:34,028
我只想让你
All i'm asking you to do

529
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:36,098
赦免杰克·鲍尔
Is excuse mr. bauer as a witness.

530
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:38,052
这不是个信号
It's not a message.

531
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:42,002
而是我对于他今天的贡献表示感激的方式
It is an expression of gratitude for what he's done today.

532
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:44,022
你让我赦免他
You're asking me to excuse him

533
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:47,059
让他不至于成为众矢之的调查对象
As a target of the investigation.

534
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,093
信号已经传达得很清楚了
And the message is clear.

535
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:51,086
有些情况下
Under certain circumstances,

536
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:53,040
您相信他的做法可行
You believe his methods are acceptable.

537
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:56,090
有些人也觉得可行
Some would argue that they are.

538
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:58,060
可他们错了
And they would be wrong.

539
00:22:58,061 --> 00:23:02,007
无论用何种军事或者道德标准
Under any military or moral standard.

540
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:05,031
美国走过冤枉路的  总统阁下
America has been down this road before, madam president.

541
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:07,091
你自己将其称之为国难
You yourself called it a national tragedy.

542
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:09,081
确实是国难
It was a tragedy.

543
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:11,068
我仍然坚信这点
I still believe that.

544
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:13,035
赦免杰克·鲍尔
Pardon jack bauer,

545
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:15,089
你就是在对这行的每个刑讯逼供的人说
And you're telling every interrogator in the field

546
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,010
大家放手虐囚吧  百无禁忌咯
That it's open season again.

547
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:22,053
抱歉打断您  总统阁下
I'm sorry to interrupt, madam president.

548
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:25,084
联调局的拉里·莫斯的急电
There's an urgent call from larry moss at fbi.

549
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:30,073
接进来
Put him through.

550
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:32,034
莫斯探员在线上
Agent moss is on the line.

551
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,037
莫斯探员
Agent moss,

552
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,054
我是伊森·卡宁
This is ethan kanin.

553
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:36,021
你正和总统连线
You're on speaker with the president.

554
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:37,024
总统阁下  请原谅我
Madam president, forgive me for

555
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:38,028
冒然来电
coming directly

556
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:39,099
您今晚要和迈尔参议员见面吗
You have a meeting this evening with senator mayer?

557
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,035
事实上  的确如此
In fact, i do.

558
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,038
我正和他在一起
I'm with him right now.

559
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,028
参议员的办公室主任  莱恩·伯内特
Did the senator's Chief of staff, ryan burnett, accompany

560
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,005
陪同参议员来白宫了吗
The senator to the white house?

561
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:49,053
来了  莫斯探员  怎么了
Yes, he did, agent moss-- why?

562
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,007
我有理由相信杰克·鲍尔
I have reason to believe that jack bauer

563
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:53,059
正在非法审讯伯内特先生
Is carrying out an off-book interrogation of mr. burnett

564
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,003
就在我们通话的当口
As we speak.

565
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,043
电池耗尽前
I can pull the trigger

566
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:04,050
我足以扣动128次扳机  甚至更多
128 more times before this battery dies.

567
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,060
告诉你
I'm telling you,

568
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:08,007
我对攻击一点都不知情
I don't know anything about an attack.

569
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:09,021
别对我撒谎
Stop lying to me.

570
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,098
-我没撒谎  -目标是哪里
- I'm not lying. - What's the target?

571
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,018
-我没法告诉你我不知道的事  -伯内特先生
- I can't tell you what i don't know. - Mr. burnett,

572
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,095
你是个叛国者  一个恐怖分子
You are a traitor and a terrorist.

573
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:15,098
我不是
I'm not.

574
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,086
我爱我的祖国
I love my country.

575
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:22,032
这是1200伏特的电流
That was 1,200 volts of current.

576
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:24,096
现在当我把这个盒子拿出来的时候
Now, when i eject this cartridge,

577
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:27,016
我会启动超频晕眩模式
I access the drive stun mode,

578
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:32,000
一旦启动  电压会猛增到40倍
Upping the voltage 40 times When directly administered.

579
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,013
你只要老实交代就成
All you need to do is talk to me.

580
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,053
伯内特先生  真的很简单
Mr. burnett, it's really simple.

581
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:36,097
只要告诉我  袭击目标是什么
Just tell me what the target is,

582
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:38,087
-这一切就结束了  -我向你保证
-And this will be all over. -i promise.

583
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:41,000
我真的不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

584
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,011
-这是你最后一次机会  -如果我知道
-This is your last chance. -if i knew,

585
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:45,038
我肯定会告诉你的  我发誓
I would tell you, i swear it.

586
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,084
你要我说什么呢
What do you want me to say?

587
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,079
你告诉我该怎么说  然后我重复一遍
Just... just tell me what to say, and i'll say it.

588
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:55,039
跟我玩鬼把戏  想都别想
Don't you even try and play that game with me.

589
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,012
伯内特先生  这行我干了很久了
Mr. burnett, i've been doing this a long time,

590
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,029
一个人在被胁迫的时候
And i can tell the difference,

591
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,066
他那到底有没有我要的情报
Especially when a man is under duress,

592
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,009
还是纯粹在浪费我的时间
If he's got information that i need

593
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,056
我能判断出来的
Or if i'm just wasting my time.

594
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:05,097
这次我向你保证  我没有浪费时间
And i promise you, i am not wasting my time.

595
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,090
下一轮
The next jolt

596
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,020
咱整整你的咽喉
Is gonna be in your throat.

597
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:12,087
你颈部以上所有的器官
Anything above your neck runs the risk

598
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:15,014
都会面临肌肉神经停滞的危险
Of a complete neuromuscular shutdown.

599
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:18,021
这就是说  你有可能瘫痪
That means you run the risk of becoming paralyzed.

600
00:25:18,022 --> 00:25:19,071
求你不要
No, please.

601
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:21,098
伯内特先生  你一手安排了整个听证会
Mr. burnett, you built the entire federal case

602
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:23,038
就是为了针对我
Against me.

603
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,038
你们都应该知道  为了阻止这次恐怖袭击
You of all people should know how far i am willing to go

604
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,005
我会不择手段
To stop this attack from happening.

605
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:30,059
我再问你最后一次
So, i'm gonna ask you one last time.

606
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,006
恐怖袭击的目标是什么
Where is the target?!

607
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,077
我
I...

608
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:36,099
我说  我说  我说
Okay, okay, okay.

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,023
我听着呢
I'm listening.

610
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:39,080
有士兵
Soldiers.

611
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,010
多少人
How many?

612
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:42,023
一个小队
A unit.

613
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:43,070
朱玛的总统卫队
Juma's presidential guard.

614
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:44,070
什么时候
When?

615
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:46,054
已经开始了
It already started.

616
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:47,054
目标是哪
Where?

617
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:48,064
是哪
Where?!

618
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,067
鲍尔先生
Mr. bauer,

619
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:52,011
我是总统泰勒
This is president taylor.

620
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:53,044
目标是哪
Where is the target?

621
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:54,071
-鲍尔先生  -目标是哪
Mr. bauer... where?!

622
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:58,028
鲍尔先生  我命令你接电话
Mr. bauer, i am ordering you to answer this page.

623
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:00,072
鲍尔先生  你听到没
Mr. bauer, do you hear me?

624
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:03,025
见鬼
Damn it!

625
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,036
总统阁下  我是杰克·鲍尔
Madam president, this is jack bauer.

626
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:06,096
我不知道你现在了解到多少情况了
I don't know what you've heard so far,

627
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,019
但是这件事情  还没完
But this thing is not over.

628
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,043
几分钟之内  还会有
There is another terrorist attack

629
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:10,099
新的恐怖袭击发生
Going to take place within minutes.

630
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,076
不给我开门  就不谈这些
There will be no discussion until you unlock this door.

631
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:15,040
总统阁下  袭击已经开始了
Madam president, the attack window is open.

632
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,073
朱玛的人已经行动了
Juma's men are moving.

633
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,040
鲍尔先生  你这样做是违法的
What you're doing is against the law, mr. bauer.

634
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,094
我是总司令官  我命令你
I am your commander in chief, and i am ordering you

635
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:23,062
停止行动
To stand down.

636
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:29,075
还要多长时间  警卫
How much longer, sergeant?

637
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:31,065
-已经可以了  阁下  -动手
-Good to go, ma'am. -do it.

638
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,075
目标在哪
Where's the target?

639
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:34,058
目标在哪
Where is the target?!

640
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,030
目标...
Where is...?!

641
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,020
我逼他说了
I had him!

642
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:47,026
有人受伤
Man down.

643
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:50,004
急诊队快来贵宾接待室
Emts to the visiting dignitary suite.

644
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:55,004
你完了  鲍尔
You're done, bauer.

645
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:56,052
你没戏了
You're finished.

646
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,074
他就要招了
He was talking.

647
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,048
不论发生什么  现在已经在发生了
Whatever's going to happen is happening now,

648
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:02,031
你等着遭良心谴责吧
And it's on your conscience.

649
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:05,042
我的良心比起你的来  问题少得多
My conscience has a lot less to answer for than yours.

650
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:15,069
鲍尔先生  你说有袭击会发生
Mr. bauer, you say an attack is imminent.

651
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,045
我的情报来源很可靠
My source intel is good.

652
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:19,004
谁是你的情报来源
Who is your source?

653
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,036
这个我不想说
I'd rather not say.

654
00:27:21,037 --> 00:27:23,011
名字  鲍尔先生
The name, mr. bauer.

655
00:27:27,015 --> 00:27:28,054
托尼·阿尔梅达
Tony almeida.

656
00:27:28,055 --> 00:27:30,071
托尼·阿尔梅达  他是个逃犯
Tony almeida-- the man's a fugitive.

657
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:32,038
没有他  我们是不会
Without tony almeida, we would never

658
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,054
重获CIP装置的
Have recovered the cip device.

659
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,068
总统阁下
Madam president,

660
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,025
我不管  就算他的情报来源
I don't care if his source

661
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:37,081
是圣母玛利亚
Is the blessed virgin mary.

662
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:39,075
也不能为他刚在这房间里的所作所为开脱
Nothing justifies what went on in this room.

663
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,055
即使他是正确的吗  布莱恩
Even if he's right, blaine?

664
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:44,072
即使这样做能拯救很多生命吗
Even if it means we could save lives?

665
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:48,039
看看吧  这不就是野蛮吗
Look at that, and tell me it's not barbarism.

666
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,016
你能眼睁睁看着这些事情发生吗
Is that something you can live with?

667
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,043
今天早些时候  总统阁下
Earlier today, madam president,

668
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,046
两架飞机相撞
Two airplanes were brought down.

669
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,050
你能眼睁睁看着这些事情发生吗
Is that something you can live with?

670
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:58,056
你是应受谴责  鲍尔
You're reprehensible, bauer.

671
00:27:58,057 --> 00:27:59,090
而长官你太软弱
and you, sir, are weak!

672
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:01,051
对邪恶的事情
Unwilling and unable

673
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:04,041
不想也无力去跟他们针锋相对
To look evil in the eye and deal with it.

674
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:07,012
伊桑  借一步说话
Ethan, step out for a second.

675
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:17,005
突然之间  这就不算假设了  对不对
Suddenly, it's not so hypothetical, is it?

676
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:18,056
在你看来
In your opinion,

677
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:20,059
鲍尔的情报  可信吗
Is bauer's intelligence actionable?

678
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,046
如果鲍尔说会有恐怖袭击
If bauer says there's going to be an attack,

679
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:25,024
我是相信的
My belief is, there's going to be an attack.

680
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:32,064
拷打最初被认为是刑讯逼供的手段
Torture was originally intended to force false confessions.

681
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:36,024
现在我们却用它来寻求真相
Now we use it to try and find the truth.

682
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,061
这些人谋害了您的儿子  总统阁下
These people murdered your son, madam president.

683
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:41,008
又差点谋杀了您的丈夫
They attempted to murder your husband.

684
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:43,059
他们已经肆无忌惮
They will stop at nothing.

685
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:58,050
警卫  把鲍尔先生带走
Sergeant, take mr. bauer away.

686
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:00,001
他被捕了
He's under arrest.

687
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,014
你应该先来找我的
You should have come to me.

688
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:08,000
你应该报案的
You should have presented your case.

689
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:09,061
没时间的
We didn't have time.

690
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:13,052
就算报告给您  又有什么不同呢  阁下
And would it really have made a difference, ma'am?

691
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:23,065
总统阁下
Madam president...

692
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,089
你做的是对的
You're doing the right thing.

693
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,066
已经死了271个人了
271 dead already.

694
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:29,066
我向上帝祈祷  我做的是对的
I wish to god it felt more like the right thing.

695
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,016
伊桑  提高恐怖袭击的预警等级
Ethan, raise the threat levels.

696
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:33,036
通告国土安全局
Tell homeland that they have

697
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,037
他们得马上制定一个应急方案
To come up with a response scenario.

698
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:36,073
还有  把蒂姆叫过来
And get tim down here.

699
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,065
并且  我要跟伯内特亲自谈一下
Also, i want to talk to mr. burnett myself.

700
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,011
我去跟他谈吧
Let me do that.

701
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:44,037
我了解他
I know the man.

702
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:47,045
很显然  你并不了解
Apparently, you don't.

703
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,073
蒂姆  我知道恐怖袭击预警已经提高
Tim, i understand the threat level

704
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:11,069
但是只针对些快速反应机构和联邦机构
Has been raised, but only for first responders and federal agents.

705
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,009
有件事需要关注  恐怖袭击发生的时候
There's a concern that mass evacuation

706
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,039
大规模的疏散群众
By the public could hamper efforts

707
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,083
可能会影响我们拖延恐怖袭击的效率
To thwart an attack when it comes.

708
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:17,063
华盛顿的空域怎么样
What about the airspace over washington?

709
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:18,063
已经限飞
Restricted.

710
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:20,037
已经开始着手组织军机低空巡逻
Military flyovers are commencing.

711
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:23,080
国防部建议我们部署机动部队
DOD has recommended that we deploy mobile teams to sweep the area

712
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,031
彻底搜查附近的放射性和生物性物质
For radioactive and biological signatures.

713
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,035
我马上打电话给五角大楼的菲利浦
I'll call phillip at the pentagon

714
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:28,014
让他赶快行动
and push it through.

715
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:29,034
国安局那边呢
What about nsa?

716
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,075
监控到有关的反美的声音
There's elevated anti-american chatter

717
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:34,021
只是在一些平常的网站跟电话中
Coming from the usual web sites and telephone traffic,

718
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,082
但没有特指到这次袭击
But nothing specific to the attack.

719
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,082
谢谢你  蒂姆
Thank you, tim.

720
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:39,052
-15分钟后楼上见  -好的  阁下
- I'll see you upstairs in 15 minutes. -yes, ma'am.

721
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,042
这就意味着  我们最好的情报来源
Which means our best source of intelligence

722
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:43,066
还在我们的眼皮子底下
Is still right here under our noses.

723
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:46,039
你想到过我们得放这个混蛋一马吧
You realize we're gonna have to offer this bastard a free pass.

724
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,039
招降工作还得秘密进行
With coercive measures off the table,

725
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,096
这是我们唯一的选择了
It's our only option.

726
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:53,053
鲍尔锒铛入狱  而叛徒却逍遥法外
Bauer's going to prison, and a traitor walks.

727
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:56,028
这世界到底是怎么了
What's wrong with this picture?

728
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:00,072
我要和犯人单独呆会
I need a minute with the prisoner.

729
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,084
伯内特先生
Mr. burnett,

730
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:07,075
你将被联邦法律18章2381节

731
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:10,032
以叛国罪论处
Section 2381, of the united states code.

732
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,032
罪名是资敌
Giving aid and comfort to the enemy

733
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:15,032
和导致美国公民的死亡
And directly causing the death of american citizens.

734
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,030
你明白吗
Do you understand?

735
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,043
当然  你肯定要为自己辩解
Surely, you have something to say for yourself.

736
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:24,073
我要求见律师
I demand my right to counsel.

737
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:28,033
这没问题  伯内特先生
You'll have your counsel, mr. burnett,

738
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:31,054
但首先你得坦白一切
But first, you're going to tell me everything you know.

739
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,064
死都不会
Not in this lifetime.

740
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:35,054
-你刚说什么  -我说
-What did you say?  -i said,

741
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:37,018
死都不会
Not in this lifetime.

742
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:41,032
伯内特先生  别这么快就下定决心
Don't be so quick to make up your mind, mr. burnett.

743
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:47,045
为了阻止或减轻袭击的伤害
In exchange for information which stops

744
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:49,099
作为交换条件
Or significantly mitigates this attack,

745
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,060
总统可以特赦你的一切罪行
The president is prepared to grant you full immunity from prosecution.

746
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,060
对不起
I'm sorry.

747
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:58,003
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

748
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:01,001
如果你和你的家人被挟持了
If you and your family are being threatened in any way...

749
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:06,045
你明白总统给你提供了什么样的条件吗
Do you realize what the president is offering you?

750
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:11,014
叛国罪是死罪  伯内特先生
Treason is a capital offense, mr. burnett.

751
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:13,091
如果你现在不合作
If you don't cooperate with us right now,

752
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:15,038
我会亲自过问此事
I will make it my personal mission

753
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,042
让你为你的罪行付出最终的代价
To see that you pay the ultimate price for your crimes.

754
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:21,039
我不赞同刑讯逼供  但就你的情况而言
I won't condone torture, but in your case,

755
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,017
我不会介意你被判处死刑
I would have no problem with the death penalty.

756
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,080
我律师在哪
Where's my lawyer?

757
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:24,035
-沃克  -是我

医院那事如何了

00:34:19,072 --> 00:34:22,088
为了给我们开辟安全通道离开这个国家
Because he got delayed in his attempt to secure safe passage for us

786
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:24,011

787
00:34:24,012 --> 00:34:26,011

Then, sir,

我们还要10分钟
We're ten minutes away.

800
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:04,068
有没有可能是朱玛本人亲自率队
Is it possible that juma himself is leading this attack?

801
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,051
朱玛  为什么这么说
Juma? why do you say that?

802
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:09,018
我知道这不可思议  但我见到他了
I know it sounds crazy, but i swear that i just saw him.

知道他们下个目标是什么吗
Any idea what the next target is?

808
00:35:17,076 --> 00:35:18,092
不知道
Negative.

809
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:20,033
看看能否找出来  但听我说
See if you get a fix on that. but, listen,

810
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:21,096
别冒险
Don't take any chances.

811
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:23,000
好吗
All right?

812
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,096
知道
I won't.

813
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:29,072
长官

托尼  我是比尔

比尔  杰克被捕了

819
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:50,031
他们把他关起来了

820
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:51,097
-听我说  比尔  -你听我说

821
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:54,041
我们还不知道袭击在哪发生
We still don't know where this attack's taking place.

822
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,084
伯内特没招供吗?
Burnett didn't break?

823
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:58,078
没  杰克被他们阻止了
No. they stopped jack before he could get the information.

824
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:01,002
伯内特不接受总统的特赦
And burnett didn't go for the president's immunity deal.

825
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:04,012
是你给杰克情报的  是吗
You were the one who brought jack the intel, right?

826
00:38:04,012 --> 00:38:05,055
是的
That's right.

827
00:38:05,055 --> 00:38:06,072
情报可靠吗
How real is it?

828
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:07,079
当然
Very.

829
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,066
谁是你的线人
Who was your contact?

830
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:12,033
一个和朱玛有直接联系的爱默生的手下
It was a guy in emerson's crew with a direct line to juma.

831
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:14,013
能搞定他吗
Any chance we get another crack at this guy?

832
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:15,016
不太可能
That's highly unlikely,

833
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:16,050
至少可以这么说
To say the least.

834
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,080
难道他死了吗
What are you telling me, he's dead?

835
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,084
对的
That's right?

836
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:23,067
我真希望你让我也加入
I wish to god you'd brought me in on this.

837
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,067
杰克不想牵连你
Jack didn't want to put you in that position.

838
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:26,084
事实上
For what it's worth,

839
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,021
他是想保护你  比尔
He was trying to protect you, bill.

840
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,045
至少  你总该有个备用计划吧
Did you have a fallback plan, at least?

841
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:32,085
伯内特同意赦免提议就是备用计划
Immunity for burnett was the fallback.

842
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:34,088
就这个啊  没别的路可走了吗
That's it? nothing else?

843
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:36,089
没
No.

844
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:39,022
没了
Nothing.

845
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,006
我试图联系蕾妮  但只能接通留言信箱
I keep trying renee, and i keep getting her voice mail.

846
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:45,029
出什么事了
What the hell's going on?

847
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:46,049
她手机有问题
There's something wrong with her phone.

848
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:47,060
手机出问题是什么意思
What do you mean, something's wrong?

849
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,080
5分钟前我刚和她通话
I just spoke to her five minutes ago.

850
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,020
能找出她的位置吗
Can you triangulate her position?

851
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,013
-找不出  -为什么
-I can't.  -why not?

852
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,044
没信号了
There's no signal.

853
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:55,047
要么是电池没电了
Either the battery's dead,

854
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:57,017
要么是手机坏掉了
Or her cell got damaged somehow.

855
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:59,021
好的  继续试
All right, keep trying.

856
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:01,061
-有消息就通知我  -好的
-Get back to me when you know something.  -okay.

857
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:40,052
从我们的位置
From our location

858
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:42,085
到入口大概100米
It is approximately 100 meters to the entrance.

865
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,084
愿上帝与我们同在

866
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,090
劳伦特  在船上待命
