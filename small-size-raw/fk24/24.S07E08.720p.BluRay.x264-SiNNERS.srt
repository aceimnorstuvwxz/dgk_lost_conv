我以为你已经干掉阿尔梅达和杰克了

20
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:38,031
该死  他们怎么找到这的

You and Bill do a sweep. See if you can find Dubaku.

31
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:07,027
我们无法在百万人口的城市中
We are not equipped to look for one man

32
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:08,034
找一个人
in a city of millions.

33
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,021
我们需要其它的资源

34
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:11,071
政府吗  他们不可信

35
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,088
我们不能信任任何人
We can't trust anybody.

36
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:14,021
这就是为什么我们独自行动
That's why we're working on the outside.

37
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:17,036
可以相信泰勒总统

38
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,038
总统阁下  请您听我讲

43
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,019
我会当面向您禀告的

我一直在努力联系盖奇探员
I've been trying to reach agent Gedge,

48
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:41,057
他还是没接电话
And he hasn't picked up.

49
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:44,024
他说他在萨曼莎·罗斯的公寓外

50
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:46,054
等候第一先生

51
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:49,066
你是说我丈夫失踪了吗
You're telling me my husband's gone missing?

52
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:53,022
盖奇死了
Gedge is dead.

53
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:54,039
出什么事了
What happened?

54
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,072
出了问题  泰勒杀了盖奇
Something went wrong. Taylor killed Gedge,

55
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,005
我不知道他怎么做到的
I don't know how.

56
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,039
别杀他
Don't kill him.

57
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,023
把他带到我这
Bring him to me.

00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:06,053
以下事件发生在下午3点到4点之间
The following take place between 3:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M.

59
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,044
你确定没被跟踪
You're certain you weren't followed?

60

是的  快  帮我把他弄进去

the tragedies that unfolded in the skies over Washington

63
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:41,030
汲沦谷镇的悲剧系恐怖分子所为
and in Kidron, Ohio, were indeed acts of terrorism.

64
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:45,040
但是我向大家保证
But I am here to assure you that those responsible

65
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,047
当前的危机已经过去

66
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:51,028
他们妄图阻止我们拯救桑加拉的
Their attempts to stop us from intervening

67
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:54,008
阴谋已经破产

我们不会向恐怖分子屈服

69
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:01,042
我刚刚下令让军队

70

开始执行拯救

桑加拉的军事行动

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,056

74
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:17,001
乌勒·马托波的领导下重获民主

75
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:50,084
你  你  过来

我4点钟要换班
I've got a shift that starts at 4:00.

00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:07,096
去吧  钱会汇到你指定的账户
Then go. Your money will be wired to the usual account.

00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:14,019
房间是隔音的  泰勒先生
The room is soundproof, Mr. Taylor.

81
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,043
放弃徒劳的叫喊和求救吧
There's no point in screaming or trying to call for help.

82
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:21,071
埃利姆  拿掉泰勒先生的封口布
Elimu, remove Mr. Taylor's gag.

83
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:25,070
你个狗娘养的
you son of a bitch.

84
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:28,031
你杀了我儿子
You're behind my son's death.

85
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:30,091
是他多管闲事自找的
He was poking his nose where it did not belong.

86
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,074
你不会得逞的  清醒点吧
You'll never get away with this. You must know that.

87
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:34,048
全城的人都在找我
Everyone in the city is going be looking for me.

88
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:38,062
你只需要回答一个问题  泰勒先生
You should be concerned with just one question, Mr. Taylor.

89
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:42,022
你妻子对你的爱
Does your wife love you enough

90
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:45,059
足够让她撤销针对我国的入侵令吗
to call off the invasion of my country?

91
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,073
为了你的性命着想

100
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:21,046
并为我们在前线上

00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:24,053
为自由而战的勇士们祈福

118
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,007

129
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:39,024
对于您在我国遭绑架并受辱之事
That you were subjected to such an ordeal

130
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:42,001
真的让我和我的国家
on our soil is a source of shame both to me

131
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,097
都深感愧疚
personally and to my country.

132
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:45,018
总统阁下
Madame president,

133
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,078
我更关心的是桑加拉  不是自己
My chief concern is for Sangala, not myself.

134
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,071
我能问一下您
May I ask what your timetable is

135
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:51,018
何时出兵吗
for the invasion?

136
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:55,002
我已经下令让部队进攻
I've issued the order To our military to proceed.

真的是太感谢您了

您为我的国民所做的

139
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,006
和这些人为您国家所做的一样伟大
Much as these people have done for your country.

140
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:04,076
打断一下  总理先生
Now forgive me, prime minister,

141
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:07,013
我对这个结果百思不得其解
But I'm finding that hard to believe.

142
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:09,063
我向您保证  事实不像您想的那样
I assure you, none of this is as it seems.

143
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:11,064
但他们会解释一切的
But they're here to explain themselves.

144
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:14,064
现在  请容许我
Now, if you'll excuse me, madame president,

145
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,004
和我的人商议一下
I must meet with my people

146
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,041
战后的重建计划
to discuss post-invasion plans.

147
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,049
当然可以
Of course.

148
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:32,066
现在马上就给我解释这一切
I want an explanation and I want it now.

149
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,066
到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?!

150
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,079
总统阁下
Madame president,

151
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,020
6周前  比尔·布坎南发现
Six weeks ago, Bill Buchanan discovered

152
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:39,063
您政府内的一个重要成员
that key members of your government

153
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:40,097
正在同朱玛将军
were working with general Juma

154
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:42,087
和杜巴库上校合作并试图
and colonel Dubaku in an effort

155
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:44,050
破坏我国的外交政策
to undermine this nation's foreign policy--

156
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:48,044
就是您针对桑加拉的出兵计划
Your foreign policy with regards to Sangala.

157
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:52,044
你们意识到这是一个无端的指控
You realize that that is an outrageous accusation?

158
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:55,091
是的  阁下
Yes, ma'am.

159
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:57,031
不幸的是  这是事实
Unfortunately, it's the truth.

160
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:59,018
这就是在这次危机中您针对
It explains why during this crisis,

161
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,089
杜巴库所做的一切努力都失败的原因
Every effort you made to stop Dubaku failed.

162
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,052
比尔  为什么你不告诉我
Bill, why didn't you come to me?

163
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:09,026
我不知道该相信谁也不知道您能否相信我
I didn't know who I could trust or if you'd even believe me.

164
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:11,046
所以我安插了
So I formed

165
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:14,070
一个小组来找出杜巴库
a small group to locate and neutralize Dubaku.

166
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,097
最终托尼·阿尔梅达和杰克
Tony Almeida and ultimately, Jack,

167
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:17,013
加入了我们
Joined me.

168
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:19,024
起先就是托尼·阿尔梅达
Tony Almeida was the one who put the CIP device

169
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,044
把CIP装置
into Dubaku's hands

170
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,071
卖给杜巴库的
in the first place.

171
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:25,011
利用CIP装置做诱饵  对卧底工作
Using the CIP device as bait was necessary

172
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:26,088
是很必要的
to the undercover operation.

173
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,061
我们能利用它引出杜巴库
We had to follow it back to Dubaku.

174
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:29,061
那么多的人
A lot of people

175
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:32,085
死于空难  更别说汲沦谷的
died on those planes, never mind what

176
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:35,065
化工厂还有发生泄露的危险
could have happened at the chemical plant in Kidron!

177
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,089
总统阁下  打断一下
Madame president, if I may, I was part

178
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,062
我参与了联调局追回CIP装置的行动
of the FBI task force assigned to recover the CIP device,

179
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:42,073
我以个人名义担保他们所说的话
and I can personally vouch for what they're telling you.

180
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:44,070
的确  很多人牺牲了
The loss of life was tragic, yes,

181
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:46,016
但是在我看来
but in my opinion,everything

182
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:48,091
这些人所做的  却拯救了成千上万的人
these men have done saved the lives of thousands.

183
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:54,081
假设你们所说的是事实
If I choose to believe everything you're telling me,

184
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:57,027
你们下一步打算怎么办
where would you go from here?

185
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:58,048
杜巴库是唯一知道
Dubaku is the only person

186
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:00,014
在政府里面
with the names of the people who betrayed you

187
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:01,021
都有谁背叛了您
within your government.

188
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:02,045
我们必须找到他
It's imperative that we find him.

189
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:04,068
我们必须暗中调查
We would have to work under the radar.

190
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:06,015
一旦声张出去
Any word of an investigation,

191
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:07,045
他们就会躲藏起来
people would start running for cover.

192
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,039
你是说  联邦调查局和国土安全局
You're saying we can't even involve

193
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,032
也不能包括在内
The FBI and homeland?

194
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,080
是的  长官
Yes, sir, That's correct.

195
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,053
总统阁下
Madame president,

196
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,086
蒂姆·伍兹找您
Tim Woods is on the phone.

197
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,096
他说情况紧急
He says it's urgent.

198
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,013
接过来
Put him through.

199
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:20,060
接过来
Put him through.

200
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,037
请坐吧
Have a seat.

201
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:25,030
喂
Yes?

202
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,087
总统阁下  抱歉打扰
Madame president, I'm sorry to interrupt.

203
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:29,007
埃克·杜巴库打电话来了
There's a call for you from Ike Dubaku.

204
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:31,047
声音对比确定是他  他说是关于您丈夫的
Voice I.D. confirms that. He says it's about your husband.

205
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,084
我丈夫
My husband?

206
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:37,029
是的  阁下  我为您接通
Yes, ma'am. I'll connect you.

207
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:41,085
我是泰勒总统
This is president Taylor.

208
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:44,015
开门见山吧  总统阁下
I'll come straight to the point, madame president.

209
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,069
你丈夫在我手里
I have your husband.

210
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,003
给你证明下
Let me demonstrate.

211
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,087
打个招呼
Say something.

212
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,006
艾莉森
Allison...

213
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,093
亨利  你没事吧
Henry, are you all right?

214
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,040
我没事
I'm fine.

215
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,004
对不起
I'm sorry about this.

216
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:00,057
看在上帝的份上  别让他们利用我
For god sake, don't let them use me

217
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,058
来影响你做任何决定
to influence you in any way.

218
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:05,058
我的要求如下
My demands as follows

219
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:07,031
立即下令让你的军队
You will have your forces

220
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:09,058
从我的国家桑加拉
withdrawn from around my country, Sangala,

221
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:11,015
永久撤军
immediately and permanently.

222
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:15,002
另外  把马托波交给我的人
Also, Motobo must be delivered to my men

223
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:16,099
他们会在斯坦威克
who will be stationed at the east lot

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,082
发电厂的东侧空地等着
of the stanswick power plant.

225
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,069
四点之前  不把他交出来
If he's not there by 4:00,

226
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,029
或者想跟踪或阻止我的人
or if anybody attempts to follow or impede my men

227
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,080
离开发电厂
when they leave the plant,

228
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,053
你丈夫会被慢慢折磨致死
your husband will die a slow and certain death.

229
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:31,014
你敢
You wouldn't dare!

230
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,084
切掉他的手指
Cut off his finger.

231
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:56,030
住手
Stop it!

232
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:59,000
住手
Stop it!

233
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,077
满足我的要求
Meet my demands

234
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:06,070
不然  我会把他切成块儿  给你送回去
or I will send him back to you one piece at a time.

235
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:10,084
明白了么  总统阁下
Do you understand, madame president?

236
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:13,021
好的 我明白了
Yes, I understand.

237
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:15,061
任何想找到你丈夫的尝试
Any attempt to find your husband

238
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,031
我都会很快知道的
will be known to me very quickly,

239
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:20,029
然后我会马上杀了他
And I will kill him immediately.

240
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:25,049
总统阁下  我刚得知
Madame president, I just heard back

241
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,009
派出去的人员  在亨利最后一个落脚点
from the team I sent to Henry's last-known location.

242
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,043
发现了萨曼莎·罗斯
They found Samantha Roth's

243
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:31,070
和盖奇探员的尸体
and secret service agent Gedge's bodies.

244
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:32,086
天哪
Oh, god!

245
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:35,003
盖奇持有令人瘫痪的药物
Gedge had possession of a paralytic drug.

246
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,077
证据表明  盖奇与人合谋
That and other evidence on scene suggests he was complicit

247
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,037
绑架了亨利  当然  这也证明了
in Henry's abduction, which, of course, confirms

248
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:43,034
你们刚刚提到的腐败问题
the corruption you just told us about.

249
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,021
总统阁下  时间紧迫
Madame president, time is tight.

250
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:49,068
我们得马上做出反应
We need to decide how to respond.

251
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,075
没人会指责您
I don't think anyone would blame you

252
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:55,029
停止  哪怕是暂时的
for holding back, at least temporarily,

253
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,063
对桑加拉的进攻
the invasion of Sangala.

254
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:01,037
空难总共死了多少人
How many people died on those planes?

255
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:03,086
多少
How many?!

256
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,053
大概三百人  阁下
About 300, ma'am.

257
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:10,061
都是因为我坚持进兵桑加拉
All because I refused to change course in Sangala.

258
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:22,058
怎么可以只叫美国人民做出牺牲
How can I ask the American people to make sacrifices

259
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:26,006
而我却例外呢
That I'm not willing to make myself?

260
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,056
我不能屈服
I can't give in.

261
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:36,023
绝不
I can't.

262
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:39,016
总统阁下
Madame president...

263
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:41,016
四点之前我们还是
We can still try and find your husband

264
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:42,067
有希望救出您丈夫的
before the 4:00 deadline.

265
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:45,097
杜巴库明令禁止这么做
Dubaku has specifically forbidden that.

266
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,067
而且根据你的说法
And according to you, I can't trust any of my

267
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,084
我无法相信任何执法机构
law enforcement agencies.

268
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:51,042
您可以相信我
You can trust me.

269
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:54,091
现在所有人都认为沃克探员已经死了
Right now everyone believes that agent Walker is dead,

270
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:56,078
我也没有任何身份
And I have no status at all.

271
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,018
这就意味着  杜巴库的内线
Which means that Dubaku's spies

272
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,079
无法追踪我们  就官方的说法  我们并不存在
cannot track us because officially, we don't exist.

273
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,072
你已经辞去了公职
You resigned from government service,

274
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:07,097
参议院也把你定性为叛国者
And the senate regards you as having been a renegade agent.

275
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:14,010
这叫我如何相信你呢
How am I supposed to know where your loyalties really lie?

276
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:19,014
总统阁下  您可以打听我的为人
With all due respect, madame president, ask around.

277
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:28,005
这么短的时间  你们又能做什么呢
What could you even do on such short notice?

278
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,095
我不敢承诺什么
I couldn't make you any promises,

279
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:32,088
但是我会全力以赴救出您丈夫
But we will do everything possible to save your husband.

280
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,072
现在我们需要您假装
Right now, we need you to go along

281
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:39,000
屈服于杜巴库的要求  帮我们争取时间
with Dubaku's demands. Help buy us some time.

282
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,034
总统阁下  您没有别的选择了
Madame president, you don't have another choice.

283
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,081
好吧
All right.

284
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:52,080
好吧
All right.

285
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,024
拜托你找到他
Find him, please?

286
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,008
好的  阁下
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,055
我们需要条绝密线路
We're gonna need a secure hard line.

288
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,083
如果需要  你们可以用这间屋
You may use this room if you need to.

289
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:18,046
准备好时  我会派人
I'll have you escorted back out through

290
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,093
护送你们从地下出口出去
The underground entrance when you're ready.

291
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:21,056
我需要一份总统和第一先生的
I'm gonna need a copy of the president

292
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:23,000
特勤人员的详细资料
and the first gentleman's secret service details.

293
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,033
我让他们给你拿一份
I'll have them brought to you.

294
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:25,084
谢谢
Thank you.

295
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:28,034
我们从盖奇探员开始
Okay, we'll start off with agent Gedge.

296
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,004
我们得查他的通话记录
We need access to his phone records.

297
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:32,028
我要知道  过去几小时他跟谁通过话
I want to know who he's been talking to over the last few hours.

298
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,024
很明显  这事我们无法
Obviously, we can't use any of

299
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:36,002
通过总统的安保人员得知
The president's security people.

300
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:39,053
谢谢
Thank you.

301
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,029
通话记录是高级机密
Phone logs are highly classified,

302
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,036
尤其是保护总统家庭的探员的
Especially for agents assigned to the first family.

303
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,086
克罗伊能破解进去么
Can Chloe o'brian get access?

304
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,092
找一个有权查看的
It'll be faster if we can get someone

305
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,093
会更快一些
Who's already got clearance.

306
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:49,099
拉里·莫斯
Larry Moss.

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,079
他可不像能在
He doesn't strike me

308
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
背地里干活的人
as someone who's willing to work outside the system.

309
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:56,080
的确  但是我能说服他帮我们
That's true, but I think I can persuade him to do what we need.

310
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:58,004
你真的相信他
You really trust him?

311
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,030
是的  我们彼此很了解
Yes. we know each other pretty well.

312
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:05,065
好  试试吧  我们时间不多了
Fine. Try him. We don't have much time.

313
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,085
我是莫斯探员
Agent Moss.

314
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:19,039
拉里  我是蕾妮  我还活着
Larry, it's Renee. I'm alive,

315
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,089
不要告诉任何人  明白么
But you can't let anyone know. Do you understand me?

316
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,057
天哪
Oh, my god.

317
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:32,070
蕾妮  你在哪呢  你没事吧
Renee? What... where are you? are you all right?

318
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:34,054
我没事  待会再跟你解释
I'm-I'm fine. I'll explain later,

319
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:36,044
现在我们需要你的帮助
But right now we need your help.

320
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,064
我们  还有谁
Who's, who's "we"?

321
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:39,031
我和杰克·鲍尔
Myself and Jack Bauer.

322
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:40,068
什么
What?!

323
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:43,055
他站在我们这边  拉里  像他说的
He's on our side, Larry, just like he said.

324
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,082
他做的一切只是不想暴露自己
Everything that he did, he did to preserve his cover.

325
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,019
蕾妮  这么长时间  我都在担心你的生死
Renee, this whole time I've been thinking you were dead.

326
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,052
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

327
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:50,085
拉里  如他所言
The bureau is compromised.

328
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:53,039
调查局有内鬼  这是一次
Larry, just like he said, and no one there can know

329
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,047
机密行动  而且不能留下记录
about this operation. It has to stay completely off book.

330
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,066
什么行动
What operation?

331
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:03,077
我和杰克在白宫
Jack and I are at the white house.

332
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:06,077
第一先生被杜巴库绑架了
The first gentleman has been kidnapped by ike Dubaku.

333
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,027
我...  我完全不知情
I don't, I don't know anything about that.

334
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:12,001
真的  总统命令我和杰克找到他
It's true. The president's asked Jack and me to find him.

335
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,041
只有几人知晓此事
Very few people know about this,

336
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,045
我们必须守口如瓶  掩人耳目
and that's the way that it has to stay.

337
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:18,049
要是我们4点还找不到他  他就会被杀
If we don't find him by 4:00 p.m., he'll be killed.

338
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:24,039
拉里  如果你曾相信过我
Larry... if you've ever trusted me,

339
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,009
现在也请相信我吧  帮帮我
trust me now, please, and help me.

340
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,039
要我怎么帮
What do you want me to do?

341
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,036
好像第一先生的特勤局保镖
Looks like the first gentleman's secret service agent

342
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:34,073
与此事有关  他叫布莱恩·盖奇  他死了
was involved in all of this-- Brian Gedge; he's dead.

343
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:36,023
查查他的电话记录
You need to check his phone logs

344
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:37,090
并尽可能拿到他的
and get all the information you can

345
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:40,091
近期所有的通话记录
about who he's been in contact with recently.

346
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:46,068
我得见你  确定这一切是真的
I need to see you to make sure this is real,

347
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:47,094
不是你在受到胁迫下说出来的
that you're not under duress.

348
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:50,011
没有那么做的时间了
No, there's no time for that.

349
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:51,081
没得商量  要我帮忙  就和我见面
That's not negotiable. You want my help, we meet.

350
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:54,042
在静思池见  尽快赶到
The capitol reflecting pool, as soon as you can get there.

351
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,083
好吧
Okay, fine.

352
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,000
我想他会帮我们  但我们得过去
He'll help us, I think, but we need to go.

353
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:16,054
泰勒总统强调
President Taylor emphasized

354
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:18,091
恐怖分子不再是威胁
the terrorists are no longer a threat

355
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:21,015
并将开始进军
and says the invasion will begin.

356
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:22,042
她还说
She also says

357
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,099
前总理乌勒·马托波会重新上台
former prime minister Ule Motobo will be reinstated

358
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,009
并建立一个新的民主政府
to work towards building a new democratic government.

359
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,009
我不明白
I don't get it.

360
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,012
怎么
What?

361
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,052
总统这么说  好像
The president's talking as if

362
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:33,003
已经找到CIP装置和马托波了似的
the CIP device and Motobo have been recovered,

363
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:35,033
但如果这是真的  我们怎么不知道
but how could that have happened without us knowing about it?

364
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:37,026
那只能说明别的局把这事儿办了
Well, it just means whatever agency's responsible

365
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:38,027
没告诉我们
hasn't let us know.

366
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:39,027
还有别的局吗
What other agency?

367
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:40,030
我们都被蒙在鼓里了
We're being kept out of the loop,

368
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:41,071
我不喜欢这样
and I don't like it.

369
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:45,097
今晚我们有"节目"吗
So am I seeing you later?

370
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:49,014
不知道  我还有事要处理
I don't know. I've got some things to figure out.

371
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:50,031
你什么意思
What does that mean?

372
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:52,005
我是说我得回家一趟
It means I have to get home at some point.

373
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,078
我都一周没见克里斯蒂娜了
I haven't seen Christina in a week.

374
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,045
好吧
All right.

375
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:59,012
西恩  你还好吧
Sean, are you all right?

376
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,046
我还好
I'm fine.

377
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,032
我觉得你在疏远我
I'm sensing a little distance.

378
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,040
我得继续干活了
I just have to get back to work.

379
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:13,083
打扰一下
Excuse me.

380
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:16,084
拜托别做得这么露骨  行吗
Could you be a little less obvious, do you think?

381
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,011
你指什么
What are you talking about?

382
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,017
得了吧
Give me a break.

383
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,077
你干脆举个牌子  写上
Just hold up a sign that says,

384
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:22,064
嘿  同志们  我们有一腿
"hey, world, we're sleeping together."

385
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:23,081
你是傻子吗
Are you stupid?

386
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:26,028
我知道这是个愚蠢的错误
I know it's stupid and wrong,

387
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:27,078
我会了断这一切
and I'm gonna end it.

388
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,032
对  最好快一点  别让拉里觉察
Yeah, you'd better, fast, before Larry notices.

389
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,079
拉里人呢
Where is Larry?

390
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,075
我不知道  这不重要
I don't know. That's not the point.

391
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:35,079
重要的是  要是他发现了
The point is, if he finds out about this,

392
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,013
他会立马把你这混蛋打发到朱诺市
he's gonna transfer your ass to juneau so fast,

393
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,027
整得你晕头转向
your head will spin.

394
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:05,003
拉里
Larry.

395
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,030
我的上帝
Oh, my god.

396
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,064
我还以为再也见不到你了
I thought I'd never see you again.

397
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:24,008
你能否得到盖奇探员的电话记录
Were you able to access agent Gedge's phone records?

398
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:27,031
能
Yeah.

399
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,078
我能
Yeah,

400
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,008
在之前的三个小时  盖奇和另一个
over the last three hours, Gedge spoke repeatedly

401
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,098
探员保持密切联系  他叫爱德华·沃斯勒
to another secret service agent named Edward Vossler.

402
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:36,028
我查了沃斯勒的个人档案
I checked out Vossler's personnel records.

403
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:38,085
担任特勤局探员以前  他在特种部队
Before he was a secret service agent,he was special forces

404
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:40,099
并在桑加拉服役两年
and for two years, served in Sangala.

405
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,009
那我们可以假设沃斯勒为杜巴库效命
So we can assume Vossler's working for Dubaku.

406
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,016
有没有带着这些文件
Did you bring any of his files with you?

407
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,090
带了
Yeah.

408
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:53,063
沃斯勒有家人吗
Does vossler have a family?

409
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:55,094
你问这个干嘛
Why do you need to know that?

410
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:57,047
他有没有家人
Does he have a family?

411
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:59,074
他五年前娶了个律师助手
He's been married for five years to a paralegal.

412
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:02,028
并生有一个11月大的小男孩
They have an 11-month-old baby boy.

413
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:04,008
她辞了工作在家带孩子
She left her job to stay home with the kid.

414
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,035
好  我们要分头行动了
Okay, we're gonna need to split up.

415
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,098
我要你去跟踪沃斯勒
I need you to help me track Vossler.

416
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:10,025
你去他家  找到他的家人
I need you to go to his home and hope his family is there.

417
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:11,089
沃斯勒曾是特种兵
Vossler was special forces.

418
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,079
这么短的时间  我们无法撬开他的嘴
There's no way we're gonna break him in the time that we've got.

419
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,096
要让他合作  我们只能让他认为
The only way to get him to cooperate is to make him

420
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,092
我们会伤及他的老婆孩子
think we're gonna hurt his family, his wife and his kid.

421
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:20,006
不  绝对不行  蕾妮
No, absolutely not. Renee?

422
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,036
那样做有些过火了  杰克
That's stepping over the line, Jack.

423
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:23,013
你审问坦纳的时候
You stepped over the line

424
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,033
也很过火
the second you interrogated tanner.

425
00:20:24,034 --> 00:20:25,083
坦纳是个杀人犯
Tanner's a murderer.

426
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:28,017
而目前看来  沃斯勒的妻子完全是无辜的
As far as we know, Vossler's wife is completely innocent,

427
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,034
更不用说一个小娃娃了
let alone a small child.

428
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,007
你们这些家伙什么时候能不再
When are you people gonna stop thinking

429
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,037
痴心妄想地认为世人都会循规蹈矩呢
everyone else is following your rules?!

430
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:33,084
他们不会
They're not!

431
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:35,054
杜巴库会在45分钟内
Dubaku is gonna kill Henry Taylor

432
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:37,088
杀了亨利·泰勒  除非我们找到他
within the next 45 minutes unless we find him.

433
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:40,018
有两条路摆在你面前
You got to have one of two choices.

434
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:42,025
要么你可以打电话给总统  向她解释
Now you can either phone the president and explain to her

435
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:43,052
你的良知不允许你
that your conscience won't allow you

436
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:45,022
采取必要手段去救他
to do what is necessary to save him,

437
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:49,002
要么就采取必要手段去做该做的事
Or you can simply do what is necessary.

438
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:51,073
选一个吧
Pick one!

439
00:20:55,057 --> 00:20:56,066
蕾妮
Renee?

440
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:58,017
拉里
Larry!

441
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,027
蕾妮
Renee?

442
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:05,091
我要用你的车
I'm gonna need your vehicle.

443
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:07,047
利用特工的专用网络
Start tracking Vossler through his cell phone.

444
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:09,024
通过手机追踪沃斯勒
Utilize his secret service deployment grid.

445
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:11,008
看看你自己吧
Look at yourself.

446
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:15,022
因为去做你认为该做的事情
You've lost everyone and everything you ever had

447
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,038
你已经失去了一切
by doing what you think is necessary.

448
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,089
我不会让她步你的后尘  鲍尔
I won't let you do it to her, Bauer.

449
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,070
蕾妮不会和你一个下场的
Renee will not end up like you.

450
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:31,004
你到底给不给我车钥匙
Are you gonna give me your keys or not?

451
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:47,018
杰克
Jack.

452
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,076
杰克
Jack!

453
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,032
规则都是为我们好
The rules are what make us better.

454
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:55,096
今天不是
Not today.

455
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:09,050
即使是那些反对进军桑加拉的人
Even those who oppose the plan to invade Sangala

456
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:13,031
也无法否认朱玛政权的暴行
can't deny the atrocities committed by that regime.

457
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,048
我减缓了泰勒出血的速度
I slowed down Taylor's bleeding,

458
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:17,011
但不能完全止血
but I can't get it to stop completely.

459
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:18,038
止血绷带已经是最紧了吗
Tourniquet is as tight as possible?

460
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,071
是的
Yes.

461
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,071
那就通过灼烧伤口止血吧
Then cauterize the wound.

462
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,012
米卡利有焊枪
Mikali has a blowtorch.

463
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,022
泰勒会休克的
You risk Taylor going into shock.

464
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:24,095
把他的嘴塞住
Just put something in his mouth.

465
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:26,085
我可不想他因为疼痛把舌头咬掉
I don't want him biting his tongue off with the pain.

466
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:29,089
你在家干什么呢
Hey, what are you doing at home, huh?

467
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,029
我以为你在上班呢
I thought you'd be at work.

468
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,046
刚刚是  但在餐馆时罗莎给我打电话
I was. Rosa called me at the diner.

469
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:36,050
她又给我讲她的大道理了
She was having one of her episodes.

470
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:38,067
你知道你姐的  她只想操控你
You know your sister. She's just manipulating you.

471
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:40,083
你不必每次都随叫随到
You don't have to go to her every time she calls.

472
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:43,035
我是她的依靠  萨缪尔  对她好点儿
I'm all she has, Samuel. Be kind.

473
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,007
你知道  你对我们都很好
You know, you're kind enough for both of us.

474
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:47,054
我只想确认一下
I just wanted to make sure

475
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:49,031
你今晚会不会回来吃饭
that you were still coming to dinner tonight.

476
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:53,038
抱歉  我去不了
Um, look, I'm really sorry, but I can't.

477
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,008
我手头有一堆运单
I'm looking at a stack of shipping manifests.

478
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:58,028
不是吧  就不能想想办法吗
Oh, no! Isn't there some way?

479
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,029
你想多晚吃都可以的
We could do it as late as you want.

480
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,082
我也希望我能
I really wish I could.

481
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,026
对不起  玛丽卡
I'm sorry, Marika.

482
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:06,043
听着  宝贝
Uh, listen, baby,

483
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:08,026
我会补偿你的  好吗
I'll make it up to you, okay?

484
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:10,030
好吧  我还是会多做些菜
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make extra

485
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:12,000
以防你改变主意
just in case you change your mind.

486
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:13,037
你对我太好了
You're too good to me.

487
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,021
你说对了
You're right.

488
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:22,044
我得回餐馆去了  罗莎
I have to get back to the diner, rosa.

489
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,044
你还好吧
Are you gonna be okay?

490
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:25,035
你刚才和谁通话
Who was that on the phone?

491
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,052
是他吗
It was him, wasn't it?

492
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:29,068
行了
All right, stop.

493
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:32,012
我知道你不喜欢塞缪尔
I know you don't approve

494
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:34,002
但我爱他
of Samuel, but I love him.

495
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:35,082
你爱他
Oh. You love him?

496
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,072
为什么
Why?

497
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:40,033
因为他出手大方
Because he spends money on you?

498
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:42,013
因为他帮我们付房租
Because he pays our rent?

499
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:43,056
你和他认识不过
You've only known him

500
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:44,060
才四个月
four months.

501
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:45,083
难道这真的很重要吗
What difference does that make?

502
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:47,070
你根本不了解他
You don't know anything about him.

503
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:50,067
他真如自己口口声声所说是进口商么
What if he's not the importer he says he is?

504
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:53,011
万一是个偷渡客呢
Or that he's in this country illegally?

505
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:54,027
你又来了
Not this again.

506
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:55,084
我只想保护你  玛丽卡
I'm just trying to protect you, Marika.

507
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,098
我需要你的保护
I don't need your protection.

508
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:59,042
你需要
Yes, you do.

509
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:02,068
这个人不是
This man isn't...

510
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:05,023
不是什么
Isn't what?

511
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,012
没什么
Nothing.

512
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:12,043
算了
Forget it.

513
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:14,043
对不起  我没时间讨论这个
I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.

514
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:16,077
轮班后我再回来
I'll be home after my shift.

515
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:35,048
我们可以假意顺从杜巴库的第一个要求
We can appear to comply with the first part of Dubaku's demand

516
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,005
让舰队后撤
by pulling the fleet back.

517
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:40,019
然后我们再从外海发起攻击
Then we simply launch the invasion from farther out at sea.

518
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,076
他的第二个要求有点麻烦
Now, the second part of his demand is more complicated.

519
00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:45,012
如果我们真要交出马托波
If we were really turning Matobo over,

520
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:46,089
他现在应该在车上了
We'd be putting him in a car right about now.

521
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,016
这不可能  我们要保护他
That's out of the question. We need him safe.

522
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:52,090
的确  但我们可以找个替身
Agreed. But we can send a car with a look-alike.

523
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:55,034
顺利的话  杜巴库到最后时刻
If we handle it right, Dubaku won't be aware of the deception

524
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,060
才会察觉到
until the last minute.

525
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,024
那时我们可能已经找到亨利了
By then, hopefully, we'll have found Henry.

526
00:24:58,025 --> 00:25:02,045
总统阁下  您同意这么做吗
Madame president,do we have your authorization to proceed?

527
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,045
好吧
Yes.

528
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,005
我是鲍尔
This is Bauer.

529
00:25:14,006 --> 00:25:16,006
我找到沃斯勒了  他在环路上
Okay, I've got Vossler. He's on the beltway

530
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:20,003
在贝塞斯达附近  向南行进  距你7英里
Near Bethesda, moving south, about seven miles from you.

531
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:22,036
收到  我正赶往  他要去哪
Copy that. I'm on my way. Where's he headed?

532
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:24,020
特勤局纪录显示
According to the secret service log,

533
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:25,083
他在4点换班
his shift starts at 4:00 p.m.

534
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:28,030
他要到安德鲁斯去机场接某位国外高官
He's meeting a foreign dignitary's plane at Andrews.

535
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:30,007
杰克  你知道
Jack, I don't have to tell you--

536
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:31,057
他一旦到了那
Once he's through that gate and onto that base,

537
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:33,007
你就动不了他了
you're not going to be able to touch him.

538
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:35,014
他要到达那里  得在337号路上
Okay, he's going to have to double back on the 337

539
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:36,078
折返两次
if he wants to get through that main gate.

540
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,081
我走康乃狄格路应该能赶上他
I should be able to make up time by taking connecticut.

541
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:40,071
帮我盯住他
Just keep sight of him.

542
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,045
蕾妮给你打电话了吗
have you heard from Renee?

543
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:45,082
她到了沃斯勒家吗
Do we know if she's arrived at Vossler's house yet?

544
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,069
没  但如果她有麻烦
No. But she knows how to get in touch with us

545
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,026
会联系我们的
if she's in trouble.

546
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:11,022
来了
Coming.

547
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,032
有事吗
Can I help you?

548
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:18,032
你是谁
Who are you?

549
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:20,059
闭嘴  照我说的做
Shut up. Do what I tell you, and there's a chance

550
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,046
就饶你们不死
you'll live through this.

551
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:46,037
-别动  -他吓坏了
- Don't move!  - He's scared.

552
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,070
别动  不然我就开枪
Stay where you are or I will shoot you where you stand.

553
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,044

坐下

555
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:55,041

就这样对我们
Doing this to us.

557
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:59,095
你应该问你丈夫

558
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:02,062
什么意思
What are you talking about?

559
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:05,059
爱德华是个好人
Edward is a good man.

560
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:08,019
也许你还不够了解他
Maybe you don't know him quite as well as you think you do.

561
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:10,059
-他不会用枪指着小孩  -闭嘴
- I know he would never point a gun near a child.  - Shut up!

562

把自己铐上
Put the cuff around your wrist.

563
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:18,053
别这样
Don't do this.

00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,087
快点

565

他停下来了
He's stopped in traffic.

568
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:37,062
我在赶往艾伦福德和奥斯的

571
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:48,033
他车开了

572
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,033

我在百特路上

他在哪里
Where is he?

590
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,044

601
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,093
康纳怎么哭了
Why is Conner crying?

602
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:34,024
我的上帝  爱德华
Oh, my god, Edward.

603
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,057
出什么事了  他们是谁

604
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:39,091
你没时间了
You are running out of time.

605
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:41,061
别逼我做不想做的事
I didn't want to have to do this.

606
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:44,051
不  不要

Oh, my god, She's doing something to conner!

609

别动我孩子
Let go of my baby!

610
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:55,076
他只是个孩子  求你了

For god's sake, Edward, tell them what they want to know!

Damn it! All right, all right, I'll tell you!

614

停下  我一会打给你

615
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:19,078
你的孩子没事
Your baby's fine.

616
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:26,039
你这个恶魔
You're a monster!

617
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,099
他在哪里
Where is he?!

618
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:31,099
不说的话  别怪我
You tell me now, or the situation

619
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,046
对你家人不客气
for your family goes from bad to worse.

620
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:34,096
他在哪里
Where is he?

621
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:37,093
我说了难道你就不杀他们
How do I know you're just not going to kill them anyway?

622
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,047
你没得选择
You don't.

623
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:43,054
好吧
Fine.

624
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:47,011
在一个杂货店  阿林顿大街12451号
There's a greengrocer, 12451 arlington avenue.

625

入口
Access.

627
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,091

00:30:50,091 --> 00:30:52,001
但一般是锁着的

629
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,038
-杜巴库也在吗  -是的
- Is Dubaku with him?  - He was.

630
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:54,072
有几个看守

633
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:48,043

634
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,021

下车
Get out of the car now!

637
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:59,081
快点  快点
Move! Move!

638
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,059
行动目的是让我们看上去在交出
The goal is to make it look like we're going to hand Matobo over

639
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,066
马托波  并尽可能拖延时间
for as long as is reasonably possible.

640
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:28,007
你到了约定地点后 和敌人保持距离
When you get to the rendezvous point, keep your distance from dubaku's men.

641

让他们看到你在后座

但别下车

643
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:34,024
别让他们靠得太近
Don't let them get any closer than you feel comfortable with.

644
00:32:34,024 --> 00:32:38,004
如果情况不对 马上走人
As soon as you start to feel that the risk is unacceptable, get the hell out.

645
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:41,098

If you get there before I do, I want you to stand down.

652
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,043
杜巴库安排了至少4个武装分子守在那
Dubaku's got at least four gunmen there.

653
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:03,000

给他通告下目前的情况

655
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,000
你同样也去通知拉里

-沃斯勒呢  -死了
And what about vossler? he's dead.

657
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,031
他进行了反抗  我别无选择
He attacked me. I didn't have a choice.

658
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,068
你没事吧
Are you okay?

659
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:20,015
不  不好
No, I don't think I am.

660
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,059
什么意思  怎么了
What do you mean? what's wrong?

661
00:33:25,082 --> 00:33:27,093
沃克探员  你在听吗
Agent walker, are you still there?

662
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:30,073
我不...
I'm not...

663
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:32,083
听我说
Listen to me.

664
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:35,060
我们能走到这一步  多亏了你
We could not have gotten this far if it wasn't for you.

665
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,034
懂吗
Okay?

666
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:39,019
你承受得太多了
No one would blame you

667
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,011
没人会为此责怪你的
if this was just too much for you to handle.

668
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:44,041
也许你不该干这行
Maybe you should get out.

669
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,098
也许吧
Maybe I will.

670
00:33:46,098 --> 00:33:49,041
好吧
Yeah.

671
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:52,015
等明天再说吧
Tomorrow.

672
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:05,023
迈森探员和我已经上路了

我们会通过卫星追踪你们

674
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,073
接近发电厂就向我报告
Check in with me when you're approaching the power plant.

675
00:34:08,073 --> 00:34:09,080
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

676
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,000
你觉得这能为我们争取多少时间
How much time do you think this will buy us?

677
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,004
可以拖延到杜巴库发现马托波不在车里
Until dubaku realizes matobo's not in the limo.

678
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:16,074
10分钟吧  也许15分钟
Ten minutes, maybe 15.

679
00:34:16,074 --> 00:34:18,098
这又为我们争取了15分钟
That's 15 minutes more than we had.

680
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:22,001
总统阁下  我刚和杰克·鲍尔通过电话
Madame president, I just got off the phone with jack bauer.

681
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,035
他和沃克探员知道你丈夫在哪了
He and agent walker think they have a location on your husband.

682
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:25,078
在哪
Where?

683
00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:27,032
阿林顿大街  他们在路上了
Arlington avenue. they're on their way now.

684
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,029
多久能赶到
How long will it take them?

685
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,079
10到15分钟
Ten, 15 minutes.

686
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,082
谢谢
Thank you.

687
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,053
这是刚从国土安全局发来的

688
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:39,076
就像你说的
Like you said--

689
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,000
我们都被蒙在鼓里了
We're being kept out of the loop.

690
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,067
谢谢
Thanks.

691
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:51,078
你看到吗
Did you see this?

692
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:55,021
国土安全局准备降低警戒等级
Homeland's preparing to lower the threat level

693
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:56,035
总统亲自下的令
At the president's request.

694
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:57,048
对  我看到更新的通知了
Yeah, I saw the flash.

695
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:59,015
你不觉得很奇怪吗
Don't you think that's odd,

696
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,039
我们竟全然不知已找到CIP装置
Considering we don't know anything about the cip device being recovered?

697
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,006
对  我会和国土安全局谈一下
Yeah. I'll talk to homeland.

698
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:05,079
我说的是  我觉得
All I'm saying is... I get the feeling

699
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,096
好像有人背着我们暗中行事
Like there's something going on behind our back here.

700
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:10,016
像我说的  我会和他们谈的
Like I said, I'll talk to them.

701
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:17,050
-失陪  -好的
Excuse me. yeah, sure.

702
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:21,097
你在哪
Where are you?

703
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:24,024
正在去亨利·泰勒被关的地方
On my way to where we think henry taylor's being held.

704
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:27,031
看来你们让沃斯勒招供了
So you got vossler to talk.

705
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:30,032
我们只有一线希望救出总统的丈夫
It gave us our only chance to rescue the president's husband.

706
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,032
地址是什么
What's the address?

707
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:32,075
我会派特警组与你们会合
I'll send a swat team to meet you.

708
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:33,089
你知道你不能那么做
You know you can't do that.

709
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,099
调查局有内鬼
The bureau's compromised.

710
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:37,029
这会让我们所有的努力功亏一篑
It will jeopardize any attempt that we make.

711
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:39,052
但我有别的事要你做
But there is something else I need you to do.

712
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:41,009
好  什么事
Okay, what's that?

713
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:42,043
对一件事守口如瓶
Keep an incident quiet

714
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:44,060
直到我和杰克搞定一切
Until what jack and I are doing goes down.

715
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
什么事
What incident?

716
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,010
沃斯勒死了
Vossler's dead.

717
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,017
杰克在第18街和里根街路口的酒店杀了他
Jack killed him at the hotel on 18th and riggin.

718
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:50,024
他是正当防卫
It was self-defense.

719
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,087
他就是这么糊弄你的吗
Is that what he told you?

720
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:54,087
-拉里  -该死  蕾妮  你和他到底想干嘛
Larry... damn it, renee, what the hell are you doing with this guy?

721
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:57,011
我们应将嫌犯捉拿归案  而不是取人性命
We're supposed to bring suspects in, not murder them.

722
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,044
拉里  求你了
Larry, please...

723
00:35:58,044 --> 00:36:01,008
在我们查出杜巴库的内线之前
And until we know who dubaku's source is there,

724
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:03,098
你得摆脱调查局单干了  好吗
You've got to handle this outside of the bureau, okay?

725
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:10,092
我在特区警局里有个哥们
There's a guy at d.c. metro I know I can trust.

726
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:12,069
我让他善后沃斯勒的事
I'll have him deal with vossler.

727
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,009
谢谢你  拉里
Thank you, larry.

728
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:20,027
明白  我会告诉他的
I understand. I will let him know.

729
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:23,050
我们的线人说  马托波刚刚坐车
According to our sources, a vehicle containing matobo

730
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,090
-离开了白宫  -很好
Just left the white house. good.

731
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,064
美军目前的情况如何
What is the state of the american invasion forces?

732
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:27,091
舰队正在从
The fleet is withdrawing

733
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:29,084
桑加拉的领海撤退
From sangalan territorial waters,

734
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:31,061
已退至23度子午线
And has set its team for the 23rd meridian.

735
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:33,028
太好了
Excellent.

736
00:36:33,028 --> 00:36:34,038
喂
Hello.

737
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:35,095
我是罗莎
It's rosa.

738
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:38,078
罗莎  你要找玛丽卡的话  她不在我身边
Rosa, if you're looking for marika, she's not with me.

739
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:40,008
我找的是你  塞缪尔
I'm looking for you, samuel.

740
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:42,045
或许这不是你的真名
Or whatever your real name is.

741
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:45,029
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

742
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:47,049
我妹妹也许很单纯  但我不傻
My sister may be naive, but I'm not.

743
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:51,023
我从一个移民局的朋友那打听到
I checked with someone I know at immigration services,

744
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:54,073
无论是去年还是过去的15年里  都没有叫
And no one named samuel aboa emigrated from sangala

745
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:57,030
塞缪尔·安博的人从桑加拉移民过来
In the last year, or in the last 15 years.

746
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,044
很显然他们弄错了
Well, they've obviously made a mistake.

747
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:00,091
是你错了
You're making a mistake.

748
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:03,074
我不想知道你究竟是谁  也不在乎
Now I don't know who you really are, and I don't care.

749
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:05,081
我只想让你远离我妹妹
I just want you out of my sister's life.

750
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:07,011
玛丽卡知道这些吗
Does marika know about this?

751
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:09,031
还没
No, not yet.

752
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:11,002
她还是不知情的好
And I'm willing to keep it that way.

753
00:37:11,002 --> 00:37:12,095
你没有向任何人举报我吗
So you've not reported me to anyone?

754
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:16,055
没有  我不想玛丽卡知道这事
No. I don't want marika to know anything about this.

755
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:18,086
你想怎样
What do you want?

756
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,036
和她分手
Break up with her,

757
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:22,096
我就保证不说出去
And this stays between us.

758
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:24,030
今晚就分手
You just end it tonight,

759
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,033
我们就井水不犯河水
And we won't have a problem.

760
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:38,058
我得去处理个小麻烦
I have to take care of a little problem.

761
00:37:38,058 --> 00:37:40,051
一抓到马托波就通知我
Call me when we have matobo.

762
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,033
请讲
Yeah.

763
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:16,096
载着马托波的车
The vehicle that's supposed to be delivering matobo

764
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:19,007
快到达发电厂了  稍有迟疑
Is arriving at the power plant. if we delay any longer,

765
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,097
杜巴库就会生疑  你那情况怎样
Dubaku is going to get suspicious. what's your status?

766
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:24,044
-我快到了  还能争取多少时间  -不知道  杰克
I'm almosthere. how much time can you buy us? I dot know, jack.

767
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:27,037
好  我一到就和沃克探员进去
Okay, agent walker and I will move in as soon as I get there.

768
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,044
我会随时向你汇报
I'll keep you posted.

769
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:30,024
好的  祝你好运
All right, good luck.

770
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:31,071
我是史密斯探员

771
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:33,075
-我们看到了杜巴库的人了  -收到

把他交给我们
Bring him to us.

774
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,008
他们命令我们下车
They've ordered us to get out of the car.

775
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:14,032
-一个人在打电话  -再坚持一会  探员
Now one of them is making a call. hang tight, agent.

776
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:16,009
他们的车到了
Their car arrived,

777
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,046
-但是没有动静  -没有动静是什么意思

我们让他们把马托波交给我们
We ordered them to hand matobo over to us

779
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,063
但是没人下车
But no one's getting out of the vehicle.

780
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:24,096
美国佬耍了我们

轰了他们的车

And I want you to ask those men what they want to eat.

790
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,032
要是你胆敢乱来
You do one thing I don't like,

791
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:27,086
我就让你脑袋开花  懂吗
And I will blow your head off, you understand me?

792
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:29,044
开门

杀了亨利·泰勒
Kill henry taylor.

797
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:56,028
那我们就没有威胁他们的筹码了
Then we have nothing to hold over their heads.

798
00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:58,028
我们已经没有了
We don't have anything now.

799
00:41:58,029 --> 00:42:00,032
总统已不管他的死活
The president was willing to let him die.

800
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:01,042
我们没戏了
