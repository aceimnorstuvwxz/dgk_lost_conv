你认为我相信你 我就...
You think, I trust you,that I am gonna just...

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:12,024
做完手术你就让我走人?

5
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,079
你必须得做

6
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,062

7
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:17,016
-他们给你什么好处?  -什么都没有
-What did they offer you?  -Nothing.

8
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:21,091
-那你来这儿干什么?  -他们要杀了 Sawyer...
-Then what are you doing here?  -They're gonna kill Sawyer...

10
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:32,040

11
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:36,018
我准备好了
I'm ready.

12
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,029
Sawyer 求你了!

13
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:42,003
别碰他!
You get your hands off of him!

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,056
我刚在Ben的肾脏旁边切了一个口
I just made a small incision in Ben's kidney sac.

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:49,032
如果我一小时内不帮他缝上 他就会死

21
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,055
我刚才睡着了
I fell asleep.

22
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:30,062
那很安全的
With candles burning..that's real safe.

23
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,062
我们不用一直这样做的
We don't have to keep doing this,you know.

24
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:41,038
你这样说是因为你觉得这些没用吗?
Are you saying that because you don't think it's gonna work

25
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:45,032
还是害怕他会发现这一切?
or because you're afraid he'll find out?

26
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,084
把上衣拉起来
Lift up your shirt.

27
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:11,085
医生都像你这样
Some doctor you are.

28
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:13,040
我这样做不是因为我是医生
I'm not doing this as your doctor.

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,082
而是因为我是你姐姐
I'm doing it as your sister.

30
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:20,011
我不希望你单独在这儿
I don't like you being here alone.

31
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:21,082
搬来和我一起住吧
Come stay with me.

32
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:24,092
我喜欢住在海滩上
I like living on the beach.

33
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:28,012
这是迈阿密 Rachel
This is Miami, Rachel.

34
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:31,044
一切都在海滩上
Everything's on the beach.

35
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:38,092
你们有大约一个小时的时间逃走 他们不会去追你
You have about an hour head start before they come after you.

36
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,077
带上对讲机 带上 Sawyer 跑
Take the walkie, take Sawyer and go.

37
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:42,021
等等  你在哪儿?你在哪?
Wait. Where are you?

38
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,012
Kate 听我说
Kate, listen to me. Just listen to me.

39
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:45,085
记得我在海滩上和你说的话吗?
You remember what I told you on the beach?

40
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:50,015
我讲给你的故事 当你帮我缝针的时候?
Do you rember what story I told you when you were stitching me up?

41
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,020
你记得吗?!
Do you rember it?!

42
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,051
是的  我记得!
Yes, yes, I remember!

43
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:58,041
当你安全了 你用对讲机给我讲那个故事
When you get safe, you radio me and you tell me that story.

44
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,042
Jack 求你了...
Jack, please...

45
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:01,046
如果一小时后我听不到你的声音
If I don't get a call from you in the next hour,

46
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:03,059
我就知道事情不对 他死定了!
I'm gonna know something went wrong,and he dies!

47
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,019
我不能抛下你不管
I can't leave without you.

48
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,025
不  你要这样做

49
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,044
-Jack 我不能!  -现在就跑
-Jack, I can't!  -Go, now.

50
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,078
我做不到!
I can't!

51
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:13,049
Kate 不要说了 快跑!
Kate, damn it, run!

52
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:19,067
Juliet 为他止血 帮他缝合
Juliet, stop the bleeding and stitch him up.

53
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,073
她不是外科医生
She's not a surgeon.

54
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:23,073
所以她办不到
She can't fix this.

55
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,014
他是对的
He's right.

56
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:37,098
我们快跑
Let's go.

57

59
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:58,052

62
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:08,036
-如果你这样做 Ben 就死定了  -快去
-No, you do that, and Ben dies.  -Go.

63
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:10,081
你认为我是在开玩笑吗?
You think I'm lying?Do you think this is a bluff?

64
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:15,055
-我说到做到!  -Jack 你不会的
-I will let him die!  -No, Jack, you won't.

65
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:19,049
去带他们回来
Go. Get them back.

66
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:22,067
如果必要的话...

00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:25,079
杀了他们

72
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,087

78
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:27,081
你到底在这干什么?
Why exactly are you here?

79
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,077

今天的实验室工作...
today's lab work...

81
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:33,084
回到家我发现自己算错了些数字

82
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:36,048

88
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,069
我的前妻

89
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:54,055
Juliet 现在就走
Juliet's leaving.

90
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,050
是的
I am.

91
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:07,018
你能把灯关了吗?
Could you please turn off the lights?

92
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,050
你还是想不通吗? Jack
You haven't thought this through, Jack.

93
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,020
你的计划行不通的
Your plan's not gonna work.

94
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,041
是吗? 为什么?
Yeah? Why is that?

95
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,061
你的朋友回不到你们那边的岛上
Your friends aren't going to make it back to your side

96
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:27,046
因为我们在另一座岛上
of the island because we're not on that island.

97
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:31,097
我们在两公里远的另一个更小的岛上
We're on a smaller island 2 miles offshore.

98
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:35,052
恐怕是这样
'Fraid so.

99
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:41,089
那么我们为什么不讨论下
So why don't we see if we can come up

100
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,097
和平的解决方案?
with some kind of peaceful resolution?

101
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:47,046
和平的方案?
A peaceful resolution?

102
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:48,048
是的
That's right.

103
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:50,060
这就是你所谓的 让我杀死 Ben
Is that what you call asking me to kill Ben

104
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,021
在手术台上...
while on the operang table...

105
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,077
-让别人以为是医疗事故?  -那真是荒唐
-Make it look like an accident?  -That's ridiculous.

106
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:57,035
-她想让 Ben 去死  -他在撒谎
-She wants Ben to die.  -He's lying.

107
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,075
她承诺我如果我这样做的话...她会保护我的
She said if I did it,that she would protect me...

108
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:00,095
够了!
Enough!

109
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,091
滚出去
Get out.

110
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,027
Tom 他说的不是真的
Tom, he's lying.

111
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,027
你说你不能帮他缝合...
You said you can't stitch him up...

112
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,023
那你就没必要留在这儿
then you don't need to be in here.

113
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:15,023
去吧 Julie.
Go, Julie.

114
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:23,034
别让他把你给耍了
Don't let him fool you.

115
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:27,039
他绝对不会让一个病人这样去死的
He'll never let a patient just die.

116
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:35,089
有人听见我吗?!
Can anybody hear me?!

117
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,045
怎么了?
What happened?

118
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,050
打开笼子
Open the cage.

119
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,043
打开这该死的笼子
Just open the damn cage!

120
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,041
那是我们那个岛吗?
That's our island?

121
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,055
你不相信我告诉你的?
What, you didn't believe me when I told you before?

122
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:06,090
我们需要一艘船
We need a boat.

123
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,000
是啊 几块餐巾和自助餐吗?
Yeah, a couple of towels and a buffet lunch.

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,015
我们沿着海滩走
We'll keep following the beach.

125
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,091
这儿一定会有一条船
There's gotta be one around here somewhere.

126
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:12,082
否则他们是怎么往返的?
How else do they get back and forth?

127
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:17,006
你为什么不停下? 问一下我们的方位?
Why don't we just stop and ask for directions?

128
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:21,002
Jack 你在吗?
Jack, are you there?

129
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:22,073
-是的  -你还好吗?
-Yeah, I'm here.  -Are you okay?

130
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:25,037
-我很好  -怎么不帮我向他打招呼?
-I'm fine.  -Tell him I said "hi"?

131
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:26,074
-切入主题啊!  -Jack 我们需要一条船
-Get to the point!  -We need a boat.

132
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:29,095
我们要想办法离开这个岛
We need some way to get off of this island.

133
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,099
你听见了?
You heard her.

134
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:35,070
他们怎么才能离开这?!
How do they get off this island?!

135
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:38,074
他在干吗?
What's he doing?

136
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:53,036
快追!
Come on!

137
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:38,056
这边走!
This way!

138
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:42,001
Jason 你还好吗?
Jason, you all right?

139
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,032
在那边 在那边!
Over there! There!

140
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:58,016
快点钻进去!
Come on! Get inside, get inside! Go!

141
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,030
快!
Come on!

142
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:10,009
轻点 轻点!
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

143
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:14,098
怎么了?
What?

144
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:16,068
他们朝哪里跑了?
Where'd they go?

145
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,068
那边
That way.

146
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:31,063
很高兴见到你 Sheena
Nice to meet you, Sheena.

147

148
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,036
你指什么?
Is what true?

149
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:37,041
你刚才说的...
What you said...

150
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:41,063
Juliet 真的让你杀了他吗?
Did Juliet really ask you to kill him?

151
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,053
当然...
Yeah...

152
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:47,093
还有大约40分钟 她的愿望就要实现了
and in about 40 minutes,she's gonna get her wish.

153
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:57,005
这样... 没有... 任何帮助...
That's... not... helping...

154
00:12:57,005 --> 00:13:00,005
所有一切
anything.

155
00:13:03,006 --> 00:13:05,056
现在...
Now...

156
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:10,025
谁能帮我找到 Juliet?
could somebody please get Juliet?

157
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,016
Juliet  Edmund 想和你谈谈
Edmund wants to see you in his office.

158
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,040
你是这里的员工?
Do you work here?

159
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,097
我是新来的助理
I'm the new research assistant.

160
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,031
当然
Of course you are.

161
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:51,064
我要你说出真相
I want in.

162
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:52,079
什么真相
In on what?

163
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,034
我知道你在做什么 Juliet
I know what you're doing, Juliet.

164
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,055
我真的不知道...
I'm not really sure what...

165
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:01,015
我读了你的笔记
I read your notes.

166
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:02,075
我知道你从实验室拿了什么
I know what you took from the lab.

167
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:05,085
我唯一不知道的是...
The only thing I don't know is...

168
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:09,052
你是在帮谁?
who's your guinea pig?

169
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,008
Ed 我...
Ed, I've...

170
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:16,079
我只是在做我自己的工作
I've been doing my research in my own lab, on my own time.

171
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,013
-我真的不知道..  -是你妹妹 不是吗?
-I don't really see..  -It's your sister, isn't it?

172
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:26,004
Jules 你有两条路可走...
Look, Jules,there's two ways this plays out...

173
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:33,016
一条是 你的研究大有前途
One is, your research is potentially genius.

174
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:35,027
另一条是
And the other,

175
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:39,072
你有伦理道德上的问题
you're raising some very serious ethical questions,

176
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:43,060
也许甚至触发犯罪...
maybe even criminal concerns...

177
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:47,083
但要是你和我合作的话
but if you collaborate with me,

178
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,093
基于我的名誉
based on my reputation,

179
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:55,037
我们将突破科学的边缘
all this is viewed as cutting edge science.

180
00:14:55,037 --> 00:15:01,047
然后为成就举杯庆祝
And we will win prizes and drink Champagne

181
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:05,050
这样能为人类做出贡献
and do a lot of good for people.

182
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:18,008
我给你一些时间想想清楚
Why don't I give you some time to think about it?

183
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:40,008
Ben 醒了
Ben's awake.

184
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,090
怎么可能?
How?

185
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:47,030
Shephard 说他是脊柱外科医生 不是麻醉师
Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon,not an anesthesiologist.

186
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:51,030
Ben 要你去
Ben's asking for you.

187
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:02,073
你的兴趣就是挖洞吗?
This a hobby of yours, underdog,digging holes?

188
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:05,048
是的 还有织网
Yep, that and basket weaving.

189
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,023
你指哪样?
Want one?

190
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:10,014
那这里有没有一个通向大陆的通道?
Happen to have a tunnel to the mainland?

191
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:13,046
没有 但我有条船
No, but I've got a boat.

192
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:14,060
我们能用它吗?
Can we use it?

193
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,061
是的 但我们得赶快
Yeah, but we've got to hurry.

194
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:18,011
等等 小妞
Hold on a second, sister.

195
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:21,008
你就这样碰巧在丛林里找到我们 又碰巧有条船?
You just happen to find us in the woods,you just happen to have a boat,

196
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:24,042
还帮我们逃走?
and you're gonna let us use it, huh?

197
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,007
我们得先办件事
There's something we need to do first.

198
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,019
哦 天...
Oh, gee...

199
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,062
我的男友被关起来了
My boyfriend is being held prisoner.

200
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,046
如果你们帮我救他 我保证
If you help me rescue him,I promise you,

201
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:34,012
把你们带回到你们来的地方
I'll get you back to the other island.

202
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:39,059
你男朋友..他的名字不会是 Karl 吧?
Your boyfriend..his name happen to be Karl?

203
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:42,087
是的
Yeah.

204
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:46,070
好吧 快走
Ah, come on.

205
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:50,081
我停止了手术
I stopped the surgery.

206
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:53,061
我知道
I know.

207
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:58,017
我隐约听见了些东西
I've been able to hear you for a few minutes now.

208
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,043
你真聪明
It's very clever of you.

209
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:04,009
我应该料到的
I should have seen it coming.

210
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:05,078
你很疼吗?
Are you in pain?

211
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,063
-我可以... -不
-I can...-No.

212
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:12,037
但还是谢谢
But thanks all the same.

213
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:27,072
我希望和 Juliet 单独谈谈 求你了 Jack
I'd like to speak to Juliet alone,please, Jack.

214
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:29,052
抱歉 这样不行
No, I'm sorry.

215
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:37,005
求你了 这是一个绅士的请求
Please, I'm asking you...one gentleman to another.

216
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:39,055
就给我3分钟
It won't hurt you to give me 3 minutes,

217
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:42,000
好吗...
will it...

218
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,074
知道我还有27分钟可活?
Knowing I have only 27 left?

219
00:17:58,095 --> 00:18:00,001
如果你碰他
If you touch him,

220
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:03,032
-如果你想要...  -我不会的
-if you try to...  -I won't.

221
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:09,038
你只有3分钟
You've got three minutes.

222
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,084
我的名字是 Tom
I'm Tom, by the way.

223
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:58,059
他们有过一段历史
They've got history.

224
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:16,097
我希望你能进去
I would like for you to go back in there,

225
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:20,085
完成他的手术
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

226
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:24,053
我为什么要这样做?
And why would I want to do that?

227
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:28,085
我能帮你的朋友逃跑
Because I'm going to go help your friends escape.

228
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:42,040
非常感谢你给我们时间挑选 Dr. Burke.
Thank you for taking the time to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke.

229
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,003
Mittelos 生物学工程的基地在俄勒冈
Mittelos Bioscience is based in Oregon.

230
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:48,055
我们的在波特兰的边上
We're just outside of Portland.

231
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:52,052
这张照片看上去有点 uh cheeseball
These shots might seem a little,uh, cheeseball,

232
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:55,013
但我们的确很高兴
but our people really are this happy.

233
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:57,048
因为我们是私营基金
Now why? Because we're privately funded.

234
00:19:57,048 --> 00:20:01,061
那意味这自由
Privately funded means freedom.

235
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:06,029
我们每星期组织游历波特兰的活动
We organize trips every week in and around the Portland area,

236
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:12,042
是些徒步 单车 和水上活动
which is just awesome for hiking and biking and river running.

237
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,006
但你...
Look, when you...

238
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,030
你们公司找到我时 我真是受宠若惊
your company reached out to me,I was flattered,

239
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,065
但我真的不知道为什么你要...
but I don't really know why you would want me to...

240
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:25,076
你使一只雄性老鼠受精 这是真的吗?
Is it true that you successfully impregnated a male field mouse?

241
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:29,029
这项研究是没有期限的
It didn't carry to term.

242
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:31,022
我能问你些事吗?
Mind if I ask you something?

243
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,022
当然
Sure.

244
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:39,032
你看到了什么?
What do you see?

245
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,076
显然是人的子宫
It's a human womb, obviously.

246
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,097
根据这张图像
Judging from the decomposition of the endometrium,

247
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:48,067
这个子宫属于一个70多岁的老人
I would say that the woman was somewhere in her 70s.

248
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:51,087
不 实际上 她才26岁
No, actually, she's 26.

249
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:53,002
怎么可能?
What happened to her?

250
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:58,054
要是我告诉你你能用 所有的资金去找到答案怎么样?
What if I told you that you could have complete freedom and money to find out?

251
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:01,008
我们认为你很特别 Burke医生
We think you're special, Dr. Burke,

252
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:02,081
我们需要你带领这个团队
and we want you to lead a team

253
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:07,020
或者是训练有素的人员 因为我知道你很出色
of highly trained people because we think you're just that good.

254
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,060
我不能
I can't.

255
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,056
为什么?
Why can't you?

256
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:13,063
我前夫不会让我这样做的 我...
My ex-husband wouldn't let me. I...

257
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,058
他不想让你得到这个机会?
He wouldn't want you to have this opportunity?

258
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:18,032
他什么也不想让我得到
He doesn't want me to have anything.He would never give the okay.

259
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:19,068
我们能和他联系吗?
Maybe we could reach out to him

260
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:21,023
-以你的名义...  -不用麻烦了
-on your behalf...  -Don't bother.

261
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:23,029
他总得有所反应
There must be something that he would respond to.

262
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:28,017
如果他被汽车撞了如何?
If he were hit by a bus..How about that? That would work.

263
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:31,082
这样说太不合适了
That was totally inappropriate.

264
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:35,055
不  不...不  我...
No, no...No, I, uh...

265
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:38,009
很抱歉浪费了你的时间
I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

266
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:41,057
-Burke医生 求你...  -不行 抱歉
-Dr. Burke, please, you...  -No, I'm sorry.

267
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:45,043
我不是你所想象的那样的人
Whatever you think I am, I'm not.

268
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:48,070
我不是一个领袖 Alpert先生
I'm not a leader, Mr. Alpert.

269
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,076
我一团糟
I'm a mess.

270
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,020
该死的
Well, hell.

271
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:49,017
Karl 一定在这里
Karl's gotta be in there.

272
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:51,057
你还不确定吗?
What, you mean you ain't sure?

273
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:53,087
这是唯一我没见过的地方
It's the only place I haven't looked.

274
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:55,044
你认识那个看守?
You know the guard?

275
00:22:55,044 --> 00:22:59,060
是的 他叫 Aldo
Yeah. His name's Aldo.

276
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:02,034
好了 小妞
Okay, Lollipop,

277
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:05,080
我们没枪没子弹 怎么才能过他这关?
you wanna tell me how we're gonna get by him with one gun and no bullets?

278
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,023
我有主意了
I've got an idea.

279
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:11,040
那当然
Of course you do.

280
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,033
把门打开!
Open the door!

281
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:15,034
Alex? 你在这儿干嘛?
Alex? What the hell are you doing?

282
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:18,028
他们一定是逃出来了 我在丛林里抓到他们了
They must've gotten out of their cages.I caught them in the jungle.

283
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:19,034
快把门打开 Aldo!
Now open up, Aldo!

284
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:22,001
停下! 你不该出现在这里的
Just stop!You're not supposed to be here.

285
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,084
如果你爸知道了 他会杀了我的
If your dad finds out,he's gonna kill me.

286
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:28,008
是他让我把他们带来你这里的
My dad was the one who told me to bring them here, to you.

287
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:29,089
哦 也许你可以问问他
Look, maybe you should call him.

288
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:33,076
我相信他没有更好的办法
I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

289
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,093
Danny 我要和 Ben 说话
Danny, I need Ben.

290
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:44,016
干嘛?!
Why?!

291
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:45,017
听着  Alex在这儿
Listen, I got Alex here.

292
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:48,093
她抓了 Austen 和 Ford...
She's got Austen and Ford with her...

293
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,057
可恶 别相信她
Damn it, whatever she says,don't believe it.

294
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:54,042
你守着他们 我...
You hold 'em right there. I'm on my...

295
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:56,063
不要因为你太蠢就冲我来
Don't get mad at me just 'cause you were dumb enough

296
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:59,003
你真不是当看守的料
to fall for the old "wookiee prisoner" gag.

297
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,023
Karl 在哪儿?
Where's Karl?

298
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,041
你在说什么 我不知道!
I have no idea what you're talking about.

299
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,035
射他的膝盖
Shoot him in the knee.

300
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:06,094
-什么?  -把枪给我
-What?  -Give me the rifle.

301
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:10,035
别浪费时间 让我来
We don't have time for this. I'll do it.

302
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:12,075
好吧 好吧! 他被关在大厅末端的23号房间
Okay, all right!He's at the end of the hall, room 23.

303
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:16,018
钥匙在我口袋里
Keys are in my back pocket.

304
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:21,085
干的好 小妞
Damn good con, Freckles.

305
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,081
我还真以为你会射他
I almost believed you were gonna shoot that boy.

306
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:25,090
我可是动真格的
It wasn't a con.

307
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,097
在这里!
Here it is!

308
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:32,071

帮我!
Help!

310
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:38,004
过来帮忙!
Help!

311
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,030
-他还好吗?  -我们已经救出你的男友了
-Is he okay?  -We got your boyfriend back.

312
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,046
那条该死的船在哪里?
Now where's your damn boat?

313
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,028
蠢货!
Idiot!

314
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:15,031
-他们在哪?  -我不知道
-Where are they?  -I don't know.

315
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,094
-Alex 和他们在一起  -Danny!
-Alex was with them.  -Danny!

316
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,030
放他们走!
We're letting them go.

317
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,001
-放他们走?  -这是 Ben 下的命令
-Letting them go?  -Ben gave the order.

318
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,016
-Ben 在手术 我刚去过 -他醒了
-Ben's in surgery. I was just there.-He woke up.

319
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,061
-哦 他醒了?  -Shephard 停止了手术
-Oh, he woke up, huh?  -Shephard won't finish the surgery

320
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:29,072
除非让他的朋友逃走
unless he knows his friends are off the island.

321
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:31,087
你想让 Ben 死吗?
Do you want Ben to die?

322
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:36,079
Ben 死也不放他们走的
I know Ben would rather die than let them go.

323
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:54,098
面试怎么样?
How was the interview?

324
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:56,084
不怎么好
It's not for me.

325
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:59,006
-什么?  -没关系的
-What?  -It's fine.

326
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:01,054
他们在波特兰
They're too far away, anyway.It's Portland.

327
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:03,041
是因为我你才说不的吧 Jules?
Jules, you didn't say no because of me?

328
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:06,050
我怎么会大老远的去波特兰
Well, why would I wanna go all the way to Portland

329
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,080
那地方不适合研究
for research that doesn't even work?

330
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:13,040
因为那能行
Because it does work.

331
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:21,077
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

332
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:28,018
我怀...我怀孕了
I'm pre...I'm pregnant.

333
00:27:28,018 --> 00:27:29,042
怎么可能?
What?

334
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:32,069
看 我有血液测试
Look, look. I took a blood test, too.

335
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:36,060
我想等确定了才告诉你
I didn't want to tell you until I was sure.

336
00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:41,078
-那行的通的  -是的
-It worked.  -Yeah.

337
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:50,018
我一生所求就是想要个孩子
All my life, all I've ever wanted was to have a baby,

338
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:53,082
现在 因为你 我...
and now, because of you, I'm gonna...

339
00:27:57,033 --> 00:28:01,034
天啊 现在我只需要恢复身体
God, now I just need to get healthy.

340
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:03,047
我只需要...只需要恢复身体
Now I just need...I just need to get healthy

341
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:06,087
这样能看着我的小家伙 考上常青藤大学
so I can see the little bugger get into an ivy league school, you know?

342
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:10,096
你会的 你当然会的
You will. Of course you will.

343
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:13,099
你现在能告诉你那无耻的前夫
Hey, now you can tell that bastard ex-husband of yours

344
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:17,075
他是怎么认识伦理的?
what he can do with his ethics.

345
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,021
这是因为你不会忍耐 你很刻薄
Because you're insufferable,and you're mean.

346
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:27,068
妈 你要知道真相 那..
Well, you asked me for the truth, mom,and that's..

347
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:32,007
我一会儿在打来 好吗?
Let me call you later, okay?

348
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:34,039
你好 Jules 怎么啦?
Hello, Jules. What's up?

349
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:36,048
她怀孕了
She's pregnant.

350
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,066
怎么可能?
Excuse me?

351
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:41,070
成功了 Rachel 怀孕了
It worked. Rachel's pregnant.

352
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,050
Julie 那真是...
Julie, that's...

353
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:50,056
我需要看下你的研究
I need,I need to see your labs.

354
00:28:50,056 --> 00:28:52,052
要确认下数据..
We'll have to verify the data before..

355
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:54,037
不行
No.

356
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:57,073
我对登报不感兴趣 ED
I'm not interested in publishing, Ed.

357
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:59,039
她是我妹妹
It's my sister.

358
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,065
也好 如果你不感兴趣的话 你为什么关心..
Fine, then if you're not interested,why are you concerned if..

359
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:24,002
你还好吗?
You okay?

360
00:29:24,002 --> 00:29:26,032
是的
Yeah.

361
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:29,022
只是对血有点过敏
I just don't like blood too much.

362
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:30,063
那...
Well...

363
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:35,040
你一定不愿意看这个
then you probably won't wanna be looking at that.

364
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:40,034
如果你们真能离开这座岛的话
So,if you really can get off the island,

365
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:42,074
怎么不把他带到医院去?
why didn't you just take him to a facility?

366
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,055
为什么要这样?
Why all this?

367
00:29:44,055 --> 00:29:49,016
因为自从天空变成紫色 我们..
Because ever since the sky turned purple, we..

368
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:51,051
到底发生了什么?!
What the hell happened?!

369
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:53,029
我刚割开了他的动脉
I just nicked an artery.

370
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,002
你刚才不是已经做了吗?!
Isn't that what you already did?!

371
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,071
是的 只不过那次是故意的
Yeah, well, that was on purpose.

372
00:29:58,071 --> 00:30:01,028
能弄好吗?
Can you fix it?

373
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:04,028
该死的
Damn it.

374
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:11,087

380
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,082

We both know your father,

401
00:31:55,045 --> 00:32:00,069
他让 Karl 活着的唯一要求是 你在这儿等他醒来
