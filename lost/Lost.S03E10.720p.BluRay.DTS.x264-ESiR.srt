Forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, James.

154
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:11,041
也许他们应该解释为什么 没来找我们
Well, maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us.

Jack 会好的 我们都会好的

262
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,026
我为什么要这样做?
And why in the hell would I do that?

263
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:36,065
因为里面有啤酒
'Cause there's beer.

264
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,098
他为什么说 "不要回来"?
Why did he say, "don't come back"?

265
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:41,043
他牺牲自己让我们逃走
He sacrificed himself so we could escape.

266
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:43,085
他全豁出去了

267
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:46,035
Hurley 告诉我们他们放了 Michael 和 Walt

他们就一去不复返了
They took off and never looked back.

270
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,084
你看见有其它船吗?
Did you see any other boats?

271
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:56,045
没有 但他们不会放弃自己唯一的船
No, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one.

272
00:19:57,037 --> 00:20:01,012
-他们可以离开这座岛吗?  -我不知道 John
-So they can leave the island?  -I don't know, John.

273
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:06,043

This "zoo" where they held you...is that where they live?

他说他们住在这座岛上
He said that they live on this island.

276
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,076
他能带我们去那儿 但 Sawyer 放了他
He could've taken us there,but Sawyer let him go.

277
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:14,013
为什么?
Why?

278
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,043
那你就要自己去问 Sawyer 了
You're gonna have to ask Sawyer.

279
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:20,014
-Kate 你去哪儿?  -我不在乎Jack说什么
-Kate, where are you going?  -I don't care what Jack said.

280
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:24,014
我们必须把他找回来 我欠他的...
They've got him, and we have to get him back.I owe him that...

281
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,048
我要去找人帮忙
so I'm going to get help.

282
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,053
找谁?
Help from who?

283
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,032
那真是个精品啊
Now that's a hell of a Jesus.

284
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:41,048
Hugo 是个好儿子
Yes. Hugo is such a good son.

285
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,080
他知道我们的爱 来自耶稣基督
He knows of my love for the savior,

286
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:51,033
所以他委托 Taxco 的艺术家为我雕刻这尊纯金的雕像
so he commissioned artisans in taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold.

287
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:55,021
这闻起来像意大利面
Wow, that smells like great lasagna.

288
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:57,080
这是 Trons 一家自制的
The Trons made it themselves.

289
00:20:57,081 --> 00:21:00,047
Hugo在Bennigan 找到他们的
Hugo found them in Bennigan'S.

290
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:03,077
现在他们是我们的管家
Now they are our butlers.

291
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:07,023
有什么不对吗 Hugo?
Something wrong, Hugo?

292
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:10,048
你父亲问你问题呢 Hugo
Your father asked you a question, Hugo.

293
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,074
我父亲?
My father?

294
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,098
好像他从来都没离开过
You're acting like he never left us,

295
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,024
都17年了
like he hasn't been gone for 17 years.

296
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,070
他就这么突然出现了?
And all of a sudden he shows up?

297
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:20,082
你难道就没有怀疑吗?
Aren't you at least a little suspicious?

298
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:24,037
我来是因为你母亲打电话 和我说你遇到了麻烦
I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble.

299
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:25,029
什么?!
What?!

300
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,008
那些数字和诅咒
All these numbers and curs.

301
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:30,008
Hugo 我已经无能为力了
Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore.

302
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:32,054
你需要你父亲的影响
I thought you needed a manly influence,

303
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:35,030
他能帮你摆脱这一切
a father to get you to stop this nonsense.

304
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:36,046
我没有疯!
I'm not crazy!

305
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:39,076
他回来的唯一原因就是为了钱
And the only reason he's back is 'cause he wants the money.

306
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:40,088
这可真伤我的心
Oh, now that hurts.

307
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:43,097
那么好! 谁都拿不到钱!
Well, guess what?There isn't gonna be any money.

308
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:46,014
Tron 先生 Tron 女士
Ha! Mr. Tron, lady Tron.

309
00:21:46,015 --> 00:21:48,035
我们不需要你们的服务了
Your services will no longer be needed.

310
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:49,089
这是解雇费
Severance.

311
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,056
相信我 我是在帮你们
Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor.

312
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:54,044
你们受到诅咒也只是时间问题
It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you,

313
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:57,003
然后你们...死或许更惨
and you...  die, or worse.

314
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:59,007
Hugo 你在干嘛?
Hugo, what are you doing?

315
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,065
摆脱一切...
Getting rid of it, all of it...

316
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:03,045
钱 房子和家畜...
the money,the houses, the livestock...

317
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:04,062
而且我要从他开始
and I'm starting with him.

318
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:06,074
不 Hugo 你父亲要待下来
No, Hugo.Your father is staying with us.

319
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,025
和我们一起住?
Staying with us? Where?

320
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:12,030
已经17年了 Hugo
It's been 17 years, Hugo.

321
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,056
什么17年了?
What's been 17 years?

322
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:22,019
我也是有需求的
I have needs.

323
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:27,069
不不不! 这都不是真的!
No, no, no!This can't be happening!

324
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,007
他必须要走! 我要他离开!
He has to go! He has to!I want him gone!

325
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,094
-不 你不想  -是的 他要走
-No, you don't.  -Yeah, I do.

326
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:36,033
你为什么不给你父亲看 你车库里的东西呢 Hugo?
Why don't you show your father what you have in the garage, Hugo?

327
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,051
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

328
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:53,072
你一直留着它
You saved it.

329
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:58,027
你一直留着它
you saved it.

330
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,088
我先 滚开
me first now. Come on.

331
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,049
这些回收物都怎么了?
What's up with all this recycling?

332
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,067
我也不知道 伙计
you got me, dude.

333
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,080
看来那些达摩疯子在建什么路
Looks like those dharma freaks were building some sort of dirt road.

334
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:35,046
这才是我说的
Whoo! Ha ha! Now we're talkin'.

335
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,048
Hugo...

336
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:41,018
对我来说很好
looks good to me.

337
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,072
引擎没坏 是吗?
Engine's fine, right?

338
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:46,043
该死...这里怎么有个人头?
Son of...what's a head doing back here?

339
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:49,003
那是 Roger
Oh, that's just Roger.

340
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:52,099
我要把它发动了!
I'm gonna start the car now!

341
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:59,074
即使你在说英语
dude, even if you were speaking english

342
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:01,078
我还是一个字都听不懂
I wouldn't understand a word you're saying.

343
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,096
放松 这能行的
Just relax. We're good. This'll work.

344
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:11,058
我有希望

345
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,076
这能行的
This will work.

346
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:27,048
该死的
damn it.

347
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:37,032
这又臭又跑了气
It's flat, and it stinks.

348
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,049
你能修好吗? 你知道哪里坏了?
Can you get it to work?Do you know what's wrong?

349
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,003
冷静点 让他专心干活
Chill out. Let the man do his thing.

350
00:24:41,004 --> 00:24:44,058
那啤酒自从 "Rocky III" 就一直放在那儿了
Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before "Rocky III"

351
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,054
也许是"II" 那东西都有毒了 
maybe even "ii". It's probably poison by now.

352
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:49,066
这具骷髅似乎很喜欢
Skeletor seems to like it.

353
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:50,067
干杯
Bottoms up.

354
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,008
这不好笑 伙计
That's not cool, dude.

355
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:55,071
他也有妈妈 家庭和朋友
That guy had a mom, a family and friends.

356
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:59,092
还有名字 不是骷髅... 他叫 Roger Workman
Oh, and a name.Not skeletor... it's Roger Workman.

357
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:04,039
是工人 你个白痴 这是他的工作
It's work man, you blockhead.That's his job.

358
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,014
他是达摩组织的看守
He was a dharma janitor.

359
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:09,028
那你也要尊重死者
Yeah, well you should still respect the dead.

360
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:13,069
你能修好吗?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.Can you fix it?

361
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,045
不 修不好了
No. No fix.

362
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:22,091
但你必须得修好
but you have to.

363
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:25,070
你就不能试一下吗? 我们要让它跑起来
I mean, can't you try, dude?I mean, we gotta get this running.

364
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:29,004
你别说了 他是对的 他说了"修不好的"
Hey, leave the man alone.He's right. "No fix".

365
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:32,008
看看这 它根本跑不起来
" Take a look at that mess.There's no way it's gonna get running.

366
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:34,063
-你多傻啊?  -你有问题吗 伙计?
-How thick are you?  -What's your problem, man?

367
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:36,038
你为什么不希望它能跑起来?
Why--why don't you want this to work?

368
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:39,009
我才不关心 他对你这么重要?
I don't care if it works.Why is it so important to you?

369
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,001
因为我们都要有点希望
Because we could all use a little hope.

370
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:42,076
如果你在寻求希望的话 Ese
If it's hope you're looking for

371
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:45,015
我们在另一个岛上...
you're on the wrong damn island.

372
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:48,044
所以这里根本没什么希望
'cause there sure as hell ain't no hope here.

373
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:03,055
Hugo 该起床了
Come on, Hugo, time to get up.

374

-what's with the earphones?  -It's for the noise.

376

If it doesn't work,you can go to Australia.I won't stop you. Okay?

382
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:33,067
去干什么?
What one thing?

383
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:36,072
我们要打破诅咒
We're gonna break the curse.

384
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:42,023
-这太愚蠢了  -就给她一次机会吧
-This is stupid.  -Just give her a chance, man.

你最近发了一笔大财
You've recently come into a great deal of money.

387

但可以被除掉

那个诅咒在你的体内
A curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you

407
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:23,087
必须得除掉它

408
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:32,088
