So you can hold him for the very first time.

141
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:14,088
我...
I...

142
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,030
我做不到
I can't do this.

143
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:18,042
我...
I...

144
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:21,001
对不起  我做不到
I'm sorry. I can't!

145
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:32,049
我该和谁商量领养的事情
So who do I talk to about adoption?

146
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:35,031
这儿禁止吸烟  Locke太太
You can't smoke in here, mrs. locke.

147
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,002
当然
Oh. of course.

148
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:43,020
抱歉
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:48,050
他是孩子的父亲吗
Is that the father?

150
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:51,069
我...
I, uh...

151
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,060
我不认识他
I don't know who that is.

152
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,090
我能问些问题吗
Can I ask you somethin'?

153
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:09,008
问吧
Sure.

154
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,087
伙计  我为什么跟你们来?
Why am I here, man?

155
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,087
你来  是因为你能看见那个小屋
You're here because you can see the cabin,

156
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,092
正是这样证明了你也很独特
And that makes you special.

157
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:20,011
我有个理论
Well, I have a theory

158
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,070
关于为什么只有我们才能看见它  我洗耳恭听
As to why we're the only ones who can see it. I'd love to hear it.

159
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,089
我想我们能看到它是因为我们都是疯子
I think we can see it cause we're the craziest.

160
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:32,004
你怎么知道它现在具体在哪了  伙计
So how'd you figure out where it was, dude?

161
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:35,051
我还不知道  我们不去小木屋
I didn't. we're not going to the cabin.

162
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:37,039
我们先去土坑那里
We're gonna make a pit stop first.

163
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:40,024
土坑?  在哪儿?
Pit stop? where?

164
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:44,030
Hugo  你就不奇怪达摩组织的那些人怎么了吗
You ever wonder what happened to the dharma initiative, hugo?

165
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:48,049
这儿起码应该有上百号人
There must have been at least a hundred of 'em

166
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:50,004
生活在这岛上
Living on this island--

167
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,093
操控站台  修建房屋
Manning the stations, building those homes,

168
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:55,040
做那些你喜欢的农场服装
Making all that ranch dressing that you like.

169
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:58,035
但是有一天  他们突然都消失了
And then one day, they're all gone.

170
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:59,072
就从此消声匿迹了
They just disappeared.

171
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,090
你想知道我们要去哪?
You want to know where we're going?

172
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:11,073
我们来这他们
We're going to see them.

173
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,017
这里发生了什么
What happened to 'em?

174
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,021
他的杰作
He did.

175
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:42,013
-你好  -无聊的游戏
Hello! that game's stupid.

176
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:43,084
他在这  进来吧
He's right in here. come on in.

177
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:48,097
Melissa  住手!  过来
Melissa, stop that! come on now.

178
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:50,036
带你弟弟到厨房去
Take your brother in the kitchen.

179
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:52,040
有人想见见John
There's someone here who wants to see john.

180
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,052
雨下得可真大啊  简直就是瓢泼大雨
It is coming down like cats and dogs out there.

181
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:59,074
这位好心人想和你谈谈  John
This nice gentleman wants to talk to you, john.

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,090
你得好好表现  知道了吗
So I want you on your best behavior. understand?

183
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,092
你请吧
He's all yours.

184
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,041
你喜欢下西洋双陆棋?
You like backgammon?

185
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:14,031
是吗
Yeah?

186
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,078
看来你对棋的品位还不错
You seem to have a pretty good sense of the game.

187
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,012
john  我叫Richard
I'm richard, john.

188
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:26,023
我开了一个学校...
I run a school for kids who are...

189
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,049
专为特别儿童建立的
Extremely special,

190
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,097
我有理由相信你也是一个比较特别的孩子
And I have reason to believe that you might be one of them.

191
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,038
介意我给你看一些小东西吗
Mind if I show you a couple of really neat things?

192
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:53,007
是你画的吗  john
Did you draw that, john?

193
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:09,008
我想你看一下这些东西
I want you to look at these things...

194
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:15,050
然后想一想
And think about 'em.

195
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,036
好了  john  现在告诉我
Okay, now tell me, john,

196
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:41,018
哪样物品是属于你的?
Which of these things belong to you?

197
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,069
给我的吗
T-to keep?

198
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:47,079
不  不是  John
No, no, john.

199
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,065
哪样物品是已经属于你的了?
Which of these things belong to you already?

200
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:59,046
John  你确定是刀子吗
Are you sure the knife belongs to you, john?

201
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:00,066
确定吗
You sure about that?

202
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:08,039
事实是  他不属于你
Well, it doesn't.

203
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,060
他表现怎样
How did he do?

204
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:21,036
恐怕John不适合我的学校
I'm afraid john isn't quite ready for our school.

205
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:23,007
抱歉打扰了
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.

206
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,064
你到底做了些什么
What did you do?

207
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,036
他在下面干什么呢
What's he doing down there?

208
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:49,043
那...
So...

209
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:53,004
你就是在这朝Locke开枪  让他自生自灭的地方?
This is where you shot locke and left him for dead, huh?

210
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:56,054
是的  Hugo  我扣扳机时
Yes, hugo, I was standing right where you are now

211
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,027
正好站在你现在的位置上
When I pulled the trigger.

212
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:04,091
当时应该发觉到这些都是没有意义的
Should have realized at the time that it was pointless,

213
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:07,058
但是...  我当时确实头脑不清醒
But... I really wasn't thinking clearly.

214
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,099
也是因为这个原因你杀死了这些人的吗
Is that why you killed all these people, too?

215
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:15,016
不是我杀的
I didn't kill them.

216
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:18,021
如果不是"其他人"铲除达摩组织的
Well, if the others didn't wipe out the dharma initiative--

217
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:20,004
是"其他人"把他们给铲除的  Hugo
They did wipe them out, hugo,

218
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:22,079
但是这不是我的决定
But it wasn't my decision.

219
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:25,040
那又会是谁的呢
Then whose was it?

220
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:27,001
他们首领的
Their leader's.

221
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:29,099
但是我以为你就是他们的首领
But I thought you were their leader.

222
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:33,018
不常是
Not always.

223
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:54,025
小木屋
The cabin?

224
00:17:55,017 --> 00:17:56,061
他当时在建这个小木屋
He was building it.

225
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:58,068
你找到想要的了吗
Did you find what you were looking for?

226
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,057
是的  Hugo  我想我找到了
Yes, hugo. I believe I did.

227
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:09,017
钥匙给我
I need your key.

228
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,057
什么?
What?

229
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:11,051
船长
Captain.

230
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:15,005
Mayhew刚才死了  医生也无能为力 
Mayhew just died. doc couldn't do anything for him.

231
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:16,075
船员们都在猜想
The crew's asking a lot of questions

232
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,036
你们在岛上发生了什么事
About what happened to you guys over there.

233
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:20,002
你告诉船员们我自会处理
You tell the crew that I'm dealing with it.

234
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:22,078
Frank  你可以走了  去给直升机加满燃料
Then you can go gas up the chopper, frank.

235
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:25,098
-我们要回岛上去  -回去?  为什么?
We're going back. going back? what the hell for?

236
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:27,050
只管去加燃料  Frank
Gas up the chopper, frank.

237
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,051
那好吧
Okay.

238
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:35,030
听着  Martin
Listen, martin.

239
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:38,073
你走后  这又出现了病例
While you were gone, there was some sort of a sickness. mm-hmm.

240
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:39,061
船员们
The crew--

241
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:41,051
他们的行为举止都很奇怪
They've been exhibiting some very strange behavior.

242
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:43,051
Regina自己无故跳到大海里去了
Regina threw herself overboard, for god sake.

243
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:45,006
如果我不说出来
Now I would be derelict in my duty

244
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,015
因为或许你也染上了这种病
That this might be exactly what's happening to you.

245
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,025
感谢你的关心
I appreciate your concern.

246
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,039
钥匙给我
Give me your key.

247
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:57,066
协议不允许我...
That's not the protocol--

248
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,056
谢谢
Thank you.

249
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:10,020
这有两把钥匙的原因
The reason there are two keys

250
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,048
是要我们一起打开保险箱的
Is we're only supposed to open the safe together.

251
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:14,036
你是在这  不是吗
You're here, aren't you?

252
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:18,084
那是什么
What is that?

253
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:20,064
是中级协议
It's the secondary protocol.

254
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:26,003
上面有什么?
What does it say?

255
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:27,079
告诉我们Linus的去向
It says where linus is going.

256
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,090
Widmore怎么知道的
How would mr. widmore know that?

257
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:32,058
因为他是个聪明人
Cause he's a very smart man,

258
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:35,061
Linus知道我们要把这岛给烧了
And if linus knows that we're gonna torch the island,

259
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,065
他只有一个地方可以去
There's only one place that he can go.

260
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:41,052
你什么意思  烧毁这岛?
What do you mean, "torch the island"?

261
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:42,095
这不在协议上
That was not the agreement.

262
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:45,053
我是答应载你去执行撤退任务
I agreed to ferry you here for an extraction mission.

263
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:52,026
把我的枪修好
Fix my gun.

264
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:05,015
这个人
The injured man...

265
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:07,069
根本不是枪伤
There was no gunshot.

266
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,059
你认为发生了什么
What do you think happened to him?

267
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:15,081
我不知道  但是当他们再去的时候
I don't know. but when they go back,

268
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:19,030
-他们会确保不会再发生此事  -Omar
They'll be certain it doesn't happen again. omar!

269
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,054
Keamy要你去武器库
Keamy wants you in the armory.

270
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,002
他叫我死盯这两个人
He said I wasn't supposed to let those two out of my sight.

271
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,068
我来守  去吧
I'll watch them. go.

272
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,027
厨房下面有个储藏室
There's a pantry below our galley

273
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:41,070
足够容下你们两位
With enough room for two men.

274
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:44,041
我给你们留下了食物和水  你们得去那
I've left you a supply of food and water. you need to go there.

275
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:45,083
Michael  死了吗
Michael--is he dead?

276
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:48,048
没有  不过也差不多了  正因为如此
No, but not for lack of bloody trying, which is precisely why

277
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:51,034
你们得赶在Keamy回来前藏起来
You two need to be hiding before keamy comes back on this deck.

278
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:54,096
藏起来是没用的  把救生船给我们
Hiding is pointless. give us your zodiac raft

279
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:57,084
这样我们就能把岛上的人载回来
So we can start ferrying people back here from the beach.

280
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,095
救我们的唯一办法
The only way to save our lives

281
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:03,051
是要把我们的人带离那座岛
Is to get our people off that island.

282
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:09,046
十分钟在货柜后面来见我
Meet me behind the container in ten minutes.

283
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:12,041
船会给你们送上
The boat will be in the water.

284
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:19,057
小木屋在这
Cabin's here.

285
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:23,034
我从这里来  海滩这里
I came from over there. up the coast.

286
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,021
给
Here you go.

287
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,056
喝点水吧  伙计
Drink up, dude.

288
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:32,073
在一堆乱尸翻了半天  渴死了吧
Digging through dead bodies takes it out of you.

289
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:35,043
天一会就黑了  Hugo
It's gonna be dark soon, hugo.

290
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,061
如果你朝那个方向走
If you head that way,

291
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,037
你就会到达海滩  你要做的就是
You'll hit the coast, and all you have to do

292
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:43,083
-一路向北  -你说什么  
Is take it north until you reach our beach. uh, what?

293
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:46,060
我用枪逼你和我们一起  是我不对  Hugo
I forced you to come with us at gunpoint, and I'm sorry, hugo,

294
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:50,005
但是我相信  你能帮我们找到这
But I was led to believe that we needed you to find this place.

295
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:51,096
我明白了  现在你有地图了
Oh, I get it. now you got your magic map,

296
00:21:51,096 --> 00:21:55,027
-你  你用不到我了  -我这是给你个机会脱身
You don't-- you don't need me anymore. I'm offering you a chance to leave.

297
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:59,044
我不想逼你做不情愿的而且相当危险的事
I don't want to put you in harm's way against your will.

298
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,053
那么你觉得我孤身一人
And you think walking through the jungle

299
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:03,039
-在晚上穿越丛林更加安全?  -我看未必
At night by myself is gonna be any safer? I'm not sure it is.

300
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:06,092
我想我会和你们一起
I think I'll stick with you guys.

301
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,005
这边吗?
This way?

302
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,016
怎么了?
What?

303
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:18,096
他现在心甘情愿留下了
He actually thinks staying was his idea.

304
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,025
真行啊  John  你真行啊
Not bad, john. not bad at all.

305
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:26,069
我和你不一样
I'm not you.

306
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:32,008
当然不一样
You're certainly not.

307
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,099
放我出去  请放我出去
Somebody, let me out! please let me out.

308
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:45,051
求求你们  放我...
Please, somebody, let me--

309
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,074
John  你没事吧
John, you okay?

310
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:49,047
我很好  我很好
I'm fine. I'm fine.

311
00:22:50,072 --> 00:22:53,026
去上课吧  女孩们  上课铃响了

我们去医务室
Let's go to the nurse's office.

314
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:03,054
你想说说怎么回事吗?
You wanna talk about it?

315
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:05,053
不
No.

316

我知道你很不爽

328
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,024
是的

329

你不知道像科学夏令营这样的东西
Don't you understand that things like science camp

330
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:45,077
是让我被锁起来的原因

331
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:48,034
-john 这是千载难逢的机会  -他们怎么知道我的?
John, this is a great opportunity. how do they even know about me?

332
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:50,041
他们派了代表参加科学博览会

我不是科学家

我喜欢拳击  钓鱼和汽车

338
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:06,056
像你这么大时  我多想有人能告诉我
Something I wish someone had told me at your age.

339
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,010
你可能不想在实验室过一辈子
You might not want to be that guy in the labs

340
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,089
整天和试管  烧杯打交道
Surrounded by test tubes and beakers,

341
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:15,017
但是那就是你的宿命  John
But that's who you are, john.

342
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:19,030
你当不了舞会王子
You can't be the prom king.

343

你不能成为四分卫

你成不了超级英雄

345
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,000
别对我说  我不能做什么
Don't tell me what I can't do.

346
00:24:48,002 --> 00:24:49,022
为什么你不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

347
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,025
告诉你什么?
Tell you what?

348
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,021
你是815航班的幸存者
That you're a survivor of 815.

349
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,035
因为你不会相信我
Aah! 'cause you wouldn't have believed me.

350
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,011
你认为我不会相信你?
You didn't think I'd believe you?

351
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:01,058
我告诉你  我是这个世界上唯一
I tell you that I'm one of the only people in the world

352
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,085
认为那架在海底的飞机残骸

354
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:07,035
-你还认为我不会相信你?  -我不知道我能否信任你  
And you didn't think I'd believe you? I didn't know if I could trust you.

355
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:09,002
是你老板把那假的飞机弄到海底的
Your boss put that plane there.

356
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:13,004
伙计  我也以为我是他们的同伙
Man, I thought I was mr. conspiracy,

357
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:14,039
不过明白我的意思了吧
But you got me beat there.

358
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:19,025
听我说  听我说
Listen to me. listen to me.

359
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,080
你不能把那些人送回去  keamy
You can't fly that guy back--keamy.

360
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,043
-让我来应付keamy吧  好吗?  -你不能把他带回去
You let me worry about keamy, all right? you can't fly him back!

361
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:27,036
他会杀掉岛上的所有人
He is gonna kill everyone on that island.

362
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:28,054
所有人
Everyone.

363
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:32,088
你的良心不会让它发生  伙计
And you don't want that on your conscience, man.

364
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:34,010
相信我
Trust me.

365
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:54,037
我刚好要把他带到驾驶仓

366
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,096
朝305方位前进

367
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:09,083
Faraday说  只有这条路是安全的

What will you tell keamy if he notices the zodiac is missing?

369
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:15,029
我会告诉他  是你偷了  走吧
I'll tell him you stole it. now go.

370
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:24,075

371
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:27,068
-我不能和你一起走  -为什么不?  
I can't go with you. why not?

372
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:30,030
我在那个岛上三年了
I've been on that island for three years.

373
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,092
我再也不要踏上那个小岛了
I'm never setting foot on it again...

374
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:35,077
penny正在找我  我更不能回去
Not when penny's coming for me.

375
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:41,080
我会随第一组尽早回来
I'll be back with the first group as soon as I can.

376
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:45,024
径直往那个方向去  知道了吗?
Stay on that bearing, yeah?

377
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,001
我会的
I will.

378
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:49,022
你得走了
You need to go now.

379
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,092
从这走约200码
It should be about 200 yards this way.

380
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:23,003
你确定在那边吗  John?
You sure it's gonna be there, john?

381
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:25,055
什么?
I'm sorry?

382
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:28,005
那个木屋  如果搬走了  怎么办?
The cabin-- what if it's moved again?

383
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,013
不会的
It hasn't moved

384
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:32,033
因为我所知道的  就是在那
Because I was told that this is where it would be.

385
00:27:33,022 --> 00:27:35,004
我也被告知很多事情
I was told a lot of things, too--

386
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:37,048
我是被选中的  我和你们不一样
That I was chosen, that I was special.

387
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:39,071
结果我的脊骨上却长了个瘤
I end up with a tumor on my spine

388
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:42,022
我的双手沾满了我女儿的血
And my daughter's blood all over my hands.

389
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:46,080
Ben  我对发生的一切感到抱歉
I'm sorry those things happened to you, ben.

390
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,018
那些事情注定要发生的
Those things had to happen to me.

391
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:53,040
那是我的宿命
That was my destiny.

392
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:56,094
你很快就会明白了
But you'll understand soon enough

393
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:59,041
被选中是需要付出代价的...
That there are consequences to being chosen...

394
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,038
John  因为  命运  
Because, destiny, john,

395
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:06,069
是个薄情的婊子
Is a fickle bitch.

396
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:11,028
伙计们
Guys?

397
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:15,027
木屋
Cabin.

398
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:51,005
好的  好的  好的  干得好  伙计
Okay, okay, okay. good job, man.

399
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:53,040
干得好  John  好了  我们明天继续
Good job, john. okay, we'll try it some more tomorrow.

400
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,054
他是你的了  起来吧
He's all yours. come on up.

401
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,081
好了  来吧
It's all right. come on.

402
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:05,023
别放弃  Locke先生
Don't give up, mr. locke.

403
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,005
你说什么?
Excuse me?

404
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,014
我说  别放弃
I'm just saying, don't give up.

405
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:11,038
凡事皆有可能
Anything's possible.

406
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,042
你应该去看看我的档案
You should read my file.

407
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:18,034
我的脊柱粉碎了
My spine was crushed.

408
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,034
双脚不能恢复知觉的可能性高达98%
There's a 98% chance I'll never get any feeling back in my legs.

409
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,081
所以我想不通  为什么我还在尝试
So I don't know why I'm even trying to--

410
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:26,053
实际上  我已经读过你的档案
As a matter of fact, I did read your file.

411
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:29,095
你从八层楼摔下  却得以幸存
You survived falling eight stories out of a building.

412
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:33,090
这已经是个奇迹  Locke先生
That's a miracle, mr. locke.

413
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,036
让我来问你
Let me ask you something.

414
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:43,058
你相信奇迹吗?
Do you believe in miracles?

415
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:47,014
不  我不相信
No. I don't believe in miracles.

416
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,067
你应该相信
You should.

417
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:51,072
我身上就发生过一个
I had one happen to me.

418
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:00,069
听着  我只想回我的房间
Hey, look. I just want to go back to my room.

419
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,028
你知道你需要什么吗 locke先生?
You know what you need, mr. locke?

420
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,064
你需要来次徒步旅行
You need to go on a walkabout.

421
00:30:16,095 --> 00:30:18,091
什么是徒步旅行
Wha-what's a walkabout?

422
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:21,056
那是个自我发现的旅程
It's a journey of self-discovery.

423
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,096
你要深入澳大利亚的腹地
You go out into the australian outback

424
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:27,068
除了刀子和你的智慧  什么也不要带
With nothing more than a knife and your wits.

425
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:31,010
徒步旅行什么的  我做不到
I can't "walkabout" anything.

426
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:34,028
我是个瘸子  要是你还没看出来的话
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a cripple.

427
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:38,011
你真的是这样而已吗  locke先生？
Is that what you are, mr. locke?

428
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,070
徒步旅行前我是一个普通的人
I went on my walkabout convinced I was one thing,

429
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:44,048
回来的时候成了另外一个人
But I came back another.

430
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:48,014
我发现了我的本质  发现我是谁
I found out what I was made of, who I was.

431
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:50,012
看看你现在 
And here you are,

432
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,078
一个勤务员
An orderly.

433
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,078
John  我不只是个勤务员
Oh, I'm a lot more than just an orderly, john.

434
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,075
当你准备好了  locke先生
When you're ready, mr. locke...

435
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,095
你就会相信我所说的
You'll listen to what I'm saying.

436
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,055
要是碰巧再次见面...
And then when you and me run into each other again...

437
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:26,031
你就欠我一个人情
You'll owe me one.

438
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,088
医生
Hey, doc.

439
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:53,047
有些不可思议的事  有没兴趣听听?
Wanna hear something weird?

440
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:56,035
当然
Yeah, sure.

441
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:59,042
你知道我从海滩上获得的摩尔斯密码吗
You know that morse code message that I got from the beach?

442
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:01,073
密码说医生死了  被冲上了岸边
It said that the doctor washed up on the shore

443
00:32:01,073 --> 00:32:03,027
喉咙被切开了
With his throat slit.

444
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,017
可我不是还好好的吗
But I'm the doctor.

445
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,032
很荒唐  对吧?
Crazy, right?

446
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:10,049
所有的都在这了吗?
Everything here?

447
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,018
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

448
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:13,057
好  把它装好
Good. get it packed up.

449
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:21,008
把这些都搬出来  准备干嘛呢
What are you gonna do with all that?

450
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:24,009
发动直升机  Frank
Fire her up, frank.

451
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:29,004
Mr. Keamy  我是受雇来运送科学家的
Mr. keamy, I was hired to fly scientists.

452
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:33,039
滚到机舱去把直升机发动起来  Frank
Get your ass in the cockpit and fire up the chopper, frank.

453
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,046
我不会载你去的
I'm not taking you.

454
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:45,000
-我会杀了你的  Frank  -是吗  那就杀吧
I'll kill you, frank. yeah, well, you do that,

455
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,038
但你永远都不可能再回到岛上了
You'll never get back to the island

456
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,011
因为这里只有我一个飞行员
Cause I'm the only pilot you got.

457
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:58,057
抱歉  医生
Sorry, doc.

458
00:33:06,064 --> 00:33:08,085
改变主意了吗  Frank?
That change anything, frank? huh?

459
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:11,089
再过三十秒  就轮到下个倒霉鬼了
Another 30 seconds goes by and someone else's turn--

460
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:17,022
你的枪我修好了
I fixed your gun.

461
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,060
往后站  martin  不然我就开枪了
Now stand down, martin, or I will fire.

462
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:36,002
你不会这么做的  船长
I don't think you want to do that, captain.

463
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,031
他手臂上绑着什么
What's that on his arm?

464
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:40,049
他手臂上绑着什么
What's that on his arm?

465
00:33:55,022 --> 00:33:56,069
决定的怎么样了?  Frank?
What'll it be, frank?

466
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,081
我们去
We're flying.

467
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:08,020
快点  出发了  小伙子们  快
Come on. let's go, boys. come on!

468
00:34:08,034 --> 00:34:11,000
把剩下的武器都搬上去  出发  出发
Get the rest of the weapons onboard, and let's go. let's go!

469
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,037
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

470
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:13,074
出发
Let's move out.

471
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:31,099
谢谢  船长
Thanks, captain.

472
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:38,035
快  快  快  出发
Come on! come on! come on! come on! let's go!

473
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:13,055
我跟你怎么说来着
What did I say to you?

474
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,020
你叫我别离开帐篷
You told me not to leave my tent.

475
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:18,062
我饿了
I was hungry.

476
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:21,076
Jack  你得好好休息  你不能再到处乱跑了
Jack, you have to rest. you can't run around.

477
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,031
我知道你不好意思开口
I know that it is hard for you to ask for help,

478
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,052
但要是你把缝线拆了
But if you tear your stitches...

479
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:28,037
行了  行了  我知道了
Okay. okay. I got it.

480
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:31,003
医生是最难对付的病人
Doctors make the worst patients.

481
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,055
Jack!
Jack!

482
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,065
我想他们是叫我们跟过去
I think they want us to follow 'em.

483
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:04,041
好了  我们进去吧
All right. let's do this.

484
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,056
那里面  我就不去了
I'm not going in there with you.

485
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,039
什么
What?

486
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:10,066
这个小岛要我病倒
The island wanted me to get sick,

487
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,071
它要你恢复健康
And it wanted you to get well.

488
00:37:14,076 --> 00:37:16,056
我的时代结束了  John
My time is over, john.

489
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:19,074
你的时代到来了
It's yours now.

490
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:25,076
你要是一个人进去  我也没有意见
Yeah, I'm cool with you going in alone, too.

491
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:37,026
祝你好运  John
Good luck, john.

492
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:41,075
你是Jacob?
Are you jacob?

493
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:49,069
但我可以代表他说话
But I can speak on his behalf.

494
00:38:59,097 --> 00:39:01,008
那  你是谁
Well, who are you?

495
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:06,004
我叫Christian
I'm christian.

496
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:29,005
你知道我为什么来这吗
You know why I'm here?

497
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,001
当然
Yeah, sure.

498
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:35,001
你自己知道吗
Do you?

499
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:41,047
我来这...
I'm here...

500
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:45,067
是因为我是被选中的
Because I was chosen to be.

501
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:52,047
确实如此
That's absolutely right.

502
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:05,087
Claire?
Claire?

503
00:40:07,017 --> 00:40:08,031
嗨  John
Hi, john.

504
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:11,009
你怎么在这里
What are you doing here?

505
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:13,059
别担心  我跟着他  好着呢  
Don't worry. I'm fine. I'm with him.

506
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:18,058
孩子呢
Where's the baby?

507
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:20,061
孩子待在他该待的地方
The baby's where he's supposed to be,

508
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:22,018
不过不在这
And that's not here.

509
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:25,043
你最好
It's probably best

510
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:28,068
不要跟别人说  她在这
That you don't tell anyone that you saw her.

511
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:31,041
-为什么  为什么她  -我们没时间聊这些了 
Why? why is she-- we don't have time for this.

512
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:35,021
船上的人已经在回来的路上了
The people from the boat are already on their way back,

513
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,091
一旦他们抵达这
And once they get here,

514
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:39,019
所有的问题都会变得毫无意义
All of these questions won't matter one bit.

515
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,063
那你怎么不问个有意义的问题
So why don't you ask the one question that does matter?

516
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,007
我该怎么拯救岛上的人
How do I save the island?

517
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,024
他告诉你   我们该怎么做了吗
Did he tell you what we're supposed to do?

518
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:21,078
他要我们离开这里
He wants us to move the island.

519
00:42:26,066 --> 00:43:21,033
