1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,025
前情提要
Previously on Lost

2
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:08,005
你杀了Naomi
You killed Naomi

3
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:10,015
她想让她的人到岛上来
She want's her people to come here

4
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:11,055
相信我  我们得赶在
and trust me, when they do

5
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:13,082
他们到之前离开这儿
We had better be far away from here.

6
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:17,005
要想活命就跟我来
If you want to live,you need to come with me.

7
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:28,019
你是谁?
Who are you?

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,059
-Daniel Faraday  我是来救你们的  -就这些人吗?
Daniel faraday. I'm here to rescue you. so this is the team?

9
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,059
他们不合适参加这种任务
These are the wrong people for a mission like this.

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,013
无实战经验  没受过军事训练
None of them have field experience,military training.

11
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:38,024
不能置他们于危险而不顾
You can't just drop them in unprotected.

12
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:40,003
我尽力而为吧
There's only so much I can do.

13
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:41,076
直升机坠毁在哪?
Where's the chopper? where did it crash?

14
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:44,003
坠毁?  你当我菜鸟啊?
crash?what kind of pilot you think I am?

15
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:46,047
我把它好好的藏起来了  就在那儿
I put her down safe and sound right over there.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,002
起来  跟我们走
Get up. you're coming with us. well,

17
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,030
我们得留在这儿  这样他们才找得到我们
we need to stay where we are so that they can find us.

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,060
你错了  我们不想被别人发现
See,there's your problem. we don't want to be found.

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,040
你想知道我为何到这来吗?
You wanted to know why we're here?

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,090
直说了吧  我们是来找Benjamin Linus的
I'll tell you why we're here. we're here for benjamin linus.

21
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:01,007
他现在在哪儿?
Now where is he?

22
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:23,008
Ben之前有提到
Did ben ever mention anything

23
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,042
有人离开过这岛的事情吗?
About knowing anyone off the island?

24
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,055
-你确定吗?  -没有
You're sure of that? no.

25
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:26,055
听着  事情很简单
Look,this is real simple.

26
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,062
你知不知道他在哪儿?
Do you know where he is or don't you?

27
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:32,049
-你找他干嘛?  -我想知道他的位置
What do you want with him? I wanna locate him.

28
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,086
我的雇主只告诉我他叫Benjamin Linus
The people who hired me told me his name's benjamin linus.

29
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:36,083
和一张照片  只告诉我这么多
They gave this picture,and that's all they told me.

30
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,056
只吩咐叫我找到他  然后拿钱
They said,"find him." and for what they're paying me,

31
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:42,023
其它我都不关心
I don't need to know anything else.

32
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:44,079
你知道么?
Do you?

33
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:47,016
你找Ben?
You want ben?

34
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,066
好吧  他和你的朋友还有Locke在一起
Okay,he's with locke and your friend...

35
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,023
-Charlotte  -Charlotte
Charlotte. charlotte.

36
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:53,099
Locke也抓住了她  我们知道他往哪去
Locke's got her,too,and we know where he's heading.

37
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,039
Locke是杀了Naomi的那厮吗?
Locke's the guy that killed naomi?

38
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:58,083
Shephard把枪还给我
Give me back my gun,shephard.

39
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:01,073
想要枪  先回答我的问题
You want your gun back. I want answers.

40
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:03,073
-你不相信我  -我不相信你
You don't trust me. I don't trust you.

41
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:06,073
其实你早该死翘翘了
In fact,you're supposed to be dead.

42
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,083
我之前问过什么了吗?  没有
But am I asking a billion questions? no.

43
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,077
我们都要面对Locke这个大麻烦
We both have the same problem-- this locke guy.

44
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:13,021
就算Locke抓了你的同伴
Even if locke has your friend,

45
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,018
你也不能大摇大摆地去带人走
You can't just waltz in there and grab her.

46
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,031
他们有武装的
They're armed.

47
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:18,027
那又怎样?  我们不也一样吗
Well,how about that? so are we.

48
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:19,027
我们快行动吧
So why don't we move out and--

49
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:22,043
你哪儿也别去  直升机还能飞吗? 
You're not going anywhere. will that helicopter fly?

50
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,073
可以
What she does.

51
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,043
-那就带我去你船上  -Sayid  等等
Then you can take me to your ship. sayid,wait a second.

52
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:32,033
我们说过让他们带我们走  不是吗? 
We did call these people to get us off this island, Didn't we?

53
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,080
怎样?
Well?

54
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,083
来的时候耗油太多了
I burned a lot of fuel coming in.

55
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,045
不能载太多重量
I can't carry much weight.

56
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:39,078
我带你们三人走
I'll take three of ya.

57
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:42,025
你这山羊胡子白日发昏吧?!
In case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee,

58
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,022
别忘了这些乡巴佬还抓了Charlotte呢
One of these yahoos took charlotte prisoner.

59
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:46,039
我能把她安全救出来  
I can bring her back safely.

60
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:52,095
要是我做到了...
And if I do...

61
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:55,078
你会带我上船吗?
Will you take me to the ship?

62
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,015
肯定会
Absolutely.

63
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,041
你把Charlotte安然无恙带回来
You bring charlotte back safe,

64
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,095
我就带你们离开这座小岛
And I will take you off this island.

65
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,091
早上好
Good morning.

66
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,018
早上好
Morning.

67
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,018
距下一个洞还远呢
It's a long walk to the next hole.

68
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,085
要我搭你一程吗?
Do you need a ride?

69
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,031
谢谢  不必了  我的球就在这儿呢
Thank you,but no. my ball is right here.

70
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:40,018
知道吗,你是我见过第一个在这儿晃悠一早上的人
You know, You're the first person I've seen out here all morning.

71
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,018
我想大家为了彼此的私人空间
I believe we're paying quite a premium

72
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,068
都花了不少
For that kind of privacy.

73
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:46,018
确实是这样
Indeed we are.

74
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:51,038
第一次来Seychelles吗?
Is this your first time in the seychelles?

75
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:56,071
是我就用5号杆
Unh-unh. I'd use the 5-iron.

76
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:59,018
我想我还是用7号
I think I'll stick with the 7.

77
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:04,031
这样吧,赌50欧元,5号杆肯定打得更近
Tell you what. 50 euros says mine goes closer to the pin with a 5.

78
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,078
赌100吧
Let's make it 100.

79
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,075
好样的
Eccellente.

80
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:13,001
有意思
Amazing,huh,

81
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:16,055
还有什么能比打赌更有趣的呢?
How a wager makes just about anything more fun?

82
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,081
不赖啊
Not bad.

83
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:35,005
好球
Not bad.

84
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,005
说起来...
So...

85
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:39,078
你是干什么的  朋友?
What do you do for a living,my friend?

86
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:41,075
无所事事
I do nothing.

87
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:44,075
无所事事可付不起这度假费哦
"nothing" doesn't pay for a vacation here.

88
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:48,025
我是大笔赔偿款的受益者
I was the recipient of a large settlement.

89
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,041
公司并购吗?
Corporate merger?

90
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:51,018
准确来说是空难
Actually,a plane crash.

91
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,081
大洋航班815号
Oceanic airlines flight 815.

92
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:58,021
我是Sayid Jarrah
I'm sayid jarrah.

93
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:00,065
大洋6人之一
One of the oceanic six.

94
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:05,058
这...
Ah,that's...

95
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:08,041
这...  这真是奇迹
That's--that's amazing. uh...

96
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:11,058
我记得那段时间常常在报上看到这事
I remember reading all about it.

97
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,048
挥杆吧  朋友
Take your shot,my friend.

98
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,061
看起来你说用5号杆是对的
It appears you were right about the 5 iron.

99
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:35,081
您继续玩吧  赌金的事儿就算了吧
Enjoy you round,and,uh,don't worry about the wager.

100
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,081
玩玩而已嘛
It's all in good fun.

101
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,071
不  你赢了  我愿赌服输
No,you won. allow me to pay you.

102
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,055
没事的  谢谢你  这...
It's fine,thank you. it's...

103
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,008
一定得给您  Avellino先生
I insist,mr. avellino.

这座位有人么?

108
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:53,015
你想去哪里?

109
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:56,068
德语我只会说一句"这座位有人么?"
"is it free?" was the full extent of my german.

110
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:00,051
你在找什么?
What are you looking for?

111
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:03,041
我爱死欧洲了  人人都会说英语
I love europe. everyone speaks english.

112
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,045
我在找波茨坦广场
I'm looking for potsdamer platz.

113
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:07,085
那用不着地图
Well,you don't need a map.

114
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,035
离这就一个街区  过街就是
It's one block down,right across the street.

115
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,062
谢谢
Thank you.

116
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,085
我是Elsa
I'm elsa.

117
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:19,052
Sayid
Sayid.

118
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:24,072
请给我来杯蒸馏咖啡
Could I have an espresso,please?

119
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:28,085
什么风把你吹到柏林来了?
What sort of business brings you to berlin?

120
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:30,085
我是来物色人才的
I'm a headhunter.

121
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,038
帮公司招兵买马
A corporate recruiter.

122
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:38,068
我的老板是个经济学家  他专门研究新兴的市场
My employer is an economist. he works in emerging markets.

123
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:42,045
事实上  我还真不知道他是干什么的
Actually,i-i don't really understand what he does,

124
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:45,088
这也无所谓  因为我只是帮他购物就行了
Which doesn't matter since all I do is shop for him.

125
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:48,081
这玩意一响
And if this goes off,

126
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:51,065
我就得马上出现在他面前
I'm at his side instantly,

127
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:54,031
其实这差事儿很棒 因为他一年只来柏林一两次
Which is wonderful since he's only in berlin once or twice a year.

128
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:58,011
所以你在这里享受 奢侈的午间咖啡
Which is why you're enjoying a luxuriously long midday coffee.

129
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:00,077
是啊
Yes.

130
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,097
谢谢
Thank you.

131
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:20,054
我...
Do i...

132
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:22,094
好像在哪见过你似的
Know you from somewhere?

133
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:26,034
如果你肯跟我去吃晚饭
I'll tell you exactly where you know me from...

134
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,094
我就一五一十地告诉你
If you let me take you to dinner.

135
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:45,087
今晚带我去这个餐馆
This is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight.

136
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,024
八点
8:00.

137
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,081
只要你能找的到
Well... if you can find it.

138
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:09,034
喂
Hello?

139
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:10,084
已经联系上了
I made contact.

140
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:12,021
好的
Good.

141
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,064
看看这个
Take a look at this.

142
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:34,057
Naomi身上的
Naomi had it with her.

143
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,094
她在找Desmond
She was looking for desmond.

144
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,034
不管他们本来的企图是什么
Whatever their real agenda is,

145
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,048
明显他们内部的人都有事互相隐瞒
It's clear they're not sharing it.

146
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,075
也许Desmond能解释这一切
Maybe desmond can shed some light on this.

147
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:50,055
到海滩一去一回要多久?
How long would it take to get to the beach and back?

148
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:53,069
几个小时吧
Couple of hours.

149
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:54,099
要不你去?
You mind?

150
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:57,009
乐意帮忙
Anything I can do to help.

151
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,026
Sayid
Sayid.

152
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:04,062
怎么做?
So how we gonna do this?

153
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,025
这种行动你不合适
You're not the best candidate for this kind of mission.

154
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,032
这是哪种行动?
Well,and what kind of mission is that?

155
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:11,029
我去让Locke放了Charlotte
I'm going to make locke release charlotte,

156
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,059
而且要和平解决
And I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.

157
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:17,003
我去了就得流血吗?
As opposed to the way I'd do it?

158
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:19,000
上次你见到他
The last time you encountered him,

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,093
你用枪指着他的头  还扣了扳机
You put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.

160
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:24,017
这方法可不够好
That's not good diplomacy.

161
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,060
嘿  Jarrah
Hey. jarrah.

162
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:29,020
你想去找Charlotte不带我么?
You think you're going after charlotte without me?

163
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:30,087
当然不是
Of course not.

164
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,097
好的
Well,good.

165
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,023
还有什么事吗?
Is there anything else?

166
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:41,003
有啊  把枪给我
Yeah. give me my gun back.

167
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:44,036
10分钟后出发
We leave in ten minutes.

168
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:52,060
给我们个名字吧  阴谋家
Ready to give us a name,gizmo?

169
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,087
James  他不会告诉你哪个是混进船上的间谍的
He's not gonna tell you who his spy is on their boat,james.

170
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,073
是吗?  为什么不会呢?
Yeah? why not?

171
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:00,027
因为他想活命
Because that's the only thing that's keeping him alive.

172
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,097
我有个主意
Well,here's an idea.

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,047
我们把枪对着他的大脚趾
Why don't we take a gun,point it to his big toe

174
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,047
然后拿到市场上去卖
And send that little piggy to market?

175
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,027
如果他还不就范
And if he still doesn't want to tell us,

176
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,090
我们就来烤肉  这样可以吧
We'll move on to the roast beef. now why don't we do that?

177
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:15,013
那样的话我们就得背上他了
Because then we'd have to carry him.

178
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:38,013
John  还有多远?  我要给Aaron喂奶了
Hey,john,how much further is it? i-i need to feed aaron.

179
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:40,013
应该在这啊...  那个小屋
It should be here... the cabin.

180
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:43,082
可能我们迷路了  根本不在这
Maybe we got turned around. it could be anywhere.

181
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,012
不  肯定是这没错
No,it was here.

182
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:47,079
屋子里有什么东西这么重要?
Well,what's in this cabin that's so important anyway?

183
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,005
John想从某人那儿得到下一步的指示
John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next.

184
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,035
我想我弄错了
I guess I was mistaken.

185
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,035
这不重要
It doesn't... doesn't matter.

186
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,009
依计划行事  继续走  营地不远了
Plan's the same. we keep movin'. the barracks aren't far.

187
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,055
如果她的人和Jack在一起
If her team is with jack's group,

188
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,032
他们知道我们要去营地
They know we're going to the barracks.

189
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:13,032
红发女郎穿了防弹衣
Yeah,and red here was wearing a vest.

190
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,088
就表明她的人肯定准备跟我们火并一场
Which means her posse's gonna come Expecting themselves a gunfight.

191
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:18,052
 他们要的是她  我们就放她走
if all they want is her, maybe we should just let her go.

192
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:22,006
我是说  我们干脆藏起来
I mean,i thought we were just gonna go hide.

193
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,076
干嘛要带着囚犯
Why do we need to take prisoners?

194
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,056
-因为她还有利用价值  -怎么利用她?
We're keeping her because she's gonna be valuable. how is she gonna be valuable?

195
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,069
他是说将我做人质  亲爱的
He means as a hostage,luv.

196
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:32,019
不  我可不是来干这个的
Unh-unh. no,this is not what I signed up for.

197
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,016
-那你是来干什么的  -我意思是我们...
What did you sign up for,hugo? look,i'm just saying I think we

198
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:37,050
如果放她走  他们会觉得我们有诚意
If we let her go,they'll look at it as a sign of good faith.

199
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,085
他们会觉得我们很愚蠢 
They'll look at it as an act of foolishness, Which is what it would be.

200
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:41,050
我只是想提个妥协的建议 
I'm just trying to come up with some sort of compromise

201
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,052
妥协是没用的
We're beyond compromise.

202
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:47,049
现在  我说了算  Hugo
And right now,hugo,i'm making the decision.

203
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:50,025
你有意见吗
Is that gonna be a problem for you?

204
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:59,075
很糟糕吧?
Kinda sucks,huh?

205
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,059
什么?
what's that?

206
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,079
Sayid让你别去
Being told not to come along.

207
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,026
现在你明白我的感受了
Now you know what it feels like to be me.

208
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:14,086
是不是说我该等个20分钟  再跟他们去?
Does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and ago anyway?

209
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,066
好笑
touch?

210
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:28,031
你应该和他们走  Kate
You should go with them,kate.

211
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,008
你是认真的?
you're serious?

212
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,031
是的
yeah.

213
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:37,075
你不信任Sayid?
What,don't you trust sayid?

214
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:39,051
我不信任Locke
I don't trust locke.

215
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,085
万一他对我就像他对Naomi一样怎么办?
So what's preventing him from doing to me what he did to naomi?

216
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,097
Sawyer不会让他这么干的
Sawyer won't let him.

217
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:05,035
还有我的位子吗
Got room for one more?

218
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,032
她有枪
Oh,yeah,she gets a gun.

219
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:10,062
万不得已才用枪
The gun's a last resort,kate

220
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,059
你也是这么对Locke说的?
You give locke that same speech?

221
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,062
我们出发吧
Hey! let's move out.

222
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,096
那个叫Sayid的  他是哪儿的人
This guy sayid-- where's he from?

223
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:29,009
伊拉克
iraq.

224
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:30,079
伊拉克?
iraq.

225
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,096
他能处理好这些事?
So he's just gonna go and work everything out?

226
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,092
他是干嘛的  外交官?
What was he,a diplomat?

227
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,076
不
No

228
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:44,012
他是个拷问官
He was a torturer.

229
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:58,012
Naomi  你们是朋友吗?
Naomi-- were you close to her?

230
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:00,016
不  上了船才认识的
Nope. met her on the boat.

231
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,099
看来你对她的死没什么感觉
You don't seem particularly affected by her death.

232
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:07,009
不  我有感觉  她身材很辣  我替她感到惋惜
Sure I'm affected. she was hot,and I dug her accent.

233
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:08,052
真不错
nice.

234
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,015
而这个叫Charlotte的
And this woman--charlotte.

235
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:11,089
你也不太关心她  是不
You don't really care about her,do you?

236
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,016
怎么才算关心?
define "care."

237
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,009
朋友间的感情
So much for camaraderie.

238
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,009
对  谁是才是带枪追捕
Yeah,gee,who's the one going after

239
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:19,009
共同落难的朋友的人?
One of their crash buddies with guns?

240
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:21,009
事实上  我更关心Locke
Actually,i do care about locke.

241
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,076
也许你能告诉我
Maybe you can tell me

242
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,026
他是怎样让你们起内讧的
How he managed to split your happy little family in half.

243
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,079
我们为了你们
There was a fundamental debate

244
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,076
是来杀我们还是救我们
As to whether your people were coming to rescue us

245
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,096
而起了分歧
or kill us.

246
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,013
那你是哪一派?
And which side did you land on?

247
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,020
我决定了就告诉你
I'll let you know when I decide.

248
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,030
你很英俊
You look fantastic.

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,096
所以我才要带你去剧院
This is why I wanted to take you to the opera.

250
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,060
第五次约会还不能穿礼服  那就没必要约会了 
If a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date,why bother?

251
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,030
你知道吗
you know what?

252
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:29,023
我不会带着
I'm not bringing it.

253
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:31,023
如果他呼我了
If tonight's the night he calls,

254
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:33,003
就让他去吧
so be it.

255
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:39,043
我帮你带着
i'll carry it.

256
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:43,090
如果他真的呼了  我不想你怪罪我
If he does call,i don't want you fired over me.

257
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:46,096
你该跟他说  现在有更先进的
You should tell your employer that there is newer technology.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,053
我试过了  可他很保守
Well,i've tried. he's very old-fashioned.

259
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:53,023
你知道老板都这样
You know how bosses can be.

260
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,093
你有老板吗
Do you have a boss?

261
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:58,056
人人都有上司  Elsa
Everyone has a boss,elsa.

262
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,096
走吧  别迟到了
Come on. we don't want to be late.

263
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:07,023
你怎么还在柏林
Why are you still here?

264
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:13,026
我们初次见面时,你说你只在这待一周
I mean,when we met, you said you would only be in berlin for one week.

265
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:18,006
工作的进度比我想象的要慢
The job I'm on is proving harder to accomplish than I thought.

266
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,030
噢
oh.

267
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,040
是这样
right.

268
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,036
真希望是因为我的缘故
I was hoping it was because of me.

269
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,033
走吧
Let's go.

270
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:42,023
Strauss在等着呢
Strauss awaits.

271
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,033
他是什么人?
What's his story?

272
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:25,013
-Daniel?  -说不清
Daniel? ah,couldn't tell you.

273
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,070
他跟我说的  我都是左耳进
Half the stuff he says is way over my head.

274
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,027
右耳出
The other half goes way,way over.

275
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:33,011
Frank  我能...  不好意思打扰了

他们把我撇下了
They left me.

315
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:33,014
Locke背离了原先的约定
Locke's gone off the reservation,man.

316
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,014
我是说  他带走了那个小妞
I mean,he took this one chick hostage,

317
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:37,099
他说是Walt叫他杀了Naomi的

Walt?
walt?

319
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:41,074
伙计  别问了  我只是想和他辩论一下
Dude,don't ask. I was,like,just trying to argue with him

320
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:43,080
但是他就变脸了  但是
So he would just,like,you know,chill,but,

321
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,048
你能不能别唠里唠叨

322
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:48,074
-就告诉我们他们怎么了  他们在哪里?

Who are you?Where the hell did they go,tubby?

Oh,awesome. the ship sent us another sawyer.

325
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:56,078
Hurley  他们去哪儿了?
Hurley,where did they go?

326
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,091
我想他们光顾着绑我忘记给我说了
L-look,i guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me.

327
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:02,014
-我不知道  -因此他们全都走了
I don't know. and so they all left,all together?

328
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:05,010
对  他们很反常  Locke说船上的人
Yeah,they were freaked. locke said that the people on the ship

329
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:07,010
是来救Charlotte然后就会杀了我们
Were coming to rescue charlotte and then to kill us.

330

是这样吗
So... are you?

331
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,046
至少现在不是
Not yet.

332
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,090
他们提到过什么可以看出他们去哪儿了吗
Did they say anything that suggested where they were going next?

333
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:21,006
Locke说过他们 
Uh,locke said they were

334
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,033
在离开以前会路过Ben的那所房子
Gonna go by ben's house before they took off.

335
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:25,063
-为啥他要去那里?  -就我所知
Why would he go there? for all I know,

336
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:28,077
-他们也把Ben给关在橱子里了  -Ben的房子在哪儿
They could've locked ben up in the closet,too. where's ben's house?

337

介意我请教你个问题吗?

00:22:39,097 --> 00:22:41,097
波士顿红袜队拿到了总冠军?
The red sox really win the series?

340
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:45,064

Hey,don't get me started on that,all right?

341
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:48,067

My dad's from the bronx. I bleed yankee blue.

I can't believe.It's been a hundred days since I've seen a game.

343
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,097

是个火箭
It's a rocket.

347
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:31,020
不不
Oh,no.

348
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,090
大事不妙
This is not good.

349
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,066
你的朋友们回来了
Your friends are back.

350
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,063
瞧啊
Look at that.

351
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:08,053
看能否找到显示他们去处的痕迹
Look for anything that might show where they've gone.

352
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:11,066
我从这里找
I'll start in here.

353
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:14,070
Sayid!
Sayid!

354
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:21,046
别担心  Kate没事
Don't worry. kate's fine.

355
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,066
干得好  Hugo

抱歉  伙计

357
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,050
很抱歉  Sayid  我不是针对你 
I'm sorry,sayid. nothing personal.

358
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:40,043
Locke在哪？
Where's locke?

359
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:42,043
正跟那个生气的中国人说话
Talking to that angry chinese guy.

360
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:45,026
我不会伤害你的  Hurley
I'm not going to hurt you,hurley.

361
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,076
是吗...我见过你象跳霹雳舞一样
Yeah... I saw you snap that guy's neck

362
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,033
用腿扭断了那人的脖子
With that break-dancing thing you do with your legs.

363
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:52,036
我可得掂量着点 
I think I'll hang back here.

364
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:03,036
那么...
Well...

365
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:05,086
我猜他们逃出了监狱
I guess they're running out of jail space

366
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:12,079
你知道  我已经输了一块钱了
I lost a dollar,you know.

367
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:14,046
怎么输的?
How'd you manage that?

368
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,096
我和John打赌你不会蠢到 
I bet john that you wouldn't be stupid enough

369
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,019
为了朋友  像个诱饵似的被捕
To fall for your friend as bait.

370
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:23,089
你了解友谊?
What do you know about friendship?

371
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:27,092
我知道有个自己不信任的朋友是没用的
I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.

372
00:27:34,022 --> 00:27:36,042
我是你的囚犯了?
So what I'm your prisoner?

373
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:40,056
如果那么说能让你好受些的话 
If that sorta thing turns you on.

374
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:51,096
你和Locke混在一起干嘛
What are you doing here with locke?

375
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,066
-我没和他一起  -你就是  James
I'm not with him. yeah,you are,james.

376
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:58,009
-那你跟Jack在一起干嘛  -我和他一道  是因为我相信
Then what are you doing with jack? I went with jack because I believe

377
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:00,046
他能把我们带出岛
He can get us off this island.

378
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:07,032
我想这就是我们的区别所在
Then I guess that's the difference between us.

379
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:10,089
我没想着要走
I ain't lookin' to leave.

380
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,092
为什么不
Why not?

381
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:20,032
因为回去对我已经没什么意义了
Cause I ain't got nothin' back there for me.

382
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:23,082
那在这有什么好?
And what's here that's so much better?

383
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:26,052
你又为什么要回去  Kate?
Why do you wanna go back,kate?

384
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:31,089
那应该只会让你想起我们来这之前
Seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail

385
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:34,032
你被关在监狱的日子
Before we landed here.

386
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:37,036
如果你认为除了手铐还有什么别的
So if you think there's anything waitin' for you back home

387
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,002
在等你回去的话
Other than handcuffs,

388
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:42,009
那你真是不清楚这个世界是什么样的
Then you really don't know how the world works.

389
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,052
看看周围  雀斑女
Look around us,freckles.

390
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,069
我们有房屋...
We got roofs over our heads...

391

有电  淋浴  床

多久  Sawyer?
How long,sawyer?

393
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,092
你觉得我们玩多久过家家?
How long do you think we can play house?

394
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:03,032
让我们拭目以待
Why don't we find out?

395
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:23,022
冰茶
Iced tea.

396
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:31,002
我觉得你可能口渴了
I thought you might be thirsty.

397
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,048
我渴了
I'm thirsty.

398
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:37,075
骗了你我很抱歉
I'm sorry about all the theatrics,

399
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:40,092
但是  我不知道你们会有多少人
But,uh,i didn't know how many of you there would be

400
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:43,035
也不知道你们有没有武器
Or whether you'd be armed.

401
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,008
我必须得...  保住自己
I had to... cover my bases.

402
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:47,008
你把Miles和Kate怎么了?
What have you done with miles and kate?

403
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:50,015
Kate跟Sawyer在一起  Miles在别的地方
Kate's with sawyer,and miles is somewhere else.

404
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:55,095
他很好  我只不过问了他一些问题
He's fine. all I did was ask him some questions.

405
00:29:56,018 --> 00:29:57,098
他回答了吗  -没有
Did he answer any? no.

406
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:01,085
你们抓的那个女人有没有说些什么?
Did you have more luck with the woman you captured?

407
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,005
没什么有用的
Not particularly.

408
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,081
-那么把她交给我吧  -我为什么要那么做?
Then why don't you turn her over to me? and why would I do that?

409
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,081
我同意这些人是群骗子
I agree that these people are liars.

410
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:13,001
他们来这也不是为了救我们
And they're certainly not here to rescue us.

411
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:14,081
但如果我把Charlotte完好地交给他们
But if I return safely with charlotte,

412
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:16,082
他们会让我一起上船
They'll take me to their ship.

413
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:18,082
这将会是我们找出它们真实身份
It's our best chance at finding out who they are

414
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,035
和意图的最好方法
And what they really want.

415
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,035
我能省去你这些麻烦  Sayid
Well,then,i can save you a lot of trouble,sayid,

416
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,055
因为Ben说有一个他的间谍在船上
Because ben says he's got a spy on the boat.

417
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,022
谁?
Who?

418
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:31,072
保密
It's a secret.

419
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:36,049
对不起,不过相信他就是出卖灵魂
Forgive me,but the day I start trusting him Is the day I would have sold my soul.

420
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:38,042
把Charlotte交给我
Give me charlotte,

421
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:40,049
允许我用自己的方式做事
Allow me to do things my way,

422
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:44,006
否则纷争一旦开始就不是我们能控制的了
Or a war is coming which we will both be powerless to stop.

423
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,013
我为什么要把Charlotte白白给你?
Why would I give you charlotte for nothing?

424
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,043
你误会了
Oh,i think you misunderstood me.

425
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,069
我没想让你把她白白交给我
I never expected you to give her to me for nothing.

426
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:10,039
穿衣服吧?
Should we get dressed?

427
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:12,009
不
No

428
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:16,016
我们总得在什么时候
Well  we're gonna have to get out of this bed

429
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,083
离开这张床吧
At a certain point

430
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:19,089
为什么?
Why?

431
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,079
为了这个
Well,for one thing,

432
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,095
因为我知道最终
Because I know that eventually

433
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:27,045
你必须要去工作
You're gonna have to go to that job of yours.

434
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:31,001
你知道  就是那个你从不肯谈起的工作
You know,the one you never talk about.

435
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,031
没什么可说的  就是份工作而已
There's nothing to talk about. it's just a job.

436
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,041
我对你一无所知
I know nothing about you.

437
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:44,068
我理解你不想谈那次坠机
I understand you don't want to talk about the crash,

438
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,091
你遭遇了什么?
What happened to you.

439
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:48,085
但现在的生活怎么样
But what about life now?

440
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,085
现在的你又如何?
What about you?

441
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:53,088
你就是这样谈恋爱的  对吧?
That's what you do when you're in love,right?

442
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:59,068
谈恋爱?
In love?

443
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:05,001
是啊
Yeah.

444
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,021
好
Okay.

445
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,028
我都实话说了吧
No more secrets.

446
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,018
你想知道些什么?
What do you want to know?

447
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:39,081
是他...
He's here...

448
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:41,081
我老板
My boss.

449
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,048
我...
I,uh...

450
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,064
-我要走了 -现在?
I have to go. now?

451
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:49,091
去哪?
Where?

452
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:55,054
Adlon 宾馆
Hotel adlon.

453
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,058
我的衣服呢
Where's my dress?

454
00:33:07,058 --> 00:33:10,054
Elsa? 
Elsa?

455
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:14,068
你必须得离开Berlin
You have to leave berlin.

456
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:16,024
什么
What?

457
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:19,021
你不能再呆在这儿了
You can't be here anymore.

458
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:20,061
你是什么意思  我不能...
What do you mean? why would i--

459
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:22,057
人们会马上疑问
People will be asking questions soon

460
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:24,084
你的老板发生了什么事
About what happened to your employer.

461
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,097
而你不能在这回答他们的问题
And you can't be around to answer them.

462
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:35,024
我的老板?
My employer?

463
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:42,051
这...  这是关于我的老板的?
This... this is about my boss?

464
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:47,024
你到底是谁
Who are you?

465
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:50,051
-这无关紧要  -在咖啡厅...
It has nothing to do with how-- the cafe...

466
00:33:50,054 --> 00:33:53,091
你故意接近我?
You meant to meet me there?

467
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:57,004
你利用我来接近我的老板?
You used me to get to my boss?

468
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:59,063
你刚刚说什么  人们会问他发生了什么事
What did you say--people will ask what happened to him?

469
00:33:59,063 --> 00:34:00,084
最好你不知道
it's best you don't know.

470
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:02,037
你要去杀他吗
Are you gonna kill him?

471
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:09,011
你真的要去杀他吗
You're gonna kill him?

472
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,044
你和他又素不相识
Do you even know him?

473
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:14,087
他在名单之列
His name is on a list.

474
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:18,013
-名单?  什么名单?  你有一份名单?  -我老板的
A list?! what list? you--you have a list? my employer's.

475
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:20,037
-你老板是谁  -他是谁不重要
Who is that? it doesn't matter who he is!

476
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,063
你杀人就因为他在名单上吗? 那无辜的人呢？  
So you just kill people 'cause they're on a list?Innocent people?

477
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:27,047
你的老板并不是经济学家
The man you are working for is not an economist.

478
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:44,095
你打算十点半和我见面吗？
You were supposed to page me at ten-thirty.

479
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,042
我还没有杀他
No, I didn't kill him.

480
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:50,027
他不打算放弃那份名单
He's not going to give up the name now.

481
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:52,002
为什么不杀他？
Why should I keep him alive?

482
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:55,062
不  他不知道
No. He had no idea.

483
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:58,002
好的  好的
All right, all right.

484
00:34:58,027 --> 00:35:00,027
我会带他到你那去的
I'll bring him to you.

485
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:02,027
离开旅馆
Leave the hotel.

486
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:04,002
安全屋见
I'll meet you at the safe house.

487
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:12,000
你以为你...
What do you think you're--

488
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:08,063
我最后问你一次
Hey,i'm gonna ask you one last time.

489
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,048
为什么Naomi带着我的照片
Why was naomi carrying this picture of me?

490
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:11,094
伙计  要知道
Look,man,you gotta understand something.

491
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:13,057
她是我的上司
She was senior management.

492
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,057
我们并不一起做事
It's not like we hung around the cafeteria together.

493
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,060
-她一向单枪匹马  -Naomi告诉过我你们受雇于她
She stayed on her own-- look, naomi told me you people were hired by her.

494
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,097
看着我的双眼
So you look me right in the eye

495
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:26,037
告诉我你从来没有见过和听说过Penelope Widmore
And tell me you've never seen or heard of penelope widmore.

496
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:37,081
好吧,你不想告诉我真相
Fine. You don't want to tell me the truth?

497
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:39,044
我会去找别人
I'll find someone who will.

498
00:36:39,048 --> 00:36:42,014
明白吗  飞机起飞时  我也要在上面
See,when that takes off,i'm on it.

499
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:50,044
他回来了
He's back.

500
00:37:08,098 --> 00:37:10,084
Kate在哪里
Where's kate?

501
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:13,007
她决定留下来
She decided to stay.

502
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:20,067
Miles怎么了
What happened to miles?

503
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:22,044
-我做了交易  -交换?
I traded him. traded him?

504
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:24,044
我保证过把Charlotte带来  她现在来了
I promised you charlotte. here she is.

505
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:28,014
你作弊了
You cheated.

506
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:30,024
-是吗  -是的
Did i? yes,you did.

507
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:33,078
你真幸运  这家伙对我来说是个讨厌鬼
Lucky for you,that guy's nothing but a pain in my ass.

508
00:37:36,064 --> 00:37:37,031
你还好吗
You all right?

509
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:39,051
好了  这样多了一个空位
All right,that gives us room for one more.

510
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:41,028
你走吗  Charlotte
Charlotte?

511
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:44,078
我在这儿很开心啊
Go back,with all the fun I'm having here?

512
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:47,018
不是  我在这儿还有工作
No. I've got work to do.

513
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:50,088
Daniel  如果你想的话就跟我们走

我  不想走  谢谢
I--no,thank you.

515
00:37:52,055 --> 00:37:55,012
我想我应该和Charlotte呆在一起
I think I should probably just stay with charlotte.

516
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:57,062
那好吧
All right.

517
00:37:57,065 --> 00:38:00,005
嘿  Frank
Hey,frank.

518
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,038

519
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:04,085
就...就一件事情
Just--just... just one thing.

520
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:06,065
一定确保
Just be sure

521
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,035
你们一定
That you follow

522
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,052
要走我们来的方向  好吗
The same exact bearing that we came in on,okay?

523
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:13,035
不管发生什么
No matter what.

524
00:38:13,038 --> 00:38:17,062
只有那样  我意思是不管怎么就保持那个航线
By that,i mean no matter what. just... stay on it.

525
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,052
知道了
Roger that.

526
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:21,072
好的

527
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,032
小心点
Be careful.

528
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:32,046
我不必说服你和我们一起走
I don't have to talk you out of coming.

529
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:37,009
我其实很喜欢坐直升机... 我想你很会用这个
As much as I like helicopter rides, I think you got this one under control.

530
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:38,076
祝我好运吧

533
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:48,076

534
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,079
是的  怎么？
Yeah. why?

535
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:55,049
你应该带Naomi回家
You should bring naomi home.

536
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,073
脱下你的衣服
Take your shirt off.

537
00:40:59,096 --> 00:41:01,073
她死了吗
Is she dead?

538
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:04,079
是的
Yes.

539
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:09,023
她为什么没有杀你
Why didn't she kill you?

540
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:14,079
她试图从我这儿套信息
She was trying to get information from me.

541
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:17,033
什么信息
What sort of information?

542
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:27,013
她想知道我为谁工作

她想知道你

544
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:31,086
她当然想知道
Of course she did.

545
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,083
你哭是因为痛吗
Are you crying because it hurts,

546
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:41,039
还是你傻到真的关心她?
Or because you were stupid enough to care for her?

547
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:46,059
这些人不值得我们的同情
These people don't deserve our sympathies.

548
00:41:46,063 --> 00:41:48,073
需要我来提醒你吗?
Need I remind you what they did

549
00:41:48,076 --> 00:41:51,086
上次你就过于仁慈
The last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun?

550
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:55,076
你也用这招诱使我为你杀人
You used that to recruit me to killing for you.

551
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,069
你还想不想保护你的朋友  Sayid?
Do you wanna protect your friends or not,sayid?

552
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:07,073
我告诉你下一个目标的名字
