1
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,065
那是什么
What's that?

2
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:32,099
Faraday给我画的草图
Cheat sheet faraday drew for me.

3
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,052
你不知道你们的船在哪?
You don't know where your boat is?

4
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,029
我知道
I know where it is.

5
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:52,099
那为什么你径直的朝雷暴云的地方飞
Why are you flying directly into the thunderhead?

6
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:57,052
你就不能安稳的坐着  让我自己搞定吗
Why don't you just sit back and let me do my job, huh?

7
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,032
她就是Penelope?
Is that penelope?

8
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:10,029
她给Charlie说她不知道这艘船  是吗
She told charlie she didn't know about this boat, correct?

9
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:11,082
对
Aye.

10
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:16,006
-你想在那找到什么  -答案
What do you expect to find when you get there? answers.

11
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:33,086
糟糕
Damn it!

12
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,062
坐稳了
Hold on!

13
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:48,042
全体立正
On your soddin' feet!

14
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:50,038
快  快  快
Move! move! move!

15
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:55,005
你还在干嘛  Hume
What are you waiting for, hume?

16
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:03,015
你怎么了  Hume
What's the matter, hume?

17
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:04,082
没听见我说话吗?
Did you not hear me?

18
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:07,082
抱歉长官  我...  我刚才做梦了
I'm sorry, sir. I was-- I was having a dream, sir.

19
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,035
你做梦了?!
You were having a dream, were you?

20
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,052
你梦见什么了
And what were you dreaming about?

21
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:15,095
让你慢吞吞的准备好
That it took you so sodding long to get to your mark?!

22
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:20,072
我梦见自己在一架直升飞机上  长官
I was in a helicopter, sir,

23
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:23,022
风暴来袭  长官
And there was a storm, sir.

24
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:24,095
还有...
And...

25
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:27,038
我不记得其他的了  长官
I don't remember the rest, sir.

26
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:31,068
至少还是个他妈的关于军队的梦
Well, at least it was a bloody military dream.

27
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:36,042
好!  你们所有人
Right! all of ya!

28
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:39,022
立刻到操场  4分钟之内集合
In the yard! four minutes!

29
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,022
你们可以私下里感谢Hume
And you can thank private hume

30
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,068
他让你们的操练时间增加两倍
For having to do it in double-time.

快!  一!  二!  三!

36
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,084
一!  二!  三!
One! two! three...

37
00:02:57,084 --> 00:03:00,074
我希望为了你的梦值得做这些  伙计
I hope your dream was worth this, mate.

38
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:02,057
抱歉兄弟  只是...
Sorry, pal. it's just...

39
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:05,007
从没有过如此真实的梦
I've never had a dream that was so vivid.

40
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:06,089
就好象...好象我真的在那
It was--it was like I was actually there.

41
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:08,057
你要发表什么意见吗  Hume?
have you got something to say, Hume?

42
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,077
我在问你话!
I asked you a question!

43
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:16,065
就要通过了
We're almost through it.

44
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:18,055
我看到阳光了
I see daylight.

45
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,085
你知道你在做什么吗?
What do you think you're doing?

46
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,055
Desmond  你还好吧?
Desmond, are you all right?

47
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:30,031
你是谁
Who are you?

48
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:34,048
你怎么知道我的名字
How do you know my name?!

52
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,098
来
Here you go.

53
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:04,001
好吧  他们一天前走的
All right, they took off a day ago.

54
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:06,001
为什么到现在还没有消息
Why haven't we heard from 'em?

55
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:07,051
我再给你说一遍
I'm gonna tell you again,

56
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:10,011
医生  一晚上我都给你说了我也不知道啊
As I've been telling you all night, doctor, I don't know!

57
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:13,021
我给船上通话的内容你也听到了
You heard the same thing as I did when we called the boat.

58
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:16,038
-你凭什么认为我知道些什么  -因为你不担心
What makes you think I know anything? because you're not worried.

59
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,001
什么?
Excuse me?

60
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,001
你们的船离这里40英里
Your boat's 40 miles off the coast.

61
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,001
只用花20分钟就到了
It should've taken 'em, what, 20 minutes to get there?

62
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:26,048
-你为什么一点也不担心  -那我是不是应该
So why aren't you worried? well, should I wring my hands together

63
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:29,034
双手祈祷他们不要出事呢
And whisper a prayer on their behalf?

64
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,034
别这样
Hey, hey, hey. come on.

65
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,018
要不我们...直接告诉他们
Maybe we should just-- just tell 'em.

66
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,031
告诉我们什么
Tell us what?

67
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:40,021
Dan...别让他们更晕了
Dan... let's not confuse anyone.

68
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:44,044
Daniel  也许你讲慢一点
Well... daniel, maybe if you talk real slow,

69
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,068
我们能听懂
We'll be able to follow.

70
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:54,068
你们所感知的你们朋友离开了多久
Your perception of how long your friends have been gone...

71
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:59,018
其实并不是他们实际就离开了那么久
It's not necessarily how long they've actually been gone.

72
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,044
什么意思
What does that mean?

73
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,038
就不该这样
This is a mistake.

74
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,051
没事的
It'll be fine. it'll be fine.

75
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:09,051
Frank只要按照我给他的方位图飞行
As long as frank flew on the bearings that I gave him,

76
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:12,008
他按照那个来飞行的话...就会没事
If he stayed on it, it... it'll be fine.

77
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,004
如果他没有呢
And what if he didn't?

78
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:19,004
那可能就会出现些副作用
Then there might be side effects.

79
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:23,061
-我们在2000英尺的高空  坐好了  -我在这干嘛
We're at 2,000 feet. sit down! what am I doing here?!

80
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,011
-到底是怎么了  -Desmond有点不对劲
What the hell's going on?! something's wrong with desmond.

81
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:26,014
-你怎么知道我的名字?  -让他坐稳了
How do you know my name?! hold him in his seat!

82
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:28,024
-我不是在做吗  -让我离开
I'm trying! let go of me!

83
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,028
别让他碰着操纵杆了  我们还有两分钟到达
Keep him away from the stick! we'll be there in two minutes!

84
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,011
你回来干嘛?  他们是谁
What are you doing back? who are they?

85
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,034
大洋航班815的幸存者
Survivors of 815.

86
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,032
你把他们带到这里  你到底在想什么?
So you brought them here. what the hell were you thinking?

87
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:31,028
我在哪?
Where--where am i?

88
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:33,068
-好了  放松  -你们是谁
All right, just take it easy. who are you people?

89
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:36,028
放松  伙计
buddy. okay, now, take it easy, buddy.

90
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,038
-我为什么会在这  你们是谁  -我朋友有点失常了
what am I doing here? who are you people? my friend is disoriented.

91
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,064
我不是你的朋友  我根本不认识你
Look, I'm not your friend! I don't know you!

92
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,018
他什么时候开始这样的
when did he start doing this?

93
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:46,061
我们起飞的时候还好好的  当遇见暴风时...
He was fine when we took off. when we hit some weather--

94
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:49,078
Faraday告诉我只要按照他的方向
Hey, faraday told me as long as I stayed on the vector

95
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:53,051
等等
wait.

96
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,001
你叫什么  朋友
What's your name, my friend?

97
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:58,058
-Sayid  -好的Sayid  我们要把你的兄弟
Sayid. okay, sayid. look, we're gonna take your buddy

98
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:00,084
带到下面的医务室  好吗
Down to the sick bay, okay?

99
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:03,024
-我和他一起  -让我们的医生先照顾他吧
I'm going with him. let our doctor look at him first,

100
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:05,024
然后你再下来也行
Then you can come down.

101
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:07,054
我答应你  好吗
You got my word on that, okay?

102
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:18,007
听着  这一定是哪里弄错了
hey, listen to me-- th-this is a mistake, right?

103
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,021
我不认识这些人
I don't know these people.

104
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:22,049
我真的不认识这些人
I don't know these people.

105
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:23,054
不  这一定是弄错了
No, but this is wrong!

106
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:26,074
我不应该在这
I'm not supposed to be here.

107
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,048
20!  21!
20! 21.

108
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:30,034
22!  这?
22. "here"?

109
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,001
"这"什么
"here" what?

110
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:34,078
你在那站着干嘛
What the hell are you doing on your feet?

111
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:37,038
做完仰卧起坐了?
Are you finished with your crunches

112
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,091
你想跑步了?
Because you want to run?!

113
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:41,041
好!  集合
Right! squad!

向右转!
Right face!

116
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:48,058
10公里!
10 kilometers!

117
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:50,058
快!  快!  快!
Go! go! go! go! go! go! go!

118
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:54,058
-跑起来  -帮帮我  我受不了了
Get moving, or so help me, I'll kill you myself.

119
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:02,061
你是怎么了  Des
What the hell's the matter with you, des?

120
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,018
我告诉你的话  你一定认为我疯了
If I told you, you'd think I was crazy.

121
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,054
我已经认为你疯了
I already know you're crazy.

122
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:09,024
今天早晨
This morning,

123
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:12,051
当我在操场做仰卧起坐的时候
When I was in the yard doing crunches...

124
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:16,071
我离开了
I left.

125
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,054
什么意思  你离开了?
What do you mean, you left?

126
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:23,031
我在一艘船上
I was on a boat.

127
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:26,028
然后又回来了  就在开始的地方
And then--then I was back here, right--right where I started.

128
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,051
Des  如果你想逃脱军役的话
Des, if you're trying to get tossed out of service--

129
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:32,024
Billy伙计  我说的都是真的
Billy, I am telling you the truth, man.

130
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:36,041
船上还有什么人
Who else was on this... boat?

131
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:38,061
有你认识的吗
Anyone you recognize?

132
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,094
Penny
Penny.

133
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:47,068
有张照片  Penny在里面
There was a photo. penny was in the photo.

134
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:48,074
什么?
What?

135
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:51,048
Des  你去哪
des! where you going?!

136
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,091
今天早上真多亏了你  Hume
Thanks for this morning, hume.

137

小心点

158
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,071
你的朋友知道他怎么了
Your friends know what's wrong with him.

Well, if they do, they're not sharing it with me.

160

但你得相信我说的话

Be quick. don't go trying to call baghdad.

171
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,070
那种电话只能互相呼叫
Those phones only call each other.

172
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,010
是Jack吗  我是Sayid
Jack? it's Sayid.

173
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,070
我现在在货船上
I'm on the freighter.

174

你还好吗  你们到底在哪
Are you okay? where the hell have you been?

175
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:55,083
飞行中出了点事
Something happened during the flight,

176
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,034
Desmond现在在船上的医务室里
And now Desmond's in their sick bay.

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,054
别挂  别挂  别挂

00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:06,003
在直升机上  Desmond出了点事
On the helicopter, something happened to Desmond.

180
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,000
他看起来好象不认识我  也不知道他在哪
He doesn't appear to recognize me or know where he is.

181
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:13,014
是坐了飞机后的副作用吗
"side effects"?

182
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:18,013
等等  你的朋友Desmond  他...

或者是电磁辐射
Or electromagnetism?

185
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,069
我们也不知道为什么
Okay, look, uh, we don't know why,

186
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:30,088
但是有些人离开或来到这个岛
But going to and coming from the island,

187
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:33,093
就会感觉...有点困惑
Some people can get a little... confused.

188
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:37,084
什么  是健忘症吗

00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:37,021
-为什么他以为他在1996年 -我不知道  
Why does he think he's in 1996? I don't know. I don't know.

271
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:39,018
不可预知  是随机的原因
It's unpredictable. it's a random effect.

272
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
有时这种现象只会持续几个小时
Sometimes the displacement's only a couple of hours.

273
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,028
有时是几年
Sometimes it's years.

274
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,068
等等 等等  这以前发生过吗
Wait, wait, this has happened before?

275
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,094
电话给我  谢谢
The phone now, please. thank you.

276
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,017
-Desmond  还在吗  -医生  里面发生什么事了  
Desmond, are you still there? doc? hey, doc, are you okay in there?

277
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:53,093
-快说!  我坚持不了多久  -是的  我在  
Talk to him. I can't hold them for long. um, yes. yes, I'm here.

278
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:58,000
好  Desmond  听着  当你在女王学院找到我
Okay, Desmond, listen, when you find me at queen's college,

279
00:17:58,003 --> 00:18:01,090
我要你告诉我把设备设置到2.342
I need you to tell me to set the device to 2.342.

280
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:04,080
-什么  -知道了吗  是2.342
What? all right, you got it? 2.342.

281
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,048
振荡必须设置为11赫兹
And it must be oscillating at 11 hertz.

282
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,016
知道了吗  Desmond
You got it, Desmond?

283
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:13,005
是2.342  振荡设为11...
2.342, oscillating at 11...

284
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,032
记住...记住是2.342和11赫兹  好吗
Just--just remember that-- 2.342 at 11 hertz, all right?

285
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:18,026
还有一件事  Desmond
And one more thing, Desmond.

286
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:20,056
如果数字还不能说服我的话
If the numbers don't convince me,

287
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,067
我要你告诉我你知道埃勒维兹
I need you to tell me that you know about Eloise.

288
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,086
嘿  放松点  放松点  
Hey, hey, hey! easy, easy.

289
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:30,036
把电话给我
Get off the phone.

290
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:32,022
告诉我你记住了是埃勒维兹
Tell me that you know about Elo--

291
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,010
...不仅仅是原创的思想
...not a single piece of original thinking...

292
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:04,061
原创的概念是...
The concept of "original"--

293
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:07,005
就是派生的反义词
The opposite of derivative.

294
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,062
我是来给你留下印象的  Hollister先生
I am the one for you to impress, Mr. Hollister,

295
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:13,024
-我没印象  -那就再去试试
And I'm not impressed. so go. go try again.

296
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,005
抱歉  请问你是Daniel Faraday吗
Um, sorry, are--are you Daniel Faraday?

297
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:21,068
你是?
You are?

298
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:24,076
抱歉  我是  我是Desmond Hume
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm--i'm Desmond Hume, and, uh,

299
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,033
别人给我讲在这能找到你
I was told I could find you here.

300
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,010
我想我...
And I think I've...

301
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,037
我刚到过未来
I've just been to the future.

302
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,081
-未来?  -是的
The future? yes.

303
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,043
我在那和你说话
Uh, i-i spoke to you there.

304
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:39,074
你告诉我到这  牛津
You, uh, you told me to come here to--to oxford

305
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:44,020
你说  你可以帮我
You--you said you'd help me.

306
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,013
为什么我在未来不帮助你呢
Why didn't I just help you there in the future?

307
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,071
为什么我要把你送上时间旅行
Why would I put you through the headache of time traveling?

308
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:53,033
你知道我的意思吗
You--you know what I mean?

309
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,017
就感觉有点多此一举
It just seems a little... unnecessary?

310
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,043
你以为我那些受尊敬的同僚们
And don't you think my esteemed colleagues

311
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:00,036
会因为一点点的相信
Could've come up with something

312
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,068
而来找我吗
Just a little more believable, huh?

313
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:07,008
又是什么恶作剧?  时间上自相矛盾  毫无创见
What kind of a prank is that? time paradox--so uninspired.

314
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,076
把你的设备...设置到2.342
Set your device to, um... 2.342

315
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:16,013
然后确定振荡在11赫兹
And--and make sure it oscillates at 11.

316
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,015
好吧  你...
Okay, now--now you...

317
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:29,027
你告诉我是谁告诉你那些数字的
You're gonna tell me who told you those numbers.

318
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,014
是你
You did.

319
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,074
不可能  这完全是荒谬可笑的
No, this is... this is ridiculous.

320
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:35,073
我知道埃勒维兹
I know about Eloise.

321
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,039
这些到底是什么
What--what is all this?

322
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:53,015
这就是我做令牛津不舒服的事情的地方
This is where I do the things oxford frowns upon.

323
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:57,081
好  那么未来的我
All right, this... this future version of me,

324
00:20:58,013 --> 00:21:01,037
提到了我们这次会面  对吗?  一定提到过  
Uh, he--he referenced this meeting, right? obviously.

325
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,002
所以我一定会记得你来过这里  是吧
So--so I would remember you coming to oxford, right?

326
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,090
我会记得这件事情  在此时此刻
I would remember this, here, right now.

327
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,078
实际上你不记得
Actually, um, no.

328
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,085
-不记得了?  -也许你就是忘了
No? maybe you just forgot.

329
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,091
说的对  这怎么可能发生过?
Yeah, right. how would that happen?

330
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,077
那么你现在要改变未来?
So this--this is changing the future?

331
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:20,071
你不可能改变未来
You can't change the future.

332
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:23,057
-那是干嘛的?  -防辐射
What's that for? radiation.

333
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:28,019
-我也要穿吗?  -你不需要
Do I get one? you don't need one.

334
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,025
穿它是为了防护过量辐射  我每天要做20次
For prolonged exposure. i-i do this 20 times a day.

335
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:33,038
你不用戴什么保护头吗
So what do you put on your head?

336
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:38,006
是的
Yeah.

337
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:45,074
这个
This...

338
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,007
它是Eloise
This is Eloise.

339
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,019
你这是在做什么
What does this do?

340
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:02,097
这  如果你给我的数字是正确的
This... if the numbers you gave me are correct,

341
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,024
这将使Eloise
What this will do...

342
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:07,074
摆脱连续时空的限制
Is unstick Eloise in time,

343
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,037
就像你一样
Just like you.

344
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,027
发生了什么
What happened?

345
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,022
等等 别说话  她还没醒过来
Wait, shh, shh. she's not back yet.

346
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:38,041
好的  就看马上会有什么结果
Okay, here goes... everything.

347
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:42,032
动起来  动起来 
Come on, come on. come on.

348
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,002
对了
That's it.

349
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,039
对了  这就对了
That's it. that's it.

350
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,050
好  好
Yes, yes.

351
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:03,089
成功了!
It worked!

352
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,028
-这太不可思议了  -抱歉  等一下
Th-this is incredible. I'm sorry.

353
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,062
一只老鼠能跑出你这破迷宫有什么稀奇?
How is a rat running through a bloody maze so incredible?

354
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:10,064
不可思议的是
What is incredible

355
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,091
我今天早上刚做的这个迷宫
Is I just finished the maze this morning,

356
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:16,095
我原打算到从现在开始的一小时后
And I'm not gonna teach her how to run it

357
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,082
才教她怎么跑过这个迷宫
Until an hour from now.

358
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,012
这么说你刚才把它送到了未来
S-so--so you--you sent her to the future.

359
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,033
不  只是她的意识  思想
No, no, no, her consciousness, her mind.

360
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,038
这对我有什么帮助
So-- so how does that help me?

361
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:38,063
你?  帮助你?
You? help you?

362
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:40,043
我不明白  是我应该帮助你吗?
I don't understand. am I supposed to help you?

363
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,093
-难道我不是把你送回这里来帮助我吗  -我不知道你为什么让我来这
Didn't I send you back here to help me? I don't know why you sent me here.

364
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,086
我所知道的只有
All I know about you is you--

365
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:46,069
你最后困在了一个可怕的岛上
You end up on some bloody island.

366
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,078
什么岛?  为什么我会在一个岛上
What island? w-why would I go to an i--

367
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,001
Desmond  把电话给我
Desmond, give me the phone.

368
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:57,003
都怎么了  大家冷静一点!
Hey, come on! everybody relax!

369
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:59,030
听着  Daniel要给那个人打电话
Listen, look, Daniel wanted to talk to the guy,

370
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:02,061
-我们就把电话给他了  就是这样  -你让Faraday和他说话了?
So we brought him the phone, that's all. you let Faraday talk to him?

371
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:05,093
-他说他能帮上忙  -Faraday连自己都帮不了!
He said he could help. faraday can't even help himself!

372
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:08,071
出去  船长要跟你谈话
Outside now. the captain wants to talk to you.

373
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,076
-我也要跟你们船长谈一谈  -我一定会告诉他的
And I want to talk to your captain. I'll be sure to let him know.

374
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,043
还有  你们老老实实坐着
In the meantime, have a seat.

375
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:24,068
-去哪  那个岛?  -他说能帮得上忙
Back where? the island? he said he could help.

376
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,081
-他说他会告诉我需要去做什么  -Desmond  Desmond      
He said he--he'd tell me what I needed to do. Desmond, Desmond,

377
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:29,035
你能给我解释一下
Can you please explain to me--

378
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:30,023
Desmond?
Desmond?

379
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:33,005
你叫Desmond?
You're Desmond?

380
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:35,075
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

381
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,041
我是George Minkowski
I'm George Minkowski.

382
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:40,076
我是信号联络负责人
I'm the communications officer.

383
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,070
在他们把我绑在这之前
Before they strapped me down here,

384
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:46,049
我在信号室负责调度这艘船
All the calls to and from this boat came through me

385
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,067
所有的电信联络
In the radio room.

386
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:50,011
我经常
And every so often,

387
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:55,012
能看到信号灯在我的控制台上闪烁
I'd get this flashing light on my console--

388
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:57,031
有一个电话打进来
An incoming call.

389
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,079
我们被严令不许接听那个电话
We were under strict orders never to answer it.

390
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:04,058
那么你说的和我有什么关系
So? what's that got to do with me?

391
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:07,015
是你女朋友打来的
Those calls came from your girlfriend.

392
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,077
Penelope Widmore
Penelope widmore.

393
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:24,047
发生了什么事
What happened?

394
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:26,010
你醒了
Oh, uh, you're back.

395
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:29,063
你刚刚昏迷了大约有75分钟
And... you were out almost 75 minutes.

396
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:33,000
是的
Oh, yeah. yeah, yeah. you just... whew.

397
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,036
你刚说话的时候突然就摊在了地上
You went catatonic right in the middle of a sentence.

398
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,071
我只好把你扶到椅子上
I had to carry you to the chair.

399
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:40,084
-我想你刚才又回到了未来  -是吧
So I take it you were-- you were in the future again? aye.

400
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:44,007
-多长时间  -我不知道  五分钟?    
For how long? I don't know. five minutes?

401
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,064
为什么这种情况总在发生
Why does this keep happening?

402
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,016
我猜想你的请况
Uh, in your case,

403
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:52,093
应该症状呈指数级加重
I'm guessing the progression is exponential.

404
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:55,051
每一次你的意识穿梭时空
Each time your consciousness jumps,

405
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:57,066
都会变得更难以回到初始状态
It gets harder and harder to jump back.

406
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:01,011
如果我是你的话  过马路一定小心翼翼
I would be careful crossing the street if I were you.

407
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:11,019
她怎么了  死了
What happened to her? she died.

408
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:14,028
-我知道她死了  怎么死的?  -也许是脑动脉瘤  我还不确定  
Yeah, I can see that. how? brain aneurysm, probably. I don't know.

409
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:15,080
我待会给她验尸
I'm going to do an autopsy later.

410
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:18,040
我也会死吗
Is that gonna happen to me?

411
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:21,049
不同的个体受到的影响应该会有区别  但是
The effects seem to vary from case to case, but, uh...

412
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:23,008
快告诉我!
Answer me!

413
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,038
如果这种状况持续下去  我会不会死掉
If this keeps happening, am I gonna die?

414
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,059
我想
I think...

415
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:38,092
Eloise是脑梗阻
Eloise's brain short-circuited.

416
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,078
在现在和未来之间的频繁穿梭
The jumps between the present and the future--

417
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,059
她最终不能分辨出现在和未来
She eventually--she couldn't tell which was which.

418
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:47,022
-她没有能支撑自己穿梭时空的东西  -什么是anchor
She had no anchor. wh-what do you mean, "anchor"?

419
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,056
可以将两个时点联系起来的东西
Something familiar in both times.

420
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:51,083
所有这些  看到了吗  它们都是变量
All this--see this? this is all variables.

421
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:54,042
随机的  混乱的
It's random. it's chaotic.

422
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:57,025
所有的方程都需要稳定性  一些已知量
Every equation needs stability, something known.

423
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,039
就是常量
It's called a constant.

424
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,069
Desmond  你没有常量
Desmond, you have no constant.

425
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:04,026
当你穿梭到了未来  你对熟悉所有的事物都不熟悉
When you go to the future, nothing there is familiar.

426
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:06,073
如果你想阻止它再次发生
So if you want to stop this,

427
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:10,030
就要在未来找一样你珍视的事物
Y--then you need to find something there,

428
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:14,030
它一直深藏在你的内心深处
Something that you really, really care about...

429
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,069
同时存在于现在这个时点
That also exists back here...

430
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:20,008
1996年
In 1996.

431
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,049
这个常量
This constant...

432
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,097
它可以是一个人吗
Can it be a person?

433
00:27:29,092 --> 00:27:30,087
对  可以
Yeah, maybe.

434
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:33,075
但你一定要和这个人取得联系
But you have to make some kind of contact.

435
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,048
你刚才不是说你在一艘
Didn't you say you were

436
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:38,036
不知道在什么方位的船上吗
Off on a boat in the middle of nowhere?

437
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,022
你在给谁打电话
Uh... who are you calling?

438
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:45,082
我在给我珍惜的常量
I'm calling my bloody constant.

439
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,078
你所拨打的号码
The number you have dialed

440
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,097
无法接通
Has been disconnected.

441
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,022
你还好吗
You okay?

442
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:06,000
你看上去老了不少  是吧
You look a lot older now, huh?

443
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,027
欢迎回来  Desmond
Welcome back, Desmond.

444
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,065
-我要给Penny打电话  -给你女朋友打电话可不是当务之急
I need to call Penny. calling your girlfriend is not our priority.

445
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:16,092
听着兄弟  我不大认识你  但
Listen, brother, I don't know you, but--

446
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,001
你貌似认识我
But you seem to know me,

447
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:19,092
如果我和你是朋友
So--so if you and me are friends,

448
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:24,054
那么我需要你的帮助  我现在就要给Penny打电话
Then I need your help. I need to call Penny now.

449
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:27,031
小伙子们  你们可根本没弄清楚情况
Whoa! you boys are gettin' way ahead of yourselves.

450
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:29,091
两天前  有个人毁掉了所有的设备
Two days ago, someone sabotaged all the equipment.

451
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:33,021
我们与陆地失去了所有的联系
We lost all communication with the mainland.

452
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:37,046
我当时有可能修好它  但后来
I probably could've fixed it, but then...

453
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,060
我成了疯子
Then I went nuts.

454
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:39,071
信号室在哪儿
Where's the radio room?

455
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:43,073
在上面一层  我带你们去  快点
It's one deck up. I'll take you there. come on.

456
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,036
我们怎么才能离开这儿
And how do we get out of here?

457
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:49,073
门开了
Through the door.

458
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:57,007
貌似你俩在这船上还有朋友
Looks like you guys have a-a friend on this boat.

459
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:17,020
现在没人
It's clear.

460
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:37,030
"the black rock"从朴次茅斯港出发的
"the black rock" set sail

461
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,080
英国船  1845年3月22日
From portsmouth, english, march 22, 1845,

462
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,083
前往暹罗(泰国旧称)进行交易
On a trading mission to the kingdom of siam

463
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:45,020
不幸在海中走失
When she was tragically lost at sea.

464
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:48,019
这次旅行留下来的唯一见证物
The only known artifact of this journey

465
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:50,055
就是船上第一大副的日记
Is the journal of the ship's first mate,

466
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,032
它是七年后在马达加斯加岛的
Which was discovered among the artifacts of pirates

467
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:55,093
海盗船的遗物中被发现
On the sainte marie, Madagascar, seven years later.

468
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:59,006
日记的内容从来没有被公开过
The contents of this journal have never been made public,

469
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,088
或者被出售人家族以外的其他人所知晓
Nor are known to anyone outside the family of the seller,

470
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:03,027
Tovard Hanso
Tovard Hanso.

471
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:06,056
我们以15万英镑起拍这件
We open the bidding on lot 2-3-4-2

472
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,011
编号2-3-4-2的拍品
At 150,000 pounds.

473
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,013
这位先生  出价15万  
150,000, sir.

474
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:14,098

160,000? do I hear 160,000?

475
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,029
16万  17万
160,000, sir. 170,000, sir.

476
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:17,049
有人致电出价18万

34万镑
340,000 pounds.

484
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:34,078

360,000. 380,000. 380,000 pounds...

485
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,026
-拍卖是要提前预约的  先生  -有人出价40万镑吗?
This auction's by appointment only, sir. do I hear 400,000 pounds?

486
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,083
哥们  是这样子的  我只是想
Yeah, listen, pal, I just need to speak

487
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,046
-和那位先生说句话  -不好意思  先生
To the gentleman over there just for a moment, okay? I'm sorry, sir.

488
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:47,000
成交...  38万镑售予755号买主  谢谢
Sold... for 380,000 pounds to bidder 7-5-5. thank you.

489
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:49,025
只要一点时间  好吗?  听着...
Just for a minute, all right? look--

490
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:51,071
Widmore. Desmond先生?
Mr. widmore. desmond?

491
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:54,070
-能和你说句话吗  先生?  -对不起  Widmore先生  他...
Can I have a word, sir? I'm sorry, mr. widmore. he--

492
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:58,045
-哦  没事...  -这是Charles Dickens死时的财产
No, no, it's fine. ...possession of charles dickens when he died.

493
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,031
-跟我来  -我们开始竞拍此件物品...
Walk with me. we open the bidding on this lot...

494
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,028
说吧  想说什么
Your word. let's have it.

495
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:14,032
我要和Penny联系
I need to get in touch with penny.
513

496
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:17,021
我不知道如何联系她
I don't know how to reach her,

497
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:19,035
她的号码已经无效了
And her number's been disconnected.

498
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,098
曾经有段时间  如果你向她求婚的话
There was a time when if you'd have asked her to marry you,

499
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:25,016
我确信她一定会答应的
I'm certain she would've said yes.

500
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:27,048
但幸运的是...
Fortunately...

501
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,025
你的怯懦赢得了上风
Your cowardice won out instead.

502
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,080
我将此视为你又改变主意了
I take it you've had second thoughts.

503
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:45,043
你希望她能再给你一次机会
And you'd like her to give you another chance.

504
00:31:46,077 --> 00:31:47,083
为什么你这么恨我?
Why do you hate me so much?

505
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:51,003
恨你的不是我
It's not me who hates you.

506
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,035
这是她的地址
Here's her address.

507
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,052
让她自己告诉你吧
I'll let her tell you herself.

508
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:19,011
Desmond
Desmond.

509
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:24,050
我知道  越来越难了
I know. it's getting harder.

510
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,090
而且这种情况开始更快出现了
It starts happening faster, too.

511
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:29,083
来吧  行动吧
Come on. let's move.

512
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,038
喂  这怎么会发生在你身上的?
Hey, how did this happen to you?

513
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:40,042
我们在此下锚  等待命令
We were anchored here, waiting for our orders,

514
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:42,035
闷得要命
Bored out of our minds.

515
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:46,013
Brandon和我  他是其中一名船员
Me and brandon-- he's one of the crew members--

516
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:48,011
我们...我们驾着交通船
We--we took out the ship's tender.

517
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:51,061
我们就是想看看这个岛
We just wanted to see the island.

518
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,069
但是Brandon开始发疯
But brandon started acting crazy,

519
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,039
所以我们只能回返
So we had to turn around.

520
00:32:58,072 --> 00:33:00,057
他在哪里?  运尸袋里
Where is he? in a body bag.

521
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,014
那里
There.

522
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:11,038
谁干的?
Who did this?

523
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:13,014
这可问住我了
You got me.

524
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:15,077
但当船长发现的时候  我感觉很抱歉...
But when the captain finds out, I feel sor--

525
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,054
你打完电话后  最好有人能告诉我
After your call, someone has to tell me

526
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:23,096
到底是怎么回事
Precisely what is going on.

527
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:28,038
兄弟  你能修好吗?
Can you fix it, brother?

528
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,006
需要一点时间
I need a minute.

529
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:34,019
你有号码?
Do you have the number to make the call?

530
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,004
George?
George?

531
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,067
醒醒  兄弟  醒醒  你得醒过来  
Wake up, brother. wake up. you've gotta come back.

532
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:41,064
-你得醒过来  -Desmond  你知道号码吗?
You've gotta come back. desmond, do you know the number?

533
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:47,045
-不记得  -你最好能记住它
No. well, you'd better remember it.

534

现在是2004年
It's 2004.

535

我都没意识到快到圣诞节了  过了这么...

00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:16,049
回...
Get...

540
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:18,022
来了
Back.

541
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,017
他怎么了?
What happened to him?

542
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,030
同样要发生在我身上的事情
The same thing that's gonna happen to me.

543
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,097
你怎么来了?
What are you doing here?

544
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,033
我必须来...我是说  我尽力联系你
I had to--i mean, I tried to call you,

545
00:35:42,037 --> 00:35:45,021
-但是打电话联系不上你  -是  因为我搬家了
But you--you disconnected your phone. yeah, because I moved.

546
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,002
听着  我不知道你是否意识到
Look, I don't know if you're getting the signals, desmond,

547
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:50,094
但是我想和你完全断绝关系
But I'm trying to make a clean break from you,

548
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,083
-所以  如果你不介意  我要...  -等等  等等  Pen
So if you don't mind, I'm gonna-- wait, wait, wait, wait. pen,

549
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,022
请等一下
Please wait.

550
00:35:53,022 --> 00:35:55,005
我只是...我只是需要你的新号码  好吗?
I just--i just need to get your new phone number, okay?

551
00:35:55,094 --> 00:35:58,000
因为我...我犯了一个大错
Because i-i made a huge mistake.

552
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,055
我...我本不应和你分手  而且...  而且...
I-i should never have broken up with you, and--and--and... ugh.

553
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:03,011
我知道...我现在知道了  对不起  不要  请不要
I know--i know that now, and--and I'm sorry and-- oh, don't. just don't--

554
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:05,011
我知道  我也知道...
I understand, and--and i-i know

555
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:07,011
可是已经太晚了  难以挽回
It's--it's too late to change things,

556
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:09,026
但是我得告诉你
But I need to tell you something,

557
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:11,037
而且...而且我需要你听我说
And--and I need you to listen to me, and...

558
00:36:12,056 --> 00:36:13,087
听着  我...我知道那会听起来很荒谬  但是...
Look, i-i know it's gonna sound ridiculous, but...

559
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,015
求你了  Pen

请你听我说
I need you to listen to me.

561
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,092
说吧  说完就走
Just say what you need to say and then go.

562
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:34,062
我知道这不可理解
I know this doesn't make any sense,

563
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:36,014
因为我都不相信
Because it doesn't make any sense to me,

564
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,081
但是8年之后  我...

565
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,036
我需要给你打电话

00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:45,055
但是如果没有你的号码  就打不成电话
And I can't call you if I don't have your number.

567
00:36:46,077 --> 00:36:47,050
什么?

568
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,028
听着  Penny  只用...只用告诉我你的号码
Look, penny, just-- just give me your number.

569
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,051
我...我知道  我知道我把事情都搞砸了
I-i know-- I know I've ruined things.

570
00:36:51,054 --> 00:36:53,036
我知道你认为我们之间已经完了  但其实不是的
I know you think things are over between us, but they're not.

571
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:56,027
如果你对我们之间尚有一点信心  就请...
If there's any part of you that still believes in us, just...

572
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,025
就告诉我号码吧
Just give me your number.

573
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:01,054
我怎么知道你会不会今晚或明天打给我...
And what's to say you wouldn't call me tonight or tomorrow--

574
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,056
我不会
I won't call...

7946-0893. 7946...

583

All that, and you're not gonna write it down?

584
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:52,029
没什么用  你一定要一直用这个号码
It wouldn't do any good. you have to keep that number.

585
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:54,056
-在8年内你不要换号码  -出去  出去
You can't change your number for eight years. just get out. get out!

但是不知道电池能撑多久
