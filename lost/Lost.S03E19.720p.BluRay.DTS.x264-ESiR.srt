一个巨大的盒子

不管你怎么想象 那里面到底是什么

当你打开时 那东西就在你眼前
When you opened that box,there it would be?

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,000
我说那盒子里最好

怎么会是我?
I didn't bring him here.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,079
小心点John 别靠近他
I'd be careful about getting too close to him,John.

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,030

Well, where did you find him? Why did you bring him here?

我已经说过了 我们没有...

你想让我问他吗?

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,010

35
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,020
你不明白我们在哪里吗?
Don't you know where we are?

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,040
他是什么意思?
What did he mean?

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
恐怕我们没时间...
I'm afraid we don't have time

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,099
来讨论这件事了 John

我把他拽进了丛林
I tiedim up, dragged him off into the jungle.

81
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,030
你大老远的回来告诉我是因为...

82
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,089

Juliet正在你原来的营地搜集情报

我们干这个已经不是第一次了John

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,029
我要对你表示感激 John
I believe I have you to thank for this, John.

125
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,020
一周前我的脚趾还动不了...
A week ago, I couldn't move my toes...

126
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,099
而当你一出现
But the minute you showed up,

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,069
我就有酸痛的感觉
I started to feel pins and needles.

128
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,069
而这只是开始 John
And this is only the beginning, John.

129
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,009
我等不及要让你瞧瞧 这座岛到底能做什么
I can't wait to show you what this island can do,

130
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,099
但不幸的是
but unfortunately,

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,020
你还没有准备好 John
you're not ready, John.

132
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,030
不  我准备好了
No, I'm ready.

133
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,069
不  John你没有
No, John, you're not.

134
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:13,029
你还是那个瘫痪的人
You're still crippled by the memories of the man you used to be before you came to this island,

135
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,099
这样你永远得不到解脱
and you'll never be free

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,030
直到你解脱你父亲 给你带来的痛苦
until you release the hold that your father has over you.

137
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,049
你为什么要把他带到这里来?
Why do you think you brought him here?

138
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,099
那个神奇的盒子
The magic box.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,090
好了 Ben 为什么你不...
Okay, Ben, how about you show me...

140
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,090
"神奇的盒子"只是一个暗喻 John
"Magic box" is a metaphor, John.

141
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,030
我不能让你看 直到你...
I can't show you anythinguntil you can show me

142
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,049
愿意成为我们的人
that you're ready and willing to be one of us.

143
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,060
当人们加入我们的时候
When people join us here on this island,

144
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,039
他们需要作出某种姿态
they need to make a gesture

145
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,090
他们的愿望 他们的承诺

146
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,030
那就是为什么 你要杀了你的父亲

153
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,089
看看那边的海滩有什么

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,060
是啊  也能让他看看她的伤势
Yeah, I mean,shouldn't he check out her wound?

160
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,039
你能保证我们能相信Jack吗?
Can you give me your word that Jack can be trusted?

161

162
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,079
难道什么也没发生吗?

163
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,049
-还有那个整天和他粘在一起的女人...   -Juliet
And that woman he's spending all his time with... -Juliet.

165
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,029
Naomi...

166
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,040
你听见她说的话了
Well, you heard everything that she said.

167
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,089
如果我们能保证她的安全
If we keep her safe,

168
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,060
她就可以帮我们离开这里
she's our way off this island.

169
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,059
这样的话 你相信Jack
So given that,do you trust Jack,

170
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,000
还是不相信?
or don't you?

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,019
好啊  
Right.

172
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,060
我们要找一个信得过的人

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,089
你父母在你很小的时候就过世了

180
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,069
但不知道为什么
But it doesn't say why

181
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,020
你父亲杀了你母亲...

182
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,010
然后又杀了自己

183
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,000
对你来说一定很痛苦

184
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,099
还有呢?

188
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,019
这就是你为什么要用假名字了
I guess that's why you use an alias, huh?

189
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,050
为什么起Sawyer这个名字呢? 
Why did you choose the name Sawyer?

190
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,049
你以为我很傻吗?
How stupid do you think I am?

191
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,029
我已经被Ben骗过一次了
I already been conned by Ben once.

192
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,090
也许你听说过那只作过记号的小兔子

193
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,050
你以为我会跟你走进丛林?
You think I'm just gonna follow you through the jungle?

194
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,000
James求你了 你必须得相信我
Please, you have to...You have to trust me.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,090
你要把我带去哪里? 跟我说实话!
Where are you taking me? Tell me the truth!

196
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,059

-What do you want from me?   -I'm bringing you there to do exactly what I said...

-I had to.   -Why me?! Why won't you do it yourself?

199
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,029
-James求你了...   -别叫我James!
-James, please... -Don't call me James!

200
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,010
为什么你自己不下手?
Why won't you do it yourself?

201
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,000
因为我不能!我做不了!
Because I can't! I can't!I can't do it!

202
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,050
所以我就回来找你
That's why I came back for you.

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,060
起来
Get up.

204
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,019
我会跟你去你抓他的地方
I'll go to wherever you got him,

205
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,090
但我们要把他带回我们的营地
but then we're bringing him back to our camp.

206
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,029
我不会杀任何人的 你知道吗?

210

215
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,009
但你最好自己听一下

216
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,019
你们还没有告诉Jack?
And you haven't told Jack?

217
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,069
是的
No.

218
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,080

大约80海里朝西

我是一个搜寻小队的成员

230

231
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,029
在4英里下的海沟里

他们派机器潜艇下去探测
They sent down cameras in these little robots

来观测残骸

236
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,029
是啊
Obviously.

237
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,099
你不是来找我们的
So if you weren't looking for us,

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,049
那你是来找谁的?
then who were you looking for?

239
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,080
他

242
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,099
我不知道为什么 我从没见过她
I don't know why. I never met her.

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,039
她给了我们这个坐标
She gave us a set of coordinates.

244
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,000
我们就朝着这个
We've been conducting

245
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,069
GPS差异标进行搜索
a differential G.P.S. grid search ever since.

246
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,029
你知道这座岛?
You knew about the island?

247
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,070
岛? 这个坐标...
Island? We were given coordinates

248
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,069
在大洋的中间
in the middle of the bloody ocean.

249
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,059
我们以为收到了错位的指令
We thought it was a fool's errand...

250
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,089
直到3天前
till three days ago.

251
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,060
当我准备飞回那艘船时 突然间...
I was flying back for the ship,when all of a sudden

252
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,059
云开雾散 我看见了陆地
the clouds cleared, and I saw land.

253
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,029
仪表开始打转
The instruments started spinning.

254
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,060
我意识到飞机在下落
I realized I was going down,

255
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,060
所以我弃机跳伞了
so I grabbed my chute, and I bailed.

256
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,060
你看见她的直升机了吗?
Did you actually see her helicopter?

257
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,059
没有
No.

258
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,099
你认为我在撒谎吗  老兄?
You think I'm lying, mate?

259
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,070
我想你没有办法
I take it you have no means whatsoever

260
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,030
和你们的货船联系吧?
of communicating with that freighter of yours?

261
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,079
你叫什么名字? Sayid?
What was your name? Sayid?

262
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,000
没错
Yes.

263
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,050
不要忘了我救了你Sayid
Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.

264
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,040
你说我听了Ben说的话
So Ben...You said I'd kill him

265
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,049
就会杀了他咯?
when I heard what he's got to say.

266
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,079
-是啊     -你不给我点建议吗?
-that's right.  -Well, you wanna give me a heads-up?

267
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,080
这由不得我来说
It's not really my place to tell you.

268
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,089
你在资料上读到的...
Look, what you read in that file...

269
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,040
悉尼的那个人
about the guy in Sydney...

270
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,039
我弄错人了
I thought he was someone else.

271
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,000
我犯了个错误 我想杀的不是他
I made a mistake.I didn't mean to kill him.

272
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,040
那你想杀的是谁?
Well, who'd you mean to kill?

273
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,090
我们快到了吗?
Are we almost there?

274
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,010
快了
Almost.

275
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,010
3天之前

276
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,090
快起来John
Wake up, John.

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,050
是时候了
It's time.

278
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,020
我知道这不容易 但越快越好
I know it won't be easy,but the quicker the better.

279
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,009
你开玩笑吧?
You're kidding me, right?

280
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,000
你想要他杀了我?
You expect him to kill me?

281
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,089
John?

282
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,020
你现在犹豫是因为...
The hesitation that you're feeling

283
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,090
你认为他偷走你的肾
is just the part of you

284
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,039
是理所当然的
that still feels like he has a perfectly good explanation for stealing your kidney,

285
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,019
然后把你从8层楼摔下去
throwing you out of an 8-story window.

286
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,079
你不想解脱吗?
Don't you wanna be free from him?

287
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,060
他犹豫是因为他懦弱...
The hesitation he's feeling is because he is a spineless...

288
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,080
闭嘴!
Shut up!

289
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,090
-我需要想想       -别想了 John
-I gotta think... -Don't think, John.

290
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,019
你在浪费时间  大眼男
You're wasting your time, bug-eye.

291
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,080
我和他经历了这些
Me and him have been through all this.

292
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,040
-他要的只有他老爸...   -闭嘴  我让你闭嘴!
-All he wants is his daddy... -Shut up! I said shut up!

293
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,000
你还没想明白吗?
You really haven't figured it out yet,have you?

294
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,080
结束这一切吧John
Let go of him, John.

295
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,010
你为什么要这样对我?
Why are you doing this to me?

296
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,079
这么做是为了你自己 只要他还在喘息
You're doing this to yourself.As long as he's still breathing,

297
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,000
你就还是那个可怜悲哀的人
you'll still be that same sad, pathetic little man

298
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,069
还被旅行社赶走
that was kicked off his walkabout tour

299
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,070
因为你不能走路
because you couldn't walk.

300
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,030
这周我一直在这里John
I'll be here the rest of the week, John,

301
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,010
如果你改变了主意...
if you change your mind...

302
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,067
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

303
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:22,056
他不是我们想的那个人
He's not who we thought he was.

304
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:16,051
狗娘养的...
Son of a...

305
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:28,098
这可是个好地方啊 Locke
Nice place you got here, Locke.

306
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:32,055
Ben就在里面
Ben's inside in the brig.

307
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,094
你准备好了?
You ready?

308
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,060
是的  准备好了
Yeah, I'm ready.

309
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:00,037
你的朋友?
Friends of yours?

310
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,014
这是一艘19世纪中叶的奴隶船
It's an old slaving ship,mid nineteenth century,

311
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,057
我猜他们...
My guess is they...

312
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,038
把这些奴隶抓来
captured the slaves and brought them here

313
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,019
到这座岛上来开矿
to try and mine the island.

314
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,050
这箱子里是什么?
What's in the boxes?

315
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,098
都是炸药
That'd be dynamite.

316
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:30,094
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

317
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:34,021
你真的抓住那个杂种了?
You really kidnapped the little bastard.

318
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:40,057
我们不能杀了他 Locke
We ain't killin' him, Locke.

319
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,081
随你怎么说 James
Whatever you say, James.

320
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,065
瞧瞧啊
Well, well, well.

321
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:08,051
你干什么?!
What are you doing?!

322
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:09,066
快开门啊!
Open the damn door!

323
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,020
闭嘴!
Shut up!

324
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,056
开门啊!
Open up!

325
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:17,063
我让你闭嘴!
I said shut up!

326
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,051
你是谁?
Who the hell are you?

327
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:31,025
-这就像个无线电?     -没错!
-It's like a radio?  -It's like a radio, yes,

328
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:33,080
但我还没见过这么尖端的设备
but I've never seen equipment this sophisticated.

329
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:37,075
-但你能修好它的是吗? -希望如此
-But you can still make it work, right?  -I hope so.

330
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:41,006
那其他部分呢?
And what about the other part?

331
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:44,020
他们找到了飞机 我们全死了?
The part about they found the plane and we're all dead?

332
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,069
先别管那个
One thing at a time.

333
00:24:53,011 --> 00:24:54,074
这不是个单向音频频道
There's not a single audible channel.

334
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,090
无论是什么在干扰
Whatever that interference is,

335
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:59,091
都在阻止我们发信号出去
it's blocking our ability to send our own transmission.

336
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,030
如果...
If we...

337
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:04,083
那是什么?  无线电吗?
What's that? Is that a radio?

338
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:06,037
你们在哪找到的?
Where'd you get it?

339
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,089
在行李里
Uh, the luggage.

340
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,009
什么  你们在行李里找到了个无线电?
What, you just found a radio in the luggage?

341
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:15,086
Kate如果我说出来 你要保密
Kate, if I explain,I want you to keep this very quiet.

342
00:25:15,087 --> 00:25:18,093
保什么密?
Keep what very quiet?

343
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:23,025
Locke!快打开那该死的门!
Locke! Open the damn door!

344
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:28,040
快开门  我能听见你 你个死秃顶!
Open it up! I can hear you,you bald bastard!

345
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:34,079
Rousseau?

346
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,028
Locke

347
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:40,013
什么风把你吹到"黑岩"来了?
What brings you to "The Black Rock"?

348
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:42,065
炸药  你呢?
Dynamite. And you?

349
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:45,037
快开门!
Open this door!

350
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,035
开门啊!
Open up!

351
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:54,025
箱子就在那边
Crates are right over there.

352
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,018
快开门啊!
Open this damn door!

353
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,019
小心点  炸药很不稳定
Be careful. It's unstable.

354
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:10,086
Locke! Locke!

355
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:14,086
两天之前

356
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:24,066
很美不是吗?
It's beautiful, isn't it?

357
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:26,030
无论你在这岛上多久
No matter how much time you spend on the island,

358
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:28,030
你永远也不会厌倦这种景致的
you just never get tired of this view.

359
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:30,056
我们还没有自我介绍过
We haven't been formally introduced.

360
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,098
我叫Richard
I'm Richard.

361
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:35,029
你介意我坐下吗?
You mind if I join you?

362
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,065
当然不
Oh, sure.

363
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:45,048
他想要你难堪
He wanted to embarrass you.

364
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:46,080
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

365
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:50,036
Ben知道你不会杀了自己的亲生父亲
Ben knew you weren't gonna kill your own father.

366
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:53,031
他让整个营地的人都来看
He put you in front of everyone in our camp

367
00:26:53,032 --> 00:26:56,038
就是为了看你失败
just so they could all watch you fail.

368
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:59,033
为什么?
Why?

369
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:03,009
大家都在说
'cause when word got back here

370
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,079
一个脊柱瘫痪的人
that there was a man with a broken spine on the plane

371
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,022
突然又能走路了...
who could suddenly walk again, well...

372
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:10,038
人们开始很兴奋
People here began to get very excited,

373
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,077
因为这...
because that...

374
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:13,079
只会发生在...
That could only happen to someone

375
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,042
一个特别特殊的人身上
who was extremely special.

376
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,003
Ben不愿大家这么认为 John
Now Ben doesn't want anyone to think you're special,John.

377
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:24,094
你为什么要告诉我这些?
And why are you telling me this?

378
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:26,091
Ben在浪费我们的时间
Ben has been wasting our time

379
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:31,002
一直在钻研怀孕这件事
with novelties like fertility problems.

380
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:33,041
我们需要有人提醒我们
We're looking for someone to remind us

381
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:36,084
我们在这里是为了一个更重要的原因
that we're here for more important reasons.

382
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,088
你要我干什么?
What do you want from me?

383
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,066
我需要你找到自己的目的
I want for you to find your purpose,

384
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:43,056
然后去实施它
and to do that,

385
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:46,074
你父亲就是牺牲品 John
your father has to go, John,

386
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:49,061
你如果下不了手的话...
and since you're not going to do it...

387
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,096
我建议你找另一个人
I'm gonna suggest someone else.

388
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:04,029
Sawyer?

389
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,004
Sawyer怎么会杀了我父亲? 他甚至都不认识他
Why would Sawyer kill my father?He doesn't even know him.

390
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:09,062
读下去
Keep reading.

391
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,050
打开着该死的门!
Open this damn door!

392
00:28:15,051 --> 00:28:18,041
狗娘养的!
Son of a bitch!

393
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,084
我用枪指着你 John
I'm pointin' my gun at you, John-boy.

394
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:31,095
你只有3秒钟来打开这扇门
You got three seconds to open this door!

395
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:35,011
你不会射任何人的James
You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.

396
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:37,044
1...
One...

397
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:39,044
2!
two!

398
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:41,005
如果那枪里有子弹的话
If there were any bullets in that gun,

399
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:44,035
干嘛还要用我的刀 架着我的喉咙呢?
why would you hold a knife to my throat?

400
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:49,083
狗娘养的东西!
Son of a bitch!

401
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:52,058
看来我没白养这个蠢蛋
Guess I didn't raise no dummies.

402
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,080
-你在说什么?  -意思是那个"死秃顶"
-What the hell's that mean? -It means that "bald-headed bastard"

403
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:59,009
门外的就是我的儿子
outside the door is my son.

404
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:00,073
再说一遍
Come again?

405
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:04,096
我的儿子 我是他的父亲
My son. As in I'm his father.

406
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:06,024
你懂英语吧?
You do speak English?

407
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:08,069
你是...
You're...

408
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,035
你是怎么来到这座岛的?
How did you get here... to the island?

409
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:17,029
岛?
Island?

410
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,086
好吧
Okay.

411
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:22,042
我沿着I-10公路经过Tallahassee 突然砰的一声...
I'm driving down I-10 through Tallahassee, when bam...

412
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:26,002
有人出现在了我的后座
Somebody slams into the back of my car.

413
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:29,081
我以每小时70公里的速度撞了车
I go right into the divider at 70 miles an hour.

414
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:31,006
我知道的下一件事是...
The next thing I know,

415
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:33,038
护理人员在给我包扎
the paramedics are strapping me to a gurney,

416
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,005
在救护车里给我注射
stuffing me in the back of an ambulance,

417
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:38,081
有一个人还朝我微笑
and one of them actually smiles at me as he pops the I.V. In my arm,

418
00:29:38,082 --> 00:29:41,081
然后...什么都没有了
and then... nothing.

419
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:44,094
一片漆黑
Just black.

420
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:47,097
我在一个漆黑的房间里醒来
And the next thing I know,I wake up in a dark room

421
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:51,002
浑身被绑着  嘴里也塞了东西 当门打开
tied up, gag in my mouth,and when the door opens,

422
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:54,035
我看到了那个被我扔出窗户的人
I'm looking up at the same man I threw out a window...

423
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:57,053
John Locke

424
00:29:57,054 --> 00:30:00,073
我的死儿子
my dead son.

425
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:11,055
他"死"了是因为你把他扔出了窗户?
And he's dead 'cause you threw him out a window?

426
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:15,096
他幸存了下来 只是残废了
No, he survived that,but it paralyzed him,

427
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:18,012
永久性的
permanently.

428
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:20,029
他的死是因为他所乘坐的飞机
He's dead because the plane he was flying on

429
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,003
坠毁在了太平洋
crashed in the Pacific.

430
00:30:25,071 --> 00:30:27,067
给你一个坏消息
Well, I got bad news for you, pops,

431
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:31,017
我和你儿子在同一架飞机上
'cause I was on that plane with your son,

432
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,053
而且他根本没有残废
and he sure as hell wasn't crippled.

433
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:35,002
我们没有坠毁在太平洋
And we didn't crash in the pacific.

434
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:39,010
-我们坠毁在这座岛上    -你肯定这是一座岛吗?
-We crashed here on this island.   -You sure it's an island?

435
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,045
那还能是什么?
Well, what else is it?

436
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,088
这里比天堂可怕多了
Little hot for heaven, isn't it?

437
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:47,099
好吧  我们死了
Oh, okay, so we're dead.

438
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,046
他们在海底找到了你们的飞机
They found your plane on the bottom of the ocean.

439
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,066
1分钟前我还在车里  1分钟后
One minute I'm in a car wreck,and the next minute

440
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:56,062
我就来到了丛林当中的海盗船里?
I'm in a pirate ship in the middle of the jungle?

441
00:30:56,063 --> 00:31:00,008
如果这里不是地狱  朋友...
If ts isn't hell, friend...

442
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:02,099
那我们还会在什么地方?
Then where are we?

443
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,055
你为什么要把Locke扔出窗户?
Why did you throw Locke out a window?

444
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:13,014
他成了个讨厌的人
He was becoming a nuisance.

445
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:17,010
我骗了他一个肾
I conned him into giving me one of his kidneys.

446
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:19,082
他就一直念念不忘
He never got over it.

447
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:22,054
骗?
Conned?

448
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:24,028
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

449
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:26,077
骗
Conned.

450
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:34,010
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

451
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:36,053
-什么?  -你的名字?
-Hmm?   -Your name?

452
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:39,092
一个骗子的名字有很多
A con man goes by many names, friend.

453
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:44,050
我用过Alan Seward  Anthony Cooper  Ted MacLaren

Tom Sawyer?

456
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:52,098
我当时很年轻"HUCK FINN"又很流行...(一部动画片)
I was young, and "Huck Finn" was taken...

457
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:55,073
而且女士们都很喜欢
And the ladies loved that one.

458
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:58,035
让我更有魅力

459
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:04,058
这样?
Well, how about that?

460
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:08,031
什么这样?
How about what?

461
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:13,045
Sawyer也是我的名字
Sawyer's my name, too.

462
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:38,076
Ben发生什么事了?
Ben, what's going on?

463
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:41,045
-我们要走了     -走?去哪里?
-We're moving.  -Moving? Where are we going?

464
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:43,068
我们哪里都不去John
We are not going anywhere,John.

465
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:45,035
你要留在这里
You are going to stay behind.

466
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:48,059
还有他也是
You both are going to stay behind.

467
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,063
什么?你们不带走他?
What? You're not taking him?

468
00:32:50,064 --> 00:32:53,080
他是你留下的麻烦John 我们是不会帮你处理的
He's your mess, John. Why would we clean him up?

469
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:56,016
Ben如果你想要让我难堪...
Ben, if you're trying to put me in my place, or embarrass me...

470
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:59,078
你怎么会有这么荒唐的想法的?
Where would you get a ridiculous idea like that?

471
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:01,042
你不能离开我
Well, you can't leave me.

472
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:02,016
经过了这一切 你不能...
After everything, you can't just...

473
00:33:02,017 --> 00:33:05,094
别告诉我我不能做什么 John
Don't tell me what I can't do, John.

474
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,085
但我认为我很特别
But I thought I was... special.

475
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,056
每个人都会犯错误
Well, everyone makes mistakes.

476
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,019
我们现在就走
We're leaving now.

We'll leave a trail...one you can track. And,John,

478
00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:29,056
除非你背着你父亲的尸体回来
unless you're carrying your father's body on your back,

479
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:32,001
否则不要来打扰我们

480
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:06,073

你有没有去过Alabama的Jasper?

482
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:13,040
干嘛?

483
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:16,028
你到底有没有去过?

你和我妈妈上了床
You had sex with my mother

你父亲的反应过度又不是我的错
