前集提要
Previously on  Lost...

宫缩了
I'm having contractions.

6
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:18,055
你会没事的
You're gonna be okay.

7
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,064
有时间的话能帮我个忙吗
Do you have a second? I could use a little help here.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,083
我本来可以自己来的
Look,  I'd do it myself,

9
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,093
我是个医生  可够不到...
I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach...

10
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,031
你想让我缝那伤口吗
You want me to sew that up?

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,098
你看起来一点儿也不害怕
You don't seem afraid at all.

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,010
我不明白
I don't understand that.

13
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:39,032
他们知道我们在哪儿
They know exactly where we are.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,057
他们会来的
They're coming.

00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:44,057
你以为他们现在就该到了
You'd think they would have come by now.

16
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:46,041
看见了吗
Did anybody see that?

17
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:57,025
可怕极了
Terrific.

18
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,009
我要去找驾驶舱了
I'm gonna go out and look for the cockpit.

19
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,084
看是否能找到无线电收发机
See if we can find a transceiver

20
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:02,017
发射求救信号
to send a distress signal.

21
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:03,051
Kate  告诉我烟从哪来
Kate, you showed me where the smoke was.

22
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,034
我自己去
I can get there myself.

23
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:05,043
我要去
I'm coming.

24
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:13,019
伙计们  这算是正常吗
Hey, guys, is this normal?

25
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:14,048
白天变成了黑夜
Day turning into night,

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,011
世界末日一样的天气  伙计们
You know, end of the world-type weather? Is this...guys?

27
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:31,087
偏离了航线一千英里
We were 1,000 miles off course.

28
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,050
他们搜救我们找错地方了
They're looking for us in the wrong place.

29
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:38,096
你在洗手间里做什么
What were you doing in the bathroom?

30
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:42,097
是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

31
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:48,035
刚才发生了什么事
What the hell just happened?

32
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,094
Jack
Jack!

33
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:59,015
这是怎么搞的
How does something like that happen?

34
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,045
今晚...

35
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:05,045
他们的故事将继续...

36

38
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,038
有声吗
Anything?

39
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,093
你问个不停
You keep asking if there's anything.

40
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,076
原谅我所表露出的绝望
Pardon me for appearing desperate,

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,076
但在机长被拽出驾驶舱之前
but before the pilot was ripped from the cockpit,

42
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,064
他确实说了没有人会找到我们
he did say that no one's gonna find us

43
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:37,002
除非我们能把无线电收发机修好
unless we get that transceiver working.

44
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,006
所以
So...

45
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:39,069
有声吗
Is there anything?

46
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:42,015
好吧
Okay.

47
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,095
你当时在洗手间里做什么
So what were you doing in the bathroom?

48
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:49,032
我以为你知道
Thought you could tell.

49
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,099
我恶心了
I was getting sick.

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,045
在吐
Puking.

51
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:55,029
我对这次艰苦跋涉所做出的杰出贡献
My one tangible contribution to the trek.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,092
不  我很高兴你来了  Charlie
No, I'm glad you came, Charlie.

53
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:02,009
每个旅行都需要一个懦夫
Every trek needs a coward.

54
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,088
你可不是懦夫
You're not a coward.

55
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,048
你没事吧  先生
Are you all right, sir?

56
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:23,069

谢了
Thanks.

58
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:26,028
用我给你拿些水吗?
Can I get you a water?

59
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:28,095
没事  谢谢了
I'm fine. Thank you.

60
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,078
请吧
Please?

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,025

借过
Excuse me.

63
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:07,082
先生  等等
Sir? Excuse me!

64
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,053
先生  等等
Sir, excuse me.

65
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,079
看着点儿
Excuse me.

66
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:36,089
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentleman,

67
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,098
机长已经打开了"安全带"指示灯
the captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

68
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,056
请返回您的座位并系好安全带
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.

69
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:58,012
先生  您没事吧
Sir? Are you all right?

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,063
等一下
Just a minute.

71
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,080
请您开门
I'm gonna have to ask that you open the door.

72
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,023
快开门  先生
Open the door now, sir.

73
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,032
先生
Sir?

74
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:24,008
我在检查衣服  整理一下
Hey. We're going through some clothes. Sorting them.

75

我看能否找到你的箱子

来吧  想帮我一下吗
Come on, you wanna give us a hand?

77
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,025
不太想
Not really.

78
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,034
你在浪费时间  他们快到了
You're wasting your time. They're coming.

79
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:39,051
你男友吗
Is that your boyfriend?

80
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:48,044
我哥  Boone
My brother. Boone.

81
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:50,098
上帝赐予人类的讨厌鬼
God's friggin' gift to humanity.

82
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:01,095
我以前也有小腹的
I used to have a stomach.

83
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,065
知道性别吗
Do you know what it is?

84
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:12,025
还不知道
Not yet.

85
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:20,097
从昨天起我就感受不到胎儿在动了
I haven't felt the baby move since yesterday.

86
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,025
打扰一下
Excuse me.

87
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,013
看到我孩子了吗
Have you seen my boy?

00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:26,008
抱歉
Sorry.

出了这么多事  我是怎么和你说的
What did I tell you after what's happened?

94
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:36,048
我以为Vincent会在这附近
I thought Vincent would be around.

95
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,031
我说过让你在沙滩上呆着
Stay on the beach.

96
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,048
这离沙滩很近  我以为没事呢
I thought this would be okay.

97
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:41,057
别顶嘴
Don't do that.

98

听我的话  我是认真的  知道吗
You listen to me, I mean what I say. You understand?

停手  算了

停手 够了 别打了  够了
Break up! That's it! It's over! That's it!

106

我烦死这乡巴佬了
I'm sick of this redneck!

107

还要来试试吗  小子

告诉大家你和我说什么来着
Tell everyone what you told me!

109

告诉他们是我使飞机坠毁的  说啊

怎么回事
What is going on?

我孩子在丛林里发现了这个

从没起来过  手一直放在毯子底下
Never got up.Hands folded underneath the blanket.

116

不知什么原因  要说明的是

117
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,035
在他边上的那人却没活着
The guy next to him didn't make it.

118

非常感谢你观察我的一举一动
Thank you for observing.

119
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,070
你以为我没看到在登机前他们把你拽出去了吗
Don't think I saw them pull you out of line before we boarded?

120
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:58,019
过来  来啊
Come on! Bring it!

121
00:10:58,044 --> 00:10:59,032
停手吧
Stop!

122
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:06,037
我们找到了无线电收发机  但不好用了
We found the transceiver, but it's not working.

147
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,024
他
Him.

148
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:31,079
你不错
You're okay.

149
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:33,004
我喜欢你
I like you.

150
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:37,029
你也不错
You're okay too.

151
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,021
Hurley.

152
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,047
Sayid.

153
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:53,014
你怎么会修这东西的
How do you know how to do that?

154
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:55,048
我以前是军事通讯员
I was a communications officer.

155
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:56,056
是吗
Oh, yeah?

156
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:58,006
你看过打仗吗
You ever see battle?

157
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,052
我打过海湾战争
I fought in the Gulf War.

158
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:01,094
不是吧  我有个兄弟就参加过
No way. I got a buddy who fought over there.

159
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,040
他以前在104空降团
He was in the 104th Airborne.

160
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:07,028
你呢  空军  陆军
What were you, Air Force? Army?

161
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:09,070
共和国卫队
The Republican Guard.

162
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,053
好用了吗
Is it working?

163
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,074
看来行了
It seems to be,

164
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,041
就差找到信号了
except we're not picking up a signal.

165
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:35,058
为什么要找信号呢
Why do we need to pick up a signal?

166
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,050
我们不是要发射信号吗
Aren't we trying to send one?

167
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:38,083
是的  但要看到小格
Yes, but what you want to see here is little bars.

168
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:41,000
信号格表示无线电被接收了
The bars show it's getting reception.

169
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,029
我们需要信号格
We need the bars?

170
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,084
我们可以盲播
We could broadcast blind,

171
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:47,072
希望有人或船能收到我们的求救信号
hope that someone, maybe a ship somewhere picks up our distress call.

172
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,034
但那样可能是在浪费电池
But that would be a waste of the battery,

173
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,043
电池可不多了
which might not last for long.

174
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,031
我们还可以试一个办法
There is one thing we could try.

175
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,077
看我们是否能从高地收到信号
Get the signal from high ground.

176
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:59,010
要多高
How high?

177
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:37,022
他怎么样了
How is he?

178
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:39,064
有什么办法吗
Can you do anything?

179
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,064
拔出碎片
I can pull out the shrapnel.

180
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:44,056
可你昨天说如果要拔了出来--
But you said if you took it out...

181
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,002
我知道  但那是昨天
That was yesterday.

182
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,094
我以为他现在该在医院了
I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now.

183
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,040
如果再这样下去  他一天内就会死的
If I leave him like this he'll be dead within a day.

184
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:56,062
如果拔下来  然后止住血
If I open him up...If I can control the bleeding,

185
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,016
如果不化脓
and if he doesn't go into sepsis,

186
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
如果再能找到些抗生素
and if I can find some antibiotics,

187
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:02,041
他也许就会没事
he might be all right.

188
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,026
我要上山了
I'm going on a hike.

189
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:14,022
什么
Sorry?

190
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,068
Sayid修好了收发机  但用不了
SSayid fixed the transceiver, but we can't use it.

191
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,047
在这里用不了
Not from here.

192
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,026
Kate 等一下
Kate, wait a minute.

193
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:19,068
是你说我们必须要发射信号的
You said we had to send a signal.

194
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:21,023
你看到了那东西把机长弄成了什么样
Look, you saw what that thing did to that pilot.

195
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:22,018
恩  看到了
Yeah, I did.

196
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:27,065
为什么你认为我们在这里就比在丛林里安全呢
What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle?

197
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,099
等我  我不知道还要多久...
Wait for me. I don't know how long...

198
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:33,082
Sayid说电池不多了
Sayid said the battery won't last.

199
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:42,096
如果看到或听到什么东西
If you see or hear anything...

200
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:44,071
任何东西
Anything...

201
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,038
跑就是了
Run.

202
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:49,090
什么  那个
What, that?

203
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:57,019
什么  吃那个吗
What, eat that?

204
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,082
老兄  老兄
Dude, dude,

205
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:05,007
我是饿了
I'm starving.

206
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:08,078
可还不至于那么饿
But I am nowhere near that hungry.

207
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:13,000
不  不  谢谢了
No. No. No, thank you.

208
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,050
不吃  不了
No way. No.

209
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,060
是西班牙语漫画
The comic's in Spanish. You...

210
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,073
你懂西班牙语
...read Spanish?

211
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:38,023
不懂
No.

212
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:39,057
我找到的
I found it.

213
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,095
告诉你吧  我们回家后
Tell you what, we get home...

214
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:57,062
我再给你弄一条狗
...l'll get you another dog.

215
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:21,044
要你帮下忙
I need your help.

216
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,061
好
Okay.

217
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,090
帮我查看一下行李
Help me go through the luggage.

218
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:26,042
我需要各种处方药和药品
I need any prescription medications you find,

219
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,092
特别是以"素"和"西林"为结尾的药
especially drugs that end in "mycin" and "cillin."

220
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:30,020
那些是抗生素
Those are antibiotics.

221
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,054
用来干什么
What's this for?

222
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,019
你在干什么
What are you doing?

223
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:08,020
我想我对他太凶了
I think I was mean to him.

224
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:12,062
他是那个在门口的人
He's that guy from the gate.

225
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,070
不让我们坐我们头等舱座位的人
He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class.

226
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,079
他救了我们
He saved our lives.

227
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,084
来吧  Shannon 我们要清理些残骸
Shannon, we're trying to clear the wreckage.

228
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,009
你该帮帮忙
You should help out.

229
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,030
你在这儿无所事事的
You're just being worthless over here.

230
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,064
我什么
I'm being what?

231
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:34,047
你想让我怎么说
What do you want me to say?

232
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,006
你坐在那儿盯着尸体
You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies.

233
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:38,006
我刚遭受了打击  知道吗
I've just been through a trauma here, okay?

234
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,056
我们都遭受了打击
We've all been through a trauma.

235
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:40,090
唯一区别就是  自从失事以来
The only difference is, since the crash,

236
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:42,040
你一直在进行所谓的治疗
you've actually given yourself a pedicure.

237
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:45,036
你知道什么  那么容易就可以取笑我  你还乐此不疲
You know what? It is so easy to make fun of me, and you're good at it.

238
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,032
我倒希望不用浪费我的时间来... 
I wish I didn't have to waste ly time...

239
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,028
我希望没有理由  是的  很容易  Shannon
I wish I didn't have a reason. Yeah, it is easy, Shannon.

240
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:51,024
去你的  你根本就不知道我的想法
Screw you. You do not have the slightest idea what I am thinking.

241
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,070
我要比你清楚的多
I have a much better idea than you think I do.

242
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:54,049
不  不是
No, you don't!

243
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:57,020
好  Shannon 那你想干什么
Okay, Shannon, what are you thinking?

244
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:10,072
我要和他们一起去登山
I'm going with them on the hike.

245
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,038
是吗
Oh, yeah?

246
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:12,068
对  我这就去
Yup. I'm going.

247
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,001
不  不行  Shannon
No you're not, Shannon.

248
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,072
Shannon!

249
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,022
我要和你们一起去
I'd like to come with you.

250
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:19,006
她不去
She's not going.

251
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:20,052
才不是
The hell I'm not!

252
00:21:20,052 --> 00:21:23,006
她的糟糕决定让她的家人不快
She postures and makes really bad decisions to upset her family

253
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,036
而此时那家人就是我
which, at the moment, is me.

254
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,077
闭嘴  别耍帅了
Shut up and stop trying to be charming.

255
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,090
我和你们一起去
I'm coming with you.

256
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:30,082
这不太好吧
I don't know if that's a good idea.

257
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:33,041
你怎么回事  就比我大两岁  拜托
What are you, two years older than me? Please?

258
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,043
你要去  是吧
You're going, aren't you?

259
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,083
恩  你呢
Yeah. Are you?

260
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,019
恩
Yup.

261
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:40,020
那我去定了
Yeah, I'm definitely going.

262
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,067
谁都可以来  可现在就要出发了
Look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now.

263
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:46,046
别对她妄下断言  她人不错的
You couldn't tell from that, but she's really nice.

264
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:31,084
你决定了加入我们
You decided to join us.

265
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:35,043
我性情不定  甜心
I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.

266
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,004
在找什么
What are you looking for?

267
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:45,079
刀片什么的
Some sort of blade.

268
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,046
你儿子怎么样了
How's your son?

269
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,038
Walt吗  恩  我想他会没事的
Walt? Yeah, I think he'll be all right.

270
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:56,022
他多大了
How old is he?

271
00:23:56,051 --> 00:24:00,047
九岁  十岁
Nine. Ten.

272
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,047
十岁
Ten.

273
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:06,089
Walt最担心的就是他的狗了
Walt's more worried about his dog than anything.

274
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,069
狗在飞机上  所以...
The dog was on the plane, so...

275
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,056
小孩子  这你也知道
Kids, you know.

276
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,097
拉布拉多尔狗吗
Is it a lab?

277
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,033
恩
Yeah.

278
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,003
是吧
Yeah?

279
00:24:16,024 --> 00:24:18,020
昨天在丛林里看到过
I saw him yesterday in the jungle.

280
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:19,020
什么
What?

281
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:20,061
哪儿
Where?

282
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:22,020
那边
Over there...

283
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:24,037
大约几百码吧
A couple hundred yards in or so.

284
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,008
看起来还不错
He looked good.

285
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:50,098
是什么东西  这和跳棋一样吗
What is it, like checkers?

286
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:55,023
不太一样  这比跳棋更有趣
Not really. It's a better game than checkers.

287
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:09,054
你和你老爸玩跳棋吗
Do you play checkers with your pop?

288
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:10,075
没有
No.

289
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:13,042
我和妈妈住在澳大利亚
I live in Australia with my mom.

290
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:16,059
你没有那的口音
You have no accent.

291
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:19,009
恩  我们常搬家
Yeah, I know, we move a lot.

292
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:21,072
她生病了
She got sick.

293
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:24,014
几周前死了
She died a couple of weeks ago.

294
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,095
你这个月不顺哪
You're having a bad month.

295
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:30,035
我想是吧
I guess.

296
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:43,049
双陆棋是世界上最古老的游戏了
Backgammon is the oldest game in the world.

297
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:48,010
考古学家在挖掘美索不达米亚古代遗迹的时候
Archaeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins

298
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:50,004
就找到了很多套
of ancient Mesopotamia.

299
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,054
五千年前就有了
Five thousand years old.

300
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,042
比耶稣基督还要久远
That's older than Jesus Christ.

301
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:58,067
他们有骰子什么的吗
Did they have dice and stuff?

302
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,038
恩  但不是用塑料做的
But theirs weren't made of plastic.

303
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:04,001
他们的骰子是用骨头做的
Their dice were made of bones.

304
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:05,072
酷
Cool.

305
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,093
两名选手  两方
Two players. Two sides.

306
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:14,031
一白  一黑
One is light. One is dark.

307
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:22,057
Walt
Walt...

308
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:28,087
想知道一个秘密吗
...do you wanna know a secret?

309
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:40,017
不  多谢
No, thank you.

310
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:41,009
不  没关系
No, that's fine.

311
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:52,077
好  谢了
Okay. Thanks.

312
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:16,012
天哪
Oh, God.

313
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:18,071
我感觉到了
I just felt it!

314
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:21,050
来  摸一下  摸一下
I just... Come here, feel this!

315
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:28,051
感觉到了吗
Do you feel that?

316
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,051
看  踢了
That, right there.That's a kick!

317
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:35,023
就这儿  脚在这儿
There, right there's a foot!

318
00:27:35,077 --> 00:27:37,044
等一下  他在动
Oh, my God, wait,he's moving around.

319
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:41,032
他  他
He. He.

320
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,049
我想你是个男孩子
I guess I think you're a he.

321
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,000
好了  开阔地带
Okay. Wide open space.

322
00:27:57,012 --> 00:27:58,083
你该试一下无线电  看看好用不
Check the radio, see if we're good.

323
00:27:58,096 --> 00:28:00,071
在这里不会收到的
We're not gonna have reception.

324
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,059
就试试吧
Just try it.

325
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:03,009
我不想浪费电池
I don't want to waste batteries.

326
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:05,051
我没说让你一天都开着
I'm not asking to keep it on.

327
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,001
我们还是被山挡着
We're blocked by the mountain.

328
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:08,063
就试一下该死的无线电
Check the damn radio!

329
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:10,076
如果我试一下  到用的时候我们可能就...
We might not have any juice left when we get to...

330
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:22,057
天
Oh, my God.

331
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,036
什么鬼东西
What the hell's that?

332
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:26,036
有东西来了
Something's coming.

333
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:30,087
我看是向咱们来的
Coming towards us.

334
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:33,053
来吧  我们走
Come on, let's move.

335
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,054
我不该来的
I shouldn't have come on this hike!

336
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,076
Sawyer
Sawyer!

337
00:28:40,076 --> 00:28:41,096
别管他
Let him go!

338
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,045
那是...
That's...

339
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,028
那是一只大熊
That's a big bear.

340
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,058
会是它杀了机长吗
You think that's what killed the pilot?

341
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,041
不是
No.

342
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:23,071
不  它和那东西相比就是小巫见大巫了
No, that's a tiny, teeny version compared to that.

343
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:28,026
伙计们  这不光是一只熊
Guys, this isn't just a bear.

344
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:32,076
还是一只北极熊
It's a polar bear.

345
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,078
你确定他昏过去了吗
You sure he's out?

346
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:46,028
你怎么知道你拔出来那东西的时候他不会醒
How do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?

347
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:47,096
我不知道
I don't.

348
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:54,013
嗨 伙计 你醒了没
Hey, guy, you awake?

349
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:59,014
看那  救援飞机来啦  我们得救啦  好唉
Yo! There's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yay!

350
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:01,093
恩  他昏了
Yeah, he's out.

351
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:06,047
那你想让我...
So, what do you want me...?

352
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:08,077
他不太可能会恢复意识
It's unlikely he'll regain consciousness,

353
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:10,018
但可能他会因疼痛而醒来
but the pain might bring him around.

354
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,098
如果这样  你就要按住他
If it does, hold him down.

355
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:21,028
我不太善于和血打交道哦  哥们儿
Uh... I'm not so good around blood, man.

356
00:30:22,045 --> 00:30:23,058
那就别看
Then don't look.

357
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:25,083
恩  可是...
Yeah. But...

358
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:28,092
我不太善于和血打交道哦
I'm not so good around blood.

359
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:31,000
尽全力好了  好吗
Just do the best you can, okay?

360
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:39,018
别看
Don't look.

361
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:40,095
好
Okay.

362
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:57,007
老兄
Dude.

363
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:00,028
把止血带给我
Hand me those strips.

364
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,003
老兄
Dude.

365
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:02,095
把止血带给我  我要把血止住
Just hand me the strips. I need to get this bleeding stopped.

366
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:04,054
我看我做不来
I don't think I can.

367
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,025
怎么  怎么回事
What? What's going on?

368
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,066
把止血带给我
Just hand me the strips.

369
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:08,087
给我
Give it to me.

370
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,012
想都别想  Hurley
Don't even think about it.

371
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:11,096
想都别想 Hurley
Don't even think it. Hurley, hey!

372
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,079
该死
Damn it.

373
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:17,067
不会是北极熊吧
That can't be a polar bear.

374
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:19,013
是北极熊
It's a polar bear.

375
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:20,001
等一下
Wait a minute.

376
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:21,080
北极熊可不是住在丛林里的
Polar bears don't live in the jungle.

377
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:23,018
说的就是
Spot-on.

378
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,064
不  北极熊不会住在这么远的南部
No. Polar bears don't live this far south.

379
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,085
这只就是
This one does.

380
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:29,027
曾经是  曾经
Did. It did.

381
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:31,035
那东西哪来的
Where did that come from?

382
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,048
可能是熊村吧  我怎么会知道
Probably Bear Village. How the hell do I know?

383
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:36,094
不是熊  是枪
Not the bear, the gun.

384
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:40,053
在一具尸体上找到的
I got it off one of the bodies.

385
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:41,051
一具尸体
One of the bodies?

386
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:42,091
对  一具尸体
Yeah, one of the bodies.

387
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,041
飞机上不允许带枪
People don't carry guns on planes.

388
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,049
美国执行官就可以带啊  美人儿
They do if they're a U.S. Marshal, sweet cheeks.

389
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:47,087
飞机上就有一把
There was one on the plane.

390
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,075
我看到一个脚踝有配枪的人躺在那儿
I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster,

391
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,063
所以我就拿了枪
so I took the gun,

392
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,025
想也许用得着
thought it might come in handy.

393
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,046
看看怎么样
Guess what,

394
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:57,026
我刚干掉一只熊
I just shot a bear.

395
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:00,001
那你怎么知道他是执行官
So why do you think he's a marshal?

396
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:01,063
因为他有一个别针别住的警章
Because he had a clip-on badge!

397
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,068
我也拿了  觉得很酷
I took that too. Thought it was cool.

398
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:05,060
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

399
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,001
你是犯人
You're the prisoner.

400
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:09,089
你在美国执行官身上找到了一把枪
You found a gun on a U.S. marshal?

401
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:11,010
恩  我相信是那样
Yes, I think you did.

402
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:14,019
你知道位置  因为他要把你押到美国
You knew where it was because he was bringing you back to the States.

403
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,040
那些手铐是在你身上的
The handcuffs were on you.

404
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:16,073
所以你才知道有把枪在那儿
That's how you knew.

405
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:17,030
滚
Piss off!

406
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,090
这才是你本来面目  你个混蛋
That's who you are, you son of a bitch.

407
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:20,065
咱们互相怀疑
Be as suspicious of me as I am of you.

408
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,074
你是犯人
You are the prisoner.

409
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:23,011
行  我是罪犯
Fine, I'm the criminal.

410
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,041
你是恐怖分子
You're the terrorist.

411
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:25,066
我们都可以扮演个角色
We'll all play a part!

412
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:27,012
你想当什么
Who do you wanna be?

413
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,012
有谁知道怎么用枪吗
Does anybody know how to use a gun?

414
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,075
扣一下扳机就行了
I think you just pull the trigger.

415
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:36,067
别用枪
Don't use the gun.

416
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:38,096
我想把它卸开
I want to take it apart.

417
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:41,084
枪把下有一个钮
There's a button on the grip.

418
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,001
推一下  弹夹就会弹出来
Push that, it will eject the magazine.

419
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:46,068
枪膛里还有一发子弹
There's still a round in the chamber.

420
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:52,010
按住那钮  拉枪的上面
Hold the grip, pull the top part of the gun.

421
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:06,020
我了解你这一类型
I know your type.

422
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:08,099
我看不是吧
I'm not so sure.

423
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,091
恩  我和你这样的女孩子打过交道
Yeah, I've been with girls like you.

424
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:16,029
没有女孩子和我一模一样
Not girls exactly like me.

425
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:38,036
要给您加满吗
Can I get you a refill?

426
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:42,007
不  不用了  多谢
I'm fine with this, thank you.

427
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:44,007
先生  您呢  需要些什么吗
You, sir, can I get you anything?

428
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,016
鸡尾酒  汽水
Cocktail, soda?

429
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,091
就咖啡吧  甜心  黑咖啡
Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.

430
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:50,041
咖啡  好的
Coffee, sure.

431
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:55,046
你看起来忧心忡忡啊
You look worried.

432
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,021
我要是你也会这样
I'd be worried too, I was you.

433
00:33:58,063 --> 00:34:00,067
但你要乐观点儿  孩子
But you gotta stay positive, kiddo.

434
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:04,055
还是有机会他们会相信你的故事的
There's always that off-chance that they'll believe your story.

435
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:06,097
我知道我就相信
I know I sure do.

436
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:09,089
我不在乎你相不相信
I don't care what you believe.

437
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:11,039
这倒是真的
Oh, I know that's true.

438
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,064
一向如此
That has always been true.

439
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:19,011
你真的不再要些果汁吗
You sure you don't want some more juice?

440
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:25,015
恩  不要了
Yeah, I'm sure.

441
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:47,093
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentleman,

442
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:51,030
机长已经打开了"安全带"指示灯
the captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

443
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,056
请返回您的座位并系好安全带
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.

444
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:01,002
我求你帮个忙
I have one favor to ask.

445
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:02,036
真的吗
Really?

446
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,082
看来不错
This oughta be good.

447
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,069
我们该继续前进了
We should keep moving.

448
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:41,096
不
No.

449
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:51,051
她在哪儿
Where is she?

450
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,022
谁
Who?

451
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:14,028
现在倒想检查无线电了
Oh, now's a good time to check the radio.

452
00:37:14,036 --> 00:37:16,032
这之前干嘛去了
Not before, but now.

453
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:17,083
我们的地势高点儿了
We're up higher.

454
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,033
是啊  可不是吗
Yes, we are.

455
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:30,059
有一个信号格了
Bar. Hey, we've got a bar!

456
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:36,018
呼救  呼救
Mayday, Mayday!

457
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,014
是什么
What is that?

458
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,097
什么的反馈  什么东西会那么做
From what? What would do that?

459
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:41,072
不知道
I don't know.

460
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:42,073
我告诉你是什么东西--
I'll tell you what.

461
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:44,014
这家伙不是在修无线电
This guy not fixing the radio.

462
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:46,044
那东西都不好用了
The thing doesn't even work.

463
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,048
不  不  没坏
No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken.

464
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:57,016
我们发送不了是因为有其他的信号已经在发送了
We can't transmit because something else is already transmitting.

465
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:58,016
从哪儿传来的
Transmitting from where?

466
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:00,037
附近的某个地方  信号很强烈
Somewhere close. The signal's strong.

467
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,087
附近的某个地方
Somewhere close?

468
00:38:02,004 --> 00:38:03,079
就是说在这岛上  好极了
On the island? That's great!

469
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,004
也许是其他的幸存者
Maybe it's other survivors.

470
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,033
我们飞机上的吗  他们怎么--
From our plane? How would they...

471
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,071
这是什么样的传输信号
What kind of transmission is it?

472
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:09,004
也许是卫星电话或无线电信号--
It could be a sat phone, maybe a radio signal.

473
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:10,000
能听吗
Can we listen to it?

474
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:11,063
让我先找到频率  等下
Let me get the frequency first. Hold on.

475
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,057
根本没有发射信号
There's no transmission.

476
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,047
闭嘴吧
Shut up!

477
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,038
是救援队  一定是
The rescue party, it has to be.

478
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:20,081
是法语  说的是法语
French. The French are coming!

479
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:23,014
听到法语我从没这样高兴过
I've never been so happy to hear the French.

480
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:25,006
我没学过法语  她在说什么呢
I never took French. What is she saying?

481
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:27,019
有人懂法语吗
Does anyone speak French?

482
00:38:27,035 --> 00:38:28,031
她懂
She does.

483
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:30,031
不  我不懂  什么啊
No, I don't. What?

484
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,044
你在说什么啊  你在巴黎住了一年啊
What the hell are you talking about? You spent a year in Paris!

485
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,065
是喝酒  不是学习
Drinking! Not studying!

486
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:39,020
重复1-7-2-9-4-5-3-1...
Iteration 1-7-2-9-4-5-3-1.

487
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:40,045
是什么
Okay, what's that?

488
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,024
不
Oh, no, no, no.

489
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:43,091
电池快没了
Batteries are dying.

490
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:45,018
我们还有多少时间
How much time do we have?

491
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:47,067
我听你说过法语  你就听一下
I've heard you speak french. Just listen to this.

492
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,021
听一下
Listen.

493
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:51,009
你到底懂不懂法语  因为那会很关键
Do you speak French, because that would be nice.

494
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:54,021
重复1-7-2...
Iteration 1-7-2...

495
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:55,059
那声音好怪异  是什么呢
That voice is weird. What is that?

496
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:57,030
快  快
Come on, come on.

497
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:02,085
它在重复
It's... It's repeating.

498
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,010
她说的对
She's right.

499
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:06,015
什么
What?

500
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,035
是一个循环
It's a loop. "lteration."

501

重复  在重复相同的信息
It's repeating the same message.

502
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:11,019
是一个计数器
It's a counter. Iteration...

503
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:15,069
下组数字将以5-3-3结束

504
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:18,095
...9-4-5-3-3

505
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,062
谁知道他到底在说什么吗
Does anyone know what he's talking about?

506
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,004
是信息重复次数的计数器
It's a running count of the number of times the message has repeated.

507
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:26,058
大概是30秒一次  就是说...
It's roughly 30 seconds long, so...

508
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:28,083
多久呢
How long...?

509
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:31,038
别忘了翻译  老大
Don't forget to carry the one, chief.

求你们来救我
Please, come get me.

514
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:45,031
或者不是  你甚至都不懂法语
Or she's not! You don't even speak French!

515
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:46,041
让她听
Let her!

516
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:47,031
闭嘴  哥们儿
Shut up! Man

他们都死了
They're dead.

523

你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

531
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,062
重复
The iterations.

532
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:47,087
是一个求救信号

还有人被困在这里吗
Someone else was stranded here?

537
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:10,056
也许有人来救他们
Maybe they came for them.

538
00:41:10,073 --> 00:41:13,069
如果有人来过  为什么还在播放
If someone came, why is it still playing?

539
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:21,090
伙计们
Guys...

540
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:25,078
我们这是在哪儿
where are we?
