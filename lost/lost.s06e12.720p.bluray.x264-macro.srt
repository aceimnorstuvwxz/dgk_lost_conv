- Doctor?  - I'm sorry. She just wandered off.

144
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,640
离什么群?
Wandered off from where?

145
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,890
Hugo 我说的每一件事
Everything that I said, Hugo,

146
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,270
都是认真的
I meant it.

147
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,950
抱歉打扰
Forgive us.

148
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,950

圣罗莎精神健康研究所

149
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,250

圣罗莎精神健康研究所

150
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,420
好了 我们走
All right, let's go.

151
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,320
夜幕降临前 我们得坐上船
We have to make it to the outriggers

152
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,020
- 穿过海峡 到"九头蛇"岛去  - 你弄到炸药了?
- and across the channel to Hydra Island before nightfall.  - You have the dynamite?

153
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,470
弄到四根...
Four sticks...

154
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,900
足够毁掉机舱驾驶室和所有仪器
Enough to destroy the cockpit and all the instruments.

155
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,560
这样一来 飞机就报废了
That plane'll never fly.

156
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,310
呃 我觉得这个办法不妥
Um, I don't know if that's a good idea.

157
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,540
我是说 这东西极不稳定
I mean, for one thing, that stuff's really unstable.

158
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,850
你得相信我 为这事 我早已训练良久
You have to trust me. I've been training my whole life for this.

159
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,870
- 就为炸东西?  - 为了保护你们
- To blow stuff up?  - To protect you.

160
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,960
嗯 但是炸了飞机 还怎么保护我们?
Yeah, but how is blowing up the plane protecting us?

161
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,370
没有飞机
With that plane gone,

162
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,850
- 那怪物就不能离岛了  - 对 但我们也离开不了啊
- that thing won't be able to leave the island.  - Yeah, well, neither will we,

163
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,470
于是我们只能和它一起被困在这儿
and then we'll be stuck here with it,

164
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,970
- 它会找我们麻烦的啊  - Jacob说 Richard知道该怎么做
- and it'll be angry at us.  - Jacob said Richard would know what to do.

165
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,380
- Richard说炸掉飞机 对吧?  - 没错
- And Richard said to blow up the plane. Correct?  - Yes.

166
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,780
可是 Jacob从来没这么跟我说过
Well, Jacob never said anything about it to me.

167
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,530
我是说 万一Richard说错了呢?
I mean, what if Richard's wrong?

168
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,860
Hugo 我是为你们着想 为了你们所有人
Hugo, I'm looking out for your best interests, all of you.

169
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,300
没什么比这更重要的了
Nothing is more important than this.

170
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,160
那东西是恶魔
That thing is evil,

171
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,500
上帝弄出这个岛 就是为了帮我们 因为...
and God help us if it ever leaves this island, because...

172
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,550
离地约六英尺
About six feet off the ground.

173
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,600
是要削根矛?
That gonna be a spear?

174
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,280
我也不确定 James
I'm not sure what it's gonna be yet, James.

175
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,810
如果削得差不多了 这东西会告诉我的
When the time is right, it'll tell me.

176
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,110
- 你现在跟木头谈起话来了?  - Sawyer
- You talk to wood now?  - Sawyer.

177
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,880
怎么了?
What?

178
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,620
要我为你俩做啥事么?
Something I can do for you two?

179
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,010
你能做什么? 把一切都搞定 如何?
Is there something you can do? How about anything?

180
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,500
岛那头的混蛋抓住了Jin
Those bastards on the other island grabbed Jin.

181
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,240
我们却坐在这里浪费时间
We're just sitting around twiddlin' our damn thumbs,

182
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,260
无动于衷
doin' nothin' about it.

183
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,170
无动于衷和耐心等待 是有区别的
There's a difference between doing nothing and waiting.

184
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,330
那我们在等什么?
So what are we waiting for?

185
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,970
你们回岛上来的唯一条件
You were only able to come back to this island

186
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,740
就是所有人同心协力
because you all did it together.

187
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,990
如果我们想登机离开
If we're gonna get on that plane and leave,

188
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,740
也必须这样做
it has to happen the same way.

189
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,800
我们等其他朋友来这儿回合 Kate...
We're waiting for your friends to get here, Kate...

190
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,550
比如Hugo Sun Jack...
Hugo, Sun, Jack...

191
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,220
只有这样
That's the only way

192
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,230
我们才能离开这个荒岛
we're ever getting off this godforsaken rock.

193
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,550
- 我可不看好这事  - 那我们走着瞧吧
- Well, I don't see that happening.  - Well, let's just hope you're wrong.

194
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,180
你去哪儿了?
Where you been?

195
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,040
我能单独和你谈谈么?
Can I speak to you in private?

196
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,590
当然可以
Absolutely.

197
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,940
一切顺利吧?
Everything go all right?

198
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,460
嗯
Yes.

199
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,930
Widmore见了你?
Did Widmore see you?

200
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,280
- 没 但他手下见了  - 你没杀掉他们?
- No, but his people did.  - And you let them live?

201
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,490
我没有杀他们的理由
I didn't see the point of killing them

202
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,070
- 毕竟我有事在身  - 那你弄清楚了他们藏在潜水艇上的东西 是什么吗?
- when I had what I came for.  - So you found what they were hiding in the submarine?

203
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,170
一清二楚
I most certainly did.

204
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,270
现在怎么办?
Now what?

205
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,460
我们得去多找些炸药 否则她就死得没意义了
We get more dynamite or else she died for nothing.

206
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,190
或许她的死 就是在暗示我们 别碰那些该死的炸药
Maybe she died to show us to stay the hell away from dynamite.

207
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,320
Jack 我倒乐意冒一冒这个险
Well, Jack, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

208
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,510
Richard 我答应过要带她离岛的
Richard, I promised I'd get her off this island.

209
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,450
Jack 我... 我希望你别这么做
Well, Jack, I... I wish you hadn't done that.

210
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,400
- 如果这样能让你好受些的话 你可以把责任全推到我身上  - 我认为Richard是对的
- If it makes you feel any better, you can blame it on me.  - I think Richard's right.

211
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,990
这是我们唯一的选择
It's the only choice we've got.

212
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,990
相信我 Jack
Trust me, Jack.

213
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,410
好吧
Okay.

214
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,590
好 我们走
Good. Let's get moving.

215
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
38号? 38号在吗?
38? Number 38?

216
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,100
Reyes先生!
Mr. Reyes!

217
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,270
真是太荣幸了
What an honor.

218
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,770
给我一个全家桶
Give me a bucket, family size.

219
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,280
没问题 马上就好 先生
Of course. Right away, sir.

220
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,990
41号?
41?

221
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,730
41号在吗?
Number 41?

222
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,460
看什么看?
What?

223
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,310
抱歉
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,170
我们以前见过吗?
Have I seen you before?

225
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,650
我是这儿的老板 可能你看过我的广告吧
I own the place. Maybe you saw my commercial.

226
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,670
莫非你想要一个"咯咯鸡"钥匙扣?
You want a clucketeer keychain?

227
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,700
不... 不 不是说那个
N... no. It's not that.

228
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,060
你坐过大洋航空的815次航班吗?
Were you on Oceanic flight 815?

229
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,810
- 大概一星期前 从悉尼来的那个?  - 呃 没错
- A bout a week ago, from Sydney?  - Uh, yeah.

230
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,760
- 我也是  - 哇 真巧啊
- So was I.  - Wow. What a coincidence.

231
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,510
是啊 反正我也在等着叫号 介意我跟你坐一会儿吗?
Yeah. Listen, you mind if I join you while I wait for my order?

232
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,080
请吧
Be my guest.

233
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,920
哦 好多鸡啊
Ooh. That is a lot of chicken.

234
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,940
- 每当沮丧的时候 我就狂吃一顿  - 啊 她叫什么名字?
- I eat when I'm depressed.  - Ah. So what's her name?

235
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,930
前两天我相亲的时候 遇到了一个姑娘
I met a girl on a blind date the other night.

236
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,970
是不是... 是不是与你想象的大相径庭?
And you didn't...  It didn't go how you'd hoped?

237
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,260
她美若天仙
She was totally awesome,

238
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,590
除了一点以外... 她疯了
expect for one thing...  she's crazy.

239
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,230
哥们 所有女人都有点疯狂的
Well, all women are a little bit crazy, brother.

240
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,940
不 她是真的疯
No. This one actually lives in the looney bin.

241
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,870
我看到了那个面包车 上面全是疯子
I mean, I saw the van. She's full-on nuts.

242
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,020
她才清醒了点儿
I mean, she started sane,

243
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,540
但紧接着 她就对我说 我们以前就认识...
but then she told me that we already knew each other...

244
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,140
至于这事么? 我有同感
And that? I'd remember.

245
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,340
跟我说说...
Tell me something...

246
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,730
她说她认识你的时候 你相信她吗?
Did you believe her when she said she knew you?

247
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,710
是的
Yeah.

248
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,520
有一点吧
Kinda.

249
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,590
你得跟着感觉走
You know, I say go with your gut.

250
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,980
或许你应该...
You know, maybe you should...

251
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,360
在对她绝望之前 你应该找到
you should try to find out where she thinks she knew you from

252
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,770
你们相识的那个地方
before you give up on her.

253
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,570
42号? 42号在吗?
42? Order 42?

254
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,750
啊 到我了 哥们
Ah, that's me, brother.

255
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,380
很高兴碰到你
It was nice bumping into you.

256
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,380
你好
Hello.

257
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,560
你好
Hello.

258
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,180
很抱歉Sayid把你绑了起来
I'm sorry Sayid tied you up,

259
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,220
- 他是怕 你在我们交谈之前就跑了  - 我不怪他
- But he was afraid you'd run before we had a chance to talk.  - I don't blame him.

260
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,150
虽然在他离开之前 我已经解释过了
Although as I explained to him before he left,

261
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,820
我无处可逃啊 哥们
I have nowhere to run to, brother.

262
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,190
这大概是我所听过的
Well, if that's not the best argument against captivity

263
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,760
最佳脱困词了吧
that I've ever heard,

264
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,970
再也找不出比这更好的了
I don't know what is.

265
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,390
我能问你几个问题吗 Desmond?
You mind if I ask you a couple questions, Desmond?

266
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,110
问吧
Not at all.

267
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,130
为什么Charles Widmore把你带回岛上来?
Why did Charles Widmore bring you back to the Island?

268
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,940
我是被绑的那个
Considering I was kidnapped,

269
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,280
你还是问他吧
you'd have to ask him.

270
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,130
他们全副武装地带着他
They had him under armed guard.

271
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,790
他把我扔进了一间木屋
He threw me into a wood shack

272
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,410
然后对我进行强力电磁场实验
and blasted me with a massive amount of electromagnetism.

273
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,040
希望你不介意我这么问 Desmond
If you don't mind my asking, Desmond,

274
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,870
你怎么知道 他对你做的实验是什么?
how can you be sure what it was that he blasted you with?

275
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,210
经验
Experience.

276
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,070
你知道我是谁吗?
Do you know who I am?

277
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,780
当然
Of course.

278
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,440
你是John Locke
You're John Locke.

279
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,350
回到扎营的地方 我马上回来
Head back to camp. I'll be back soon.

280
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,080
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

281
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,900
Desmond和我要去散散步
Desmond and I need to take a walk.

282
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,430
我要给你看点东西
Something I'd like to show you.

283
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,850
又让你若有所思了 是吧?
Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?

284
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,150
那是什么?
What's that?

285
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,750
Ilana啊
Ilana.

286
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,110
她就在这儿
There she was,

287
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,370
Jacob挑出来的
Handpicked by Jacob,

288
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,980
专门训练来保护你们这些接班人的
Trained to come and protect you candidates.

289
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,520
一旦她告诉你 你是谁的话
No sooner does she tell you who you are,

290
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,520
她就炸死了
then she blows up.

291
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,880
这座岛就随之玩完了
The Island was done with her.

292
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,530
所以我很想知道 如果由我们来做的话 会发生什么事情
Makes me wonder what's gonna happen when it's done with us.

293
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,670
好了 各位 这可能得花几分钟时间
All right, everyone. This might take a few minutes.

294
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,990
除了我以外 我不想让任何人来碰触这些炸药
I don't want anyone but me handling that dynamite,

295
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,020
所以我要一个人进去 Hugo在哪儿?
so I'm gonna go in alone. Where's Hugo?

296
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,760
- 我还以为他在你前面  - 快跑!
- I thought he was up front with you.  - Run!

297
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,250
快跑!
Run!

298
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,970
快跑啊!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

299
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,490
你干嘛要这么干啊?!
Why the hell did you do that?!

300
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,820
我是在保护大家啊
I'm protecting us.

301
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,040
- 你究竟在想什么啊?!  - 冷静点
- What the hell were you thinking?!  - Calm down.

302
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,500
- 现在该怎么办... 现在我们怎么办?  - 别说了 够了
- Now what... what are we supposed to do now?  - That's it. That's enough.

303
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,860
我们死定了 我们都死定了
We're dead. We're all dead.

304
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,580
至少该提前给声警报啊 Hugo
A warning might have been nice there, Hugo.

305
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,500
我说了"跑"的嘛
I did say "run."

306
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,010
为什么你要那么干?
Why'd you do that?

307
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,890
Michael让我这么干的
Michael told me to.

308
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,340
谁?
Who?

309
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,340
Michael啊
Michael.

310
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,400
有些死者 会回来冲我大喊大叫
He's one of the people who come back

311
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,110
他就是其中之一
and yell at me after they die.

312
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,630
他让我阻止大家
He told me I had to stop everyone

313
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,750
去炸掉飞机
from blowing up the plane.

314
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,350
所以... 没有炸药了 也就没有爆炸了
So... no dynamite, no more blowing up.

315
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,580
经常发生这事吗
That happen a lot,

316
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,450
死人对着你吼叫?
dead people yelling at you?

317
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,030
经常发生
It happens enough.

318
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,250
你就听从他们所说的了?
And you just listen to whatever they say?

319
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,260
死人比活人更可靠
Dead people are more reliable than alive people.

320
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,500
有什么可以帮你的吗 Reyes先生?
How can I help you, Mr. Reyes?

321
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,970
我想向你打听一下几天前的那个姑娘
I wanted to ask you about that girl the other day.

322
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,010
叫Libby的那个?
Libby?

323
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,360
我能不能见见她
I was wondering if maybe I could see her.

324
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,880
我觉得可能不行
Well, I don't think that's a good idea.

325
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,570
她不太舒服
She's not well.

326
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,890
显然 如果只是去
Clearly, she's well enough

327
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,180
比如... 吃个墨西哥鸡肉卷 她不会有事的
for, like, a... Fajita field trip.

328
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,570
那是我的错
Well, that's my mistake.

329
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,850
我对她的情况判断失误了
I misjudged her condition.

330
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,830
她的情况?
Her condition?

331
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,920
她认不清现实
She has issues with reality.

332
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,910
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

333
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,330
我只是觉得 你现在见她
I just think it probably wouldn't be a good idea

334
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,310
可能不太妥当
for you to see her right now.

335
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,150
这只会让她更糊涂
It'll only confuse her.

336
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,430
你说了"可能"
You said "probably,"

337
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,590
就是说 可能会有例外喽
which means you might make an exception.

338
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,860
或许家属就没问题吧
Well, perhaps for family.

339
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,690
抑或是一个慷慨的捐赠者?
Or a generous donor?

340
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,240
什么?
I'm sorry?

341
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,790
我进来的时候 发现娱乐室很简陋啊
The rec room looked pretty gnarly on my way in.

342
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,510
你觉得十万块能买些什么呢?
What do you think 100k might buy?

343
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,000
你记起来了?
You remembered?

344
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,550
没有
No.

345
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,320
对不起
I'm sorry.

346
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,420
那你为什么来这儿?
Then why are you here?

347
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,200
你是在什么地方认识我的?
Where is it you think you know me from?

348
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,510
呃 我不知道
Um, I'm not sure.

349
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,100
我知道这有点讲不通
I know it won't make sense.

350
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,070
我...
I...

351
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,780
说说看嘛
Try me.

352
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,250
几天前 我正在看电视
A few days ago, I was watching TV,

353
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,660
看到了你的一则广告
and one of your commercials came on.

354
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,200
就在我看到你的那一瞬间
And the moment that I saw you,

355
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,070
我的脑袋就像是被敲了一下
It was like I was hit over the head.

356
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,360
我生活中的所有这些回忆
All these memories

357
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,120
一下次全涌现出来了...
came washing back... of my life,

358
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,430
只是... 这全然是...
Only... it was...

359
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,850
另外一种生活
another life.

360
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,450
什么样的回忆?
What kind of memories?

361
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,020
一架飞机失事了
There was a plane crash.

362
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,640
接着...
And...

363
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,080
我在一座岛上
I was on an island.

364
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,420
我也在那儿?
And I was there?

365
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,760
是的 我们就... 互相认识了
I think so. We... knew each other.

366
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,350
我们...
We...

367
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,080
喜欢上了对方
liked each other.

368
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,730
当我到那儿的时候
And then when I got here,

369
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,390
就好像我曾经来过这儿
it was almost like I'd been here before.

370
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,080
不知道为什么 Hugo
And for some reason, Hugo,

371
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,290
我记得你也来过这儿
I have a memory of you being here, too.

372
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,640
呃...
Um...

373
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,850
我是第一次来精神病院
This is the first time I've ever been in a mental hospital.

374
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,000
是 我知道 但你在我的脑海中挥之不去
Yeah, I know. But I can't get you out of my brain.

375
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,960
所以那晚我见到你的时候 我非得和你说会儿话
That's why the other night when I saw you, I had to talk to you,

376
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,790
因为如果你记得我的话...
because if you remembered me...

377
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,810
我也希望这样 Libby 但是...
I wish I could, Libby, but...

378
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,440
我没印象
I can't.

379
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,480
对不起
I'm sorry.

380
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,830
没关系
It's okay.

381
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,410
没关系
It's okay.

382
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,050
我疯了
I'm crazy.

383
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,190
可能是吧
Yeah, probably,

384
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,570
但... 我们都得到了一些东西 对吧?
But... we all got something, right?

385
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,370
我是说 去和一个陌生人说
I mean, it takes a lot of guts

386
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,850
你在一个奇异的平行世界里 认识他们
to go up to a total stranger and tell them you know them

387
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,990
是需要胆量的
from some Bizarro alternate universe.

388
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,310
我害怕和女孩子打招呼
I'm scared just saying "hi" to a girl.

389
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,100
你做得不错
You're doing fine.

390
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,330
嘿 你能...
Hey, can you ever, like...

391
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,130
离开这儿吗?
get outta here?

392
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,820
比如一天 或者...
On a day pass or...

393
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,120
是的 我是自愿来这儿的
Yeah. I'm here voluntarily.

394
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,840
好吧...
Well...

395
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,200
你想做点...
Would you like to...

396
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,900
什么吗?
do something?

397
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,210
你是说...
You mean...

398
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,150
约会?
a date?

399
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,630
嗯...
Uh...

400
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,130
是的
Yeah.

401
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,610
我愿意
I'd love that.

402
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,170
想一下 Desmond...
Remind me, Desmond...

403
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,850
你在舱底下面 按那个按钮按了多久啊?
How long were you down in that hatch, pushing that button?

404
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,460
三年
Three years.

405
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,490
现在你能又来到这里 那就更不简单了
And here you are, back for more.

406
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,680
要是我不清楚内情的话 我肯定会说这座岛与你有关
If I didn't know better, I'd say this island has it in for you.

407
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,230
你清楚内情吗?
Do you know better?

408
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,410
什么?
Excuse me?

409
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,790
我没有什么特别的 哥们
Well, there's nothing special about me, brother.

410
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,290
这座岛和我们大家都有关
This island has it in for all of us.

411
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,260
是的 没错
Yes, it does.

412
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,140
怎么了?
What?

413
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,820
那是谁?
Who's that?

414
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,970
别理他
Just ignore him.

415
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,440
- 你认识那个男孩吗?  - 我说了别理他
- Do you know that boy?  - I said ignore him.

416
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,310
你要去哪儿?
Where you going?

417
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,740
Ben 在达摩组织的营地...
Ben, back at the Dharma barracks...

418
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,180
还有手榴弹吗? 炸药呢?
there's still grenades there? Explosives?

419
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,050
- 是的 我想有吧  - 那我们就去那儿
- Yes, I think so.  - Then that's where we're going.

420
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,700
或许我们该谈一谈吧
Maybe we should talk about this a minute.

421
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,700
谈一谈? 没时间谈了 但如果你知道
Talk? There's no time to talk, but if you know

422
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,750
我们该做什么 如果你知道 我们除了把飞机炸毁以外
what we need to do, if you know how we stop that thing

423
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,890
还有别的方法 可以离开这座岛的话
from leaving the island without blowing that plane up,

424
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,990
- 那就让我们听听 让所有人都听听  - 我知道我们该做什么
- Then let's hear it. Let's all hear it.  - I know what we need to do.

425
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,990
真的? 是什么?
Really? What's that?

426
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,520
我们必须去找Locke谈谈了
We have to go talk to Locke.

427
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,070
你是想要我们大家去送死吗?
Are you trying to get us killed?

428
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,610
这不是我主意 是他提出来的
It's not my idea. It's his.

429
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,370
Jacob说 我们必须去找Locke谈谈
Jacob says we have to talk to Locke.

430
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,980
Jacob现在在这里吗?
Jacob's here right now?

431
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,720
是的
Yeah.

432
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,990
去问问他 这个岛是什么
Ask him what the island is.

433
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,260
你说什么?
What?

434
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,550
前段时间 Jacob曾经告诉过我这个岛是什么
A while back, Jacob told me what the island was,

435
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,010
如果现在他真的就在我身边
and if he's really standing here right next to me,

436
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,770
那就问问他呗
then just ask him.

437
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,220
Richard 我没有向你证明的必要
I don't have to prove anything to you, Richard.

438
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,810
你要么就跟我来
You either come with me

439
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,460
要么就继续去搞炸药
or you can keep trying to blow stuff up.

440
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,630
哥们 你自己决定吧
Your call, dude.

441
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,430
他在撒谎
He's lying.

442
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,220
Jacob不可能告诉我们该去做什么的
Jacob isn't telling us what to do

443
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,240
因为这不是他的风格
because Jacob never tells us what to do.

444
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,730
我还是把话说明白些吧...
I'm gonna make this simple...

445
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,200
如果那个东西离开了岛 那么什么都结束了
If that thing leaves the island, that's it.

446
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,100
- 这... 这一切都玩完了  - 什么结束了?
- It... it's over.  - What's over?

447
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,940
所有的一切 我会竭尽所能地
Everything. I'm destroying that plane,

448
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,530
去毁掉那架飞机的
and I can use all the help I can get.

449
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,810
谁跟我一起去?
Who's coming with me?

450
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,210
我
I am.

451
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,720
我之前见过它 哥们 可它没说话
I saw that thing in action, man. It doesn't want to talk.

452
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,590
对不起
Sorry.

453
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,950
还有别人吗?
Anyone else?

454
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,170
Richard 对不起
Sorry, Richard.

455
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,100
如果Jacob让我们去跟Locke谈 我们就得那么去做
If Jacob says we go talk to Locke, we go talk to Locke.

456
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,600
我会和Hugo一起的
I'm going with Hugo.

457
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,940
真的?
Really?

458
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,340
不要挡在我们前面
Don't get in our way.

459
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,140
好吧 Hurley
All right, Hurley.

460
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,150
我们去和Locke谈谈吧
Let's go talk to Locke.

461
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,000

我们做错了吗?

462
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,100
可能是
Probably.

463
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,990
那么 你觉得我们到那儿以后...
So what do you think we should...

464
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,730
应该对Locke说些什么呢?
say to Locke when we get there?

465
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,190
我的意思是...
I mean...

466
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,990
我们该如何跟这个烟怪开口说话呢?
how do you break the ice with the smoke monster?

467
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,010
不用为这个担心
Don't worry about it.

468
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,250
直觉告诉我 他会主动说话的
Something tells me he's gonna do most of the talking.

469
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,850
或者 他会把我们一杀了之
Or he could just kill us all.

470
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,710
是的 他也可能会那么做
Yeah, he could.

471
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,280
我在那里没有看到Jacob
I didn't see Jacob back there.

472
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,130
呃 我那么说 仅仅是想让大家听从我
Uh, I just said it because I wanted everyone to listen to me.

473
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,580
我知道的
I know.

474
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,600
那你为什么还跟我一起来?
Then why'd you come with me?

475
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,610
自从Juliet离我们而去
Ever since Juliet died,

476
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,490
自从她因我而死
ever since I got her killed,

477
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,990
我只想弥补这一切
all I've wanted was to fix it.

478
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,730
但是我办不到
But I can't.

479
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,160
我什么都弥补不了
I can't ever fix it.

480
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,700
你根本无法想象 我坐在那里
You have no idea how hard it is for me to sit back

481
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,460
听任他人吩咐 会有多么难受
and listen to other people tell me what I should do.

482
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,280
但我觉得可能这个是个转折点吧
But I think maybe that's the point.

483
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,560
可能...
Maybe...

484
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,970
可能我应该放手了
Maybe I'm supposed to let go.

485
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,800
除非你的放手 让我们俩都去送死
Unless you letting go gets us killed.

486
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,990
去见Locke是我的主意
Going to see Locke was my idea,

487
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,680
不是Jacob的
not Jacob's.

488
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,310
Hurley 你让我相信你
Hurley, you asked me to trust you.

489
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,600
我就相信你
This is me trusting you.

490
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,890
哎 哥们 或许这是福不是祸
Well, it's a good thing you do, dude,

491
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,160
因为我也不知道该怎么走
beause I have no idea where I'm going.

492
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,010
等等 别紧张 我知道这声音是怎么回事的
Wait. It's cool. I think I know what these things are.

493
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,400
喔 是吗? 这到底是什么玩意儿?
Oh, yeah? What the hell are they?

494
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,180
在这里等着
Wait here.

495
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,150
嘿 你在这里吗?
Hey. You around?

496
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,600
Michael呀?
Michael?

497
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,810
你被困在这个岛上了 对不?
You're stuck on the island, aren't you?

498
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,200
我罪有应得
Because of what I did.

499
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,780
还有...
And...

500
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,400
其他人也在这里...
there are others out here...

501
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,000
像你一样的 对吧?
like you, aren't there?

502
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,950
那些声音就是这样来的?
That's what the whispers are?

503
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,300
是的
Yeah.

504
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,110
我们只能待在这儿了
We're the ones who can't move on.

505
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,250
你知道Locke在哪里吗?
Do you know where Locke is?

506
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,810
在那边
There.

507
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,570
谢谢你
Thanks.

508
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,200
有...
Is...

509
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,070
有什么事我可以帮得上忙吗?
is there anything I can do to help you?

510
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,120
保住你自己的小命儿吧
Don't get yourself killed.

511
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,850
好的
Okay.

512
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,560
呃
Mm.

513
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,680
Hurley 帮我这个忙吧?
And, Hurley?

514
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,670
如果你有机会再见到Libby的话...
If you ever do see Libby again...

515
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,980
代我向她道歉
tell her I'm very sorry.

516
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,840
哥们 你就放心吧
I'll be sure and do that, dude.

517
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,650
我弄到了大概六种不同的芝士
I got, like, six different kinds of cheeses.

518
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,320
我不知道它们具体不同在哪儿
I don't even know what they are,

519
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,160
但是 是老板娘向我推荐的 所以就...
but the lady at the store said they were good, so...

520
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,390
我想既然所有人都爱吃芝士
I figured you'd like cheese

521
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,380
你也肯定不例外吧
because everybody likes cheese.

522
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,620
有啥事不对劲吗?
Is something wrong?

523
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,980
没 没有 只是...
No, not wrong, just...

524
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,700
走神了
Off.

525
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,870
你有来过这里吗?
Have you been here before?

526
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,740
没
No.

527
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,890
只是... 和你一起在这里 这个场景让我感到非常熟悉
It's just... being here with you feels so familiar.

528
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,460
像是一场梦中的约会
It's like a date we never had.

529
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,940
哇 听起来我像是完全疯了 对吧?
Wow. I sound completely insane, don't I?

530
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,840
没有
No.

531
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,460
只是有那么点而已
Not completely.

532
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,790
你为什么会想和我在一起?
Why do you even wanna be with me?

533
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,410
你为什么想和我在一起?
Why you wanna be with me?

534
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,620
你说什么?
What?

535
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,560
拜托
Come on.

536
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,530
看着我
Look at me.

537
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,480
我想和你在一起...
I want to be with you...

538
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,360
是因为我好喜欢你
because I like you.

539
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,770
是这样呀 但是...
Yeah, but...

540
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,200
你喜欢我 是因为...
you like me because...

541
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,830
呃 因为你有... 妄想症
well, you're... delusional.

542
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,960
怎么? 怎么了?
What? What's wrong?

543
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,670
哇哦
Whoa.

544
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,360
- 天呐  - 怎么了?
- Dude.  - What?

545
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,980
我...
I...

546
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,250
我想 我记起来一些事情了
I think I'm remembering stuff.

547
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,180
真的?
You are?

548
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,860
你是说我没有疯掉?
You mean I'm not crazy?

549
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,930
不 我才不觉得你疯了
No, I don't think you are.

550
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,230
我们到了
We're here.

551
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,290
那是什么?
What is it?

552
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,050
是口井
It's a well.

553
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,640
让我猜猜看...
Let me guess...

554
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,730
你现在是在想 这井会有多深
You're wondering how deep it is.

555
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,860
你真聪明
You read my mind.

556
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,680
Desmond 你可以看出这口井 建成有多久了吗?
You have any idea how old this well is, Desmond?

557
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,830
非常久了?
Very old?

558
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,250
没错 的确非常久了
That's exactly right. Very old.

559
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,730
事实上 这口井古老到
So old, in fact,

560
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,540
是挖井人
that the people who dug this well

561
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,270
单单用手挖成的
did it completely by hand.

562
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,880
天知道他们挖了多久
God knows how long it took 'em.

563
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,270
呃 假如仅仅是为了享受点井水 这样做未免太夸张了
Well, it seems like a lot of work just to get some water.

564
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,090
喔 他们不是为了井水
Oh, they weren't looking for water.

565
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,870
他们是在寻找答案
They were looking for answers.

566
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,560
很久以前
A long time ago,

567
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,250
比如我们现在站的这个地方
places like the one we're standing at right now

568
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,310
能让罗盘的指针旋转
made compass needles spin.

569
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,360
那些有罗盘的人
And the people holding the compasses

570
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,070
想知道指针为什么会转
needed to know why,

571
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,010
然后他们就开始挖掘
so they dug.

572
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,530
他们有找到答案吗?
Did they find what they were looking for?

573
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,080
没有 他们没有找到
No, they didn't.

574
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,820
Desmond 我之所以把你带到这里 看这口井
The reason I wanted you to see this, Desmond,

575
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,000
是因为Charles Widmore
is because Charles Widmore

576
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,330
他根本不在乎答案
is not interested in answers.

577
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,770
他只在乎权力
He's only interested in power.

578
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,760
他把你带回到这个岛上
And he brought you back to this island

579
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,190
是希望你能帮他 找到他所需要的东西
so that you could help him find what he's looking for.

580
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,030
毕竟 这不是唯一的井
After all, this isn't the only well.

581
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,650
这个就是
And that's the reason

582
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,450
你想让我看这口井的原因吧?
you wanted me to see this?

583
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,640
你为什么一点都不害怕呢?
Why aren't you afraid?

584
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,760
你说什么?
Excuse me?

585
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,680
你在这里
You're out here,

586
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,990
在丛林的中央
middle of the jungle,

587
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,460
只有我在你身旁
with me.

588
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,660
世上再没别人知道你在这里
Not a person on earth even knows you're here.

589
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,530
你为什么一点都不害怕?
Why aren't you afraid?

590
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,090
怕了又能怎样?
What is the point in being afraid?

591
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,040
啊!
Aah!

592
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,400
我们的朋友怎么样了?
How is our friend?

593
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,730
无需再挂虑他了
We don't have to worry about him anymore.

594
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,450
你去哪里了?
Where you been?

595
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,290
我就是去散了散步 James
I went for a walk, James.

596
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,220
既然你愿意走动了 或许你可以...
Well, now that you've stretched your legs, maybe you can...

597
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,160
这个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

598
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,870
呃... 嗨
Um... hey.

599
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,870
你好 Hugo
Hello, Hugo.

00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,520
哥们 虽然我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are, dude,

601
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,970
或者你想要什么
or what you want,

602
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,550
但 我们必须和你谈谈
but we have to talk to you.

603
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,690
"我们"?
"We"?

604
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,890
还有另外一些人跟着我呢
There are other people with me.

605
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,220
目前的情况是
But the thing is,

606
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,360
你我都拥有武器
you got weapons, and we got weapons,

607
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,250
而我不想有任何人受伤...
and I don't want anyone to get hurt...

608
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,940
或是遇害
or killed.

609
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,760
所以我们不会采取任何行动
So we're not gonna do anything,

610
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,160
我希望你能向我保证 你也不会采取任何行动
and I want your word that you're not gonna do anything either.

611
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,790
我向你保证
You have my word.

612
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,870

Okay, guys.
