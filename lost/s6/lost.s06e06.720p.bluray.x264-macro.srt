"迷失" 前情提要...
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,560
就是你这个混蛋 杀了我孩子
You're the son of a bitch who shot my kid.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,550
把他抬起来 送去泉水那里
Pick him up. Get him to the spring.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,480
你在帮倒忙! 快淹死他了!

我什么秘密都没有 你干嘛这样对我?
I don't have any secrets. Why are you doing this?

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,550
啊!
Aah!

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,880

- Poison.  - Why would you people wanna kill Sayid?

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,300
他体内有股暗黑势力 正在滋长
There is a darkness growing in him.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,700
一旦到达心脏 你曾经的朋友
And once it reaches his heart, everything your friend once was

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,320
就会消失了

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,900
你有什么事瞒着我?
What are you hiding from me?

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,280
那药是毒药 他们想借我的手杀了你
The pill was poison. They wanted me to kill you.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930

The meter doesn't stop until you get out, pal.

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,820

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,450
Sayid叔叔 你从澳大利亚 给我们带了什么礼物?
Uncle Sayid, what did you bring us from Australia?

31
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,280
去我的包里看看 在沙发那儿
Go look in my bag. It's on the couch.

32
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,710
你能回来真好 Sayid 他们想死你了
It's good you came, Sayid. They've missed you.

33
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,850
他能现身 就不错了...

环球旅行者结束了异国之旅

35

为一家石油公司做合同翻译
Translating contracts for an oil company

36
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,120
算不上什么异国之旅... 而且极其枯燥
is hardly exotic... And it's painfully dull.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,910
干洗生意... 做起来也是有一定风险存在的
There's... there's a little adventure in the world of dry cleaning.

38
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,770
他只是在谦虚而已 Omer刚开了家新店

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,120
我以为我们以前说过 吃饭的时候 不接电话
I thought we talked about cell phones at the dinner table.

41
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,350
先吃到这里吧 有事
Dinner is over. This is business.

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360

嗯
Yes.

45

我想跟你谈谈

51
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,260
解什么惑?
Answers to what?

52
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,870
我们从那台机器开始说起
Let's start with that machine.

53
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,000
你们把我绑在这东西上
You hooked me up to this thing,

54
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,330
还扎了我几针
you stuck needles in me,

55
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,180
你说这是一个测试
and you called it a test.

56
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,790
各人心中一杆秤
For every man, there is a scale.

57
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,190
秤的一边 是善
On one side of the scale, there is good.

58
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,240
另一边... 是恶
On the other side... evil.

59
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,680
这台机器告诉我们
This machine tells us

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,660
秤的平衡度如何
how the scale is balanced.

61
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,650
而你的秤...
And yours...

62
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,810
倾斜向了错误的一边
tipped the wrong way.

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,340
这就是你要毒死我的原因?
And that's why you tried to poison me?

64
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,020
没错
Yes.

65
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,810
我觉得 你死了会比较好
I think it would be best if you were dead.

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,770
你以为你了解我 实际上大错特错
You think you know me, but you don't.

67
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,040
我是个好人
I'm a good man.

68
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,060
所以 如果你想杀我... 啊!
So if you're trying to kill me... Uhh!

69
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,280
你走吧
Go.

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,930
离开这儿
Leave this place.

71
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,840
别回来了
Never come back.

72
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,940
你准备好了么?
Are you ready?

73
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,550
为什么让我去?
Why does it have to me be?

74
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,790
我是说 你可以让Sawyer或Jin或...
I mean, you could send Sawyer or Jin or...

75
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,070
- 自己去做  - 如果我可以自己解决的话
- do it yourself.  - If I could do it myself,

76
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,470
我不会来找你 Claire
I wouldn't be asking you, Claire.

77
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,120
如果我去的话
If I go in there,

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,640
我必须确保 你能实践诺言
I need to know you'll do what you said.

79
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,050
我要找回我的儿子
I want my son back.

80
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,110
我会信守诺言的
I always do what I say.

81
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,040
你会伤害他们吗?
Are you gonna hurt them?

82
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,200
我只会对那些不听话的人下手
Only the ones who won't listen.

83
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:52,200

迷失 第6季第6集

84
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:06,277
是我
It's me.

85
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,927
- 冷静点儿  - 你要干嘛?
- Calm down.  - What are you doing?

86
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,367
现在是凌晨2点半
It's 2:30 the morning.

87
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,057
Sayid 我有麻烦了
Sayid, I'm in trouble.

88
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:23,247
什么麻烦?
What kind of trouble?

89
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:27,867
第二家店 我是借钱开的
I borrowed money to open the second store.

90
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,137
但...
But...

91
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:33,627
我不是从银行借的
I didn't borrow it from the bank.

92
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:35,277
我还完钱后
I paid the loan back,

93
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,067
债主却...
but the man who lent me this money...

94
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,887
他说 我还欠他每个月的利息没还...
He says I still owe him interest every month...

95
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:43,737
我的店开多久 就得按月支付他多久的利息
for as long as I own my business.

96
00:08:44,477 --> 00:08:45,887
如果你缺钱 我可以借给你...
If you need money, I'll lend it to you...

97
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:47,377
我不需要钱 Sayid
I don't need money, Sayid.

98
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:51,987
我要你去说服这些人 别再来找我的麻烦
I need you to convince these people to leave me alone.

- "Convince" them?  - Sayid, don't forget who you're talking to.

100
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:57,077
我知道你打仗的时候做过什么
I know what you did in the war.

101
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:02,097
你曾是共和国卫队的审讯官

102
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:07,567
我知道你的底细
I know what kind of man you are.

103
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,457
如果你以为
If you think I'm going to hurt someone

104
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,497
光凭你商业决策失误 我就会去害人...
just because you made a bad business decision...

105
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:14,547
听我说 这不光是我一个人的麻烦!
Look, this is not about me!

106
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:17,847
我们毕生的储蓄... 全没了 Sayid 什么都没了
Our life savings... it's all gone, Sayid. All of it.

107
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:19,247
我们可能连房子都保不住
We could lose our home.

108
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:20,847
拜托了
Please.

109
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:26,377
听着... 我知道你很在乎Nadia
Look... I know you care about Nadia.

110
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,537
如果你还在乎我们... 在乎她...
If you care about us... about her...

111
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,377
你会去的 Sayid
you will do this, Sayid.

112
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,417
抱歉
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:43,187
我早已脱胎换骨了
I'm not that man anymore.

114
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:04,967
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

115
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,037
我要走了
I'm leaving.

116
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:08,707
他们赶我走
I've been banished.

117
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,867
赶你走? 为什么?
Banished? For what?

118
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:14,257
很明显 我是个不祥之人
Apparently, I'm evil.

119
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,437
这些人说 我最好一死了之...
These people say I'm better off dead...

120
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:17,907
虽然这听上去让人不敢置信
Which is surprising,

121
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:20,817
毕竟是他们救了我一命
considering they were the ones who saved my life.

122
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:24,427
呃 事实上 你不是他们救活的 他们...
Well, actually, they're not. They...

123
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,717
他们试过要救你 但...
They tried to save you, but...

124
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,787
你最后还是死了 兄弟
you were dead, man.

125
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,237
死了2个小时
For two hours.

126
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,877
相信我 当... 当... 当你坐起来的时候
Trust me, when... when... when you sat up,

127
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:38,947
他们跟我们一样吃惊
they were just as surprised as the rest of us.

128
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:44,327
不管究竟是什么把你救活的 反正不是他们
So whatever brought you back, it wasn't them.

129
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:48,827
别动
Hold it.

130
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,007
停! 别开枪!
Stop! Don't shoot her!

131
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:00,387
你来这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

132
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:02,907
他想见你
He wants to see you.

133
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:05,347
说英文
Speak English.

134
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:10,897
谁想见我?
Who wants to see me?

135
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:12,577
你知道是谁
You know who.

136
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:16,737
如果他想见我 叫他自己来
If he wants to see me, then tell him to come in.

137
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,537
不 他要你去找他
No, he wants you to go to him.

138
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:20,607
他就在墙外面等着
He's waiting outside beyond the outer wall.

139
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:21,517
我不傻
I'm not a fool.

140
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,687
如果我走出这所寺庙...
If I step outside this temple...

141
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,397
他就会杀了我
he'll kill me.

142
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:31,457
嗯 那你也许该派个 他不会杀的人去
Well, then maybe you should send someone he won't kill.

143
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:35,027
拦住她!
Stop her!

144
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,997
把这个女孩关到山洞里去 事情解决后再说
Put the girl in the hole until this is resolved.

145
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,887
立刻带Shephard和Reyes去我房间
Then bring Shephard and Reyes to my room immediately.

146
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:43,717
啊 那有点儿困难
Ah, that's gonna be a little difficult.

147
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,277
他们失踪了
We can't find them.

148
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:49,057

快去找!

149
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:51,807
走!
Come on!

150
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:01,537
跟我来
Come with me.

151
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:04,677
我以为你希望我离开这儿
I thought you wanted me to leave.

152
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,297
事情有变
Things have changed.

153
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,827
你的朋友... Shephard和Reyes...
Your friends... Shephard and Reyes...

154
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,877
你知道他们去哪儿了吗?
do you know where they went?

155
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,587
不 我不知道
No, I don't.

156
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:36,427
Claire为什么在这儿?
Why is Claire here?

157
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,327
她说的话是什么意思?
And what was she talking about?

158
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,917
她被一个愤怒的人
She's a confused girl,

159
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,257
迷惑了
under the influence of an angry man.

160
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:48,277
谁?
What man?

161
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,487
多年来
For years,

162
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,267
他受困于此
he has been trapped.

163
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,617
但现在Jacob去世了
But now Jacob's gone.

164
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,237
他就自由了
He's free.

165
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:03,927
这个人 不摧毁岛上的一切生灵
This man will not stop until he has destroyed

166
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:07,607
是不会罢休的
every living thing on this island.

167
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,747
他是恶魔的化身
He is evil incarnate.

168
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,257
你想让我去和他交涉?
And you want me to speak to him?

169
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:15,317
不
No.

170
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,727
我希望你干掉他
I want you to kill him.

171
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,847
他会扮成你认识的某人...
He will come to you as someone you know...

172
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,197
死去的某人
Someone who has died.

173
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,037
你一见到他...
As soon as you see him...

174
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:35,337
就把这个深深插进他的胸口
plunge this deep into his chest.

175
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:38,217
如果你等他开口说话之后
If you allow him to speak,

176
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,667
那就来不及了
it is already too late.

177
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,037
自打我来到这里
Since I've been here,

178
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:47,357
你们淹我 打我 折磨我
I've been drowned, beaten and tortured at your hands.

179
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:50,637
我为什么还要帮你做事?
Why would I ever do anything for you?

180
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:55,507
你自己说 你是个好人
You said that there is still good in your soul.

181
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:00,607
那就证明给我看
Then prove it.

182
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:07,809
嘿 等等我!
Hey, wait up!

183
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:09,759
Sayid叔叔 你会待多久?
How long are you staying, Uncle Sayid?

184
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,579
还待几天
Just a few more days.

185
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:16,449
我得去多伦多...
I have to go to Toronto...

186
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:18,299
工作
to work.

187
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,449
我们喜欢你在这里
We like it when you're here.

188
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,799
是的 妈妈也喜欢
Yeah, and mommy likes it, too.

189
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,509
好的 乖乖的
Okay. Be good.

190
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:49,949
Sayid啊!
Sayid!

191
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,569
Omer啊!
Omer!

192
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,099
我的丈夫还好吗?
Is my husband going to be all right?

193
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:04,339
我们马上就给他动手术
We're taking him into surgery now.

194
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,609
- 他的肺被刺穿 并伴有大出血  - 到底怎么回事 你知道吗?
- He's suffered a punctured lung and some internal bleeding.  - Do you know how this happened?

195
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,129
急救队认为 他遇到了劫匪
E.M.T.s think he was mugged.

196
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:11,289
他的情况一稳定下来 我立即通知你们
I'll come get you as soon as he's stable.

197
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:15,899
- Sayid! 你去哪儿?  - 待在这里陪Omer
- Sayid! Where are you going?  - Stay here with Omer.

198
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,469
这不是打劫 对吧?
This wasn't a mugging, was it?

199
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,739
不管你想干什么...
Whatever you're thinking of doing...

200
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:23,969
别那么做
don't do it.

201
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:27,449
我不想你那样
I don't want you to.

202
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:29,679
求你了... 就...
Please... Just...

203
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:30,989
回家吧
go home.

204
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,659
去等孩子们
Wait for the kids.

205
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:35,569
让他们感受到安全 Sayid
Make them feel safe, Sayid.

206
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:38,909
行吗?
Will you do that?

207
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,049
嘿?
Hello?

208
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,409
是Sayid?
Sayid?

209
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:57,169
你好 Kate
Hello, Kate.

210
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,269
你要走吗?
Are you leaving?

211
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,319
我也不是很确定
I am not exactly sure.

212
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:06,419
我错过了什么?
What'd I miss?

213
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:07,989
问Miles吧
Ask Miles.

214
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,279
谢谢
Thank you.

215
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:35,119
哇
Wow.

216
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,439
很高兴见到你 Miles
It's good to see you, too, Miles.

217
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,149
Sawyer让你回来打包 是吧?
Sawyer sent you packing, huh?

218
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,579
我也想跟他走
I thought about going after him, too.

219
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,299
但是 呃 我知道 我要是不回来
But, um, I knew he'd just end up berating me

220
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,059
他会一直骂我
until I turned around and came back.

221
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,029
发生了很多事情吧?
That pretty much what happened?

222
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:58,549
很多
Pretty much.

223
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:00,759
呃...
Well...

224
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,839
欢迎归队
Welcome back to the circus.

225
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,179
- 这里发生了什么事?  - 呃 我想下...
- What's going on in here?  - Well, let's see...

226
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,429
噢 那个澳大利亚小妞回来了
Oh, that Australian chick's back.

227
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:09,609
等下 什么?
Wait. What?

228
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,899
你知道的 那个... 那个金发的... 有过孩子的小妞
You know, the... the blonde... one that had the baby.

229
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,129
是Claire?
Claire?

230
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,319
对的 Claire
Right. Claire.

231
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,819
她几个小时前刚回来的
She just strolled in here a couple hours ago,

232
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,459
举止怪异
acting all weird.

233
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,869
不过 还是很辣
Still hot, though.

234
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,509
Miles 她在哪?
Miles, where is she?

235
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,589
她在哪?
Where is she?

236
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,479
你好 Sayid
Hello, Sayid.

237
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,849
你为什么要这么做?
Now why'd you go and do that?

238
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,689
你想拿回它?
You want it back?

239
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,699
拿着 我不吃人
Take it. I won't bite.

240
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,259
你是什么东西?
What are you?

241
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,669
呃 Sayid 你好像有所耳闻
Well, Sayid, you seem to have some idea about that,

242
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,109
所以连招呼都不打
considering that you stabbed me in the chest

243
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,069
就直接刺我胸口
without even saying hello.

244
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,599
他们跟你说了什么?
What did they tell you?

245
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,499
他们说你是恶魔的化身
They said you were evil incarnate.

246
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,669
我为你感到悲哀
I feel sorry for you.

247
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:32,609
为什么?
Why?

248
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:35,909
Dogen... 让你来这儿的那个人...
Dogen... the man who sent you out here...

249
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,819
知道你根本杀不了我
knew that you had no chance of killing me.

250
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,809
而且他认为 你一旦动手 我就会杀了你
And he believed that I would kill you if you tried.

251
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,309
而且这不是他第一次
And this wasn't the first time that

252
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,879
借刀杀人 对吧?
he tried to get someone else to do it for him, was it?

253
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,529
嗯
No.

254
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,399
那你这么容易就信他的话 真悲哀
Then shame on you for being talked into it so easily.

255
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,829
那你想让我信你什么?
And what is it you are trying to talk me into?

256
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:00,819
什么?
Sorry?

257
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,539
你没杀我
You haven't killed me.

258
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,219
很明显 你有目的
Clearly, there's something you want.

259
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,219
我只想让你带个口信儿 仅此而已
I just want you to deliver a message, that's all.

260
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,049
你怎么不让Claire传话?
Then why didn't you just have Claire deliver it?

261
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:12,679
因为你才有说服力
Because it would mean a lot more coming from you.

262
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,459
Sayid 如果你能帮我的话...
Sayid, if you'll do this for me...

263
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,338
要是我告诉你 你能得到一切你想要的东西呢?
What if I told you that you could have anything you wanted?

264
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:31,118
要是我告诉你 你能得到这世上任何东西呢?
What if I said you could have anything in the entire world?

265
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:37,068
那我就会说 我唯一想要的人
I would tell you that the only thing I ever wanted

266
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,908
死在了我怀里
died in my arms.

267
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:44,658
我永远都见不到她了
And I'll never see it again.

268
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,528
但要是你能呢?
But what if you could?

269
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:07,778
哦...
Uh...

270
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,498
出了点小意外
We had an unfortunate incident

271
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,018
被飞去来器打成这样的
involving a boomerang.

272
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:17,498
是我的错
My apologies.

273
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:23,448
孩子们什么时候睡的?
Oh, what time did the kids go to bed?

274
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,678
大概两小时前
About two hours ago.

275
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:29,298
你怎么跟他们说的?
And what did you tell them?

276
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:30,988
爸爸出了点意外
Daddy had an accident,

277
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,198
但他不会有事的
but that he's going to be fine.

278
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,508
他还在术后恢复中 但是...
He's still recovering from surgery, but...

279
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:40,968
他现在醒了
he's awake now.

280
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:48,098
他告诉你借贷的事了?
Did he tell you about the loan?

281
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:49,328
听着 我有钱
Look, I have money.

282
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,188
不
No.

283
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,918
这是Omer的过错
This is Omer's responsibility.

284
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:56,338
他得自己承担责任
He brought this on himself.

285
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,398
你为什么不想跟我在一起?
Why didn't you want to be with me?

286
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:12,858
Sayid 你把我的照片一直带在身上
You carry my picture around with you, Sayid.

287
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,798
你要是关心我
If you care about me,

288
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,888
为什么还把我推向你哥哥?
why did you push me towards your brother?

289
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:30,428
在过去的12年里
For the last 12 years,

290
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,378
我一直试着洗净双手...
I've been trying to wash my hands...

291
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,338
洗净我做过的丑事
of all the horrible things I've done.

292
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:41,628
我不能跟你在一起...
I can't be with you...

293
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,978
因为我不配得到你
because I don't deserve you.

294
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:09,588
发生了什么事?
What happened?

295
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,958
丛林里有个男人...
There is a man in the jungle...

296
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,318
在往南大约一英里的
about a mile south of us,

297
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:18,878
围墙边上
by the outer wall.

298
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,098
他让我回来捎个口信
He sent me back here to give you a message.

299
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,888
他想让你们知道 Jacob已经死了
He wants you to know that Jacob is dead.

300
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,038
因为他死了
And because he's gone,

301
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:31,628
你们也没必要再待下去了
none of you have to stay here any longer.

302
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,838
你们自由了
You're free.

303
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:35,248
我碰到的这个人
The man that I met

304
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:37,678
马上就要永远地离开这个岛
is leaving the island forever.

305
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:40,698
想要跟他走的
And those of you who want to go with him

306
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:43,068
就离开寺庙 跟他一起走
should leave the temple and join him.

307
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,578
日落前 做出决定吧
You have until sundown to decide.

308
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:49,238
要是日落时 我们留下来呢?
What happens at sundown if we stay?

309
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:51,708
那就只有死路一条
You die.

310
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:02,798
嘿!
Hey!

311
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:06,588
你什么时候回来的? Ford和Kwon跟你在一起吗?
When did you get back? Are Ford and Kwon with you?

312
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:07,698
Claire在哪?
Where is Claire?

313
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,838
好吧 我需要你先回答我的问题...
Okay, I need you to tell me what I need to know before I...

314
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,368
我问你 Claire在哪?
I said, where is Claire?

315
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:16,468
好吧 先放开我 行吗?
All right. Just let go of me, okay?

316
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:24,948
给你两分钟
You have two minutes.

317
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:26,788
# ... 褪色 #
# ... fade away #

318
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:30,798
# 抓住一颗陨星 放进你的口袋 #
# Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket #

319
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:33,608
# 下雨天再拿出来 #
# Save it for a rainy day #

320
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:38,218
# 因为爱会来轻触你肩 #
# For love may come and tap you on the shoulder #

321
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,488
# 星稀的夜晚 #
# Some starless night #

322
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,128
- Claire吗?  - # 它们就在... #
- Claire?  - # They are just in... #

323
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:51,158
Claire 是我
Claire, it's me.

324
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:52,618
Kate吗?
Kate?

325
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:55,708
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

326
00:24:56,968 --> 00:24:58,458
我... 简直不敢相信你在这儿
I... I can't believe you're here.

327
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:01,388
他们也抓你了?
Did they capture you, too?

328
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:03,128
不 没有 他们...
No. No, they...

329
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:05,958
为什么他们把你关在下面?
Why did they put you down here?

330
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:07,988
发生什么事了?
What happened?

331
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:10,178
Kate 他们抓了我儿子 他们抓了Aaron
They have my son, Kate. They have Aaron.

332
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:11,628
- 他们把他从我身边带走  - 不 不
- They took him from me.  - No. No.

333
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:14,338
Claire 他们没抓Aaron
Claire, they don't have Aaron.

334
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,148
是我带走他的
I took him.

335
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:19,448
我...
I...

336
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:20,598
什么?
What?

337
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:22,148
我把他带出了岛
I took him off the island.

338
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,888
那时你走了 我们找不到你
You were gone, and we couldn't find you.

339
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:26,878
所以...
So...

340
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:29,638
我养了他
I raised him.

341
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:33,428
还有...
And...

342
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:37,268
他是最动人 最美丽的小男孩
He is the most beautiful, amazing little boy.

343
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,398
然后我回来救你
But I came back here to rescue you

344
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:41,878
这样你就可以和他在一起
so that you could be with him,

345
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:44,878
这样你们就可以又相聚了
so that you guys could be together again.

346
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:48,728
Kate 我不需要你救
I'm not the one that needs to be rescued, Kate.

347
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:50,968
时间到 走吧
Time's up. Let's go.

348
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:52,918
别! 别! 等一下!
No! No! Wait!

349
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:55,688
- 别! 等等! 等一下!  - 你都见到她了
- No! Wait! Wait!  - You wanted to see her.

350
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:56,608
那就走吧
So let's go.

351
00:25:58,408 --> 00:25:59,518
Kate 他来了
He's coming, Kate.

352
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,308
他来了 他们阻止不了他!
He's coming, and they can't stop him!

353
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:13,623
大家伙儿 冷静点儿! 没事儿的
Eeverybody, calm down! It's going to be okay.

354
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:15,303
别! 别! 等一下!
No! No! Wait!

355
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:16,303
等会儿!
Hang on!

356
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:17,753
嘿!
Hey!

357
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,883
嘿 你制造了恐慌 我们的人都打算走了
Hey, you created a panic here. Our people are leaving.

358
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:23,513
别人请我来捎个口信而已
I was asked to deliver a message,

359
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:24,693
受人之托 忠人之事
and that's what I did.

360
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:27,013
你的人干什么 全由他们自己
What your people do now is up to them.

361
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,063
Cindy 等等嘛 你们在这儿会很安全
Cindy, just wait. You're all safe here.

362
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,263
我们只要待在寺庙里 他就碰不到我们
As long as we stay in the temple, he can't touch us.

363
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:35,333
你听见他说的了 Jacob死了
You heard him. Jacob's dead.

364
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,133
如果这里不安全了
And if it isn't safe here anymore,

365
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:38,653
我们就不能冒险留下
we can't take that risk.

366
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,783
大家听着!
Everyone, listen!

367
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,683
这是造谣!
This is a bluff!

368
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:47,903
他进不来! 他进不来的!
He can't come in! He can't come in!

369
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:50,893
嘿 出什么事了? 前一分钟 你被赶出去了
Hey, what happened out there? One minute, you're banished,

370
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:52,183
下一分钟 你说大家都会死
the next you're telling everyone they're gonna die.

371
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:53,393
总结得好
That's the sum of it.

372
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:56,243
- 那我们是要走 还是干嘛?  - 没到时候
- So are we getting out of here or what?  - Not yet.

373
00:26:58,313 --> 00:26:59,513
我必须把这还了
I have to return this.

374
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,123
来接孩子?
Going to pick up the kids?

375
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:15,953
你说什么?
Excuse me?

376
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:18,603
干嘛不上车呢?
Why don't you get in the car?

377
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,253
Sayid 上车
Get in, Sayid.

378
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:28,663

除非你想我们一起去接孩子?

379
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:07,463
干嘛不坐?
Why don't you have a seat?

380
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:11,883
嘿 吃鸡蛋吗?
Hey, you want some eggs?

381
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,793
我能 呃...

383
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,323
呃 我们还有锅吗? 那锅在哪?
Uh, we still got that poacher? Where's the poacher?

384
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:23,053
你想要荷包蛋吗? 我做得挺好吃的
You want poached? Cause I could make you some good poached eggs.

385
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:25,143

No, thank you.

386
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:26,783
我做鸡蛋超好的
I make good eggs.

387
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:29,643
不来点吗?
No?

388
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:31,133
好吧
All right.

389
00:28:45,153 --> 00:28:45,943
我叫Martin Keamy
Martin Keamy.

390
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:50,313
Sayid Jarrah 你已经知道了
Sayid Jarrah, but you already know that.

391
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:52,073
噢 那个 我知道 是的
Uh, that, I do. Yeah.

392
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:54,513
好
Right.

393
00:28:59,273 --> 00:28:59,873
那么...
So...

394
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:01,863
Sayid啊...
Sayid...

395
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:03,893
你哥哥怎么样?
How's your brother doin'?

396
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:09,333
他的哥哥被打劫了
His brother got mugged

397
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:10,913
就在他自己的店门口
right out front of his own store.

398
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:12,303
这真是... 太惨了
It was just... terrible.

399
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:14,943
不过 这样一来 你知道
Well, but at least this way, you know,

400
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:17,823
你就可以 继续照顾他的家人了
you're still around to take care of his family.

401
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,343
你确实想要照顾他的家人 不是吗?
You do want to take care of his family, don't you?

402
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:25,403
承认了?
Yes?

403
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:31,213
你知道 我能看出来 你是一个很... 直爽的人 Sayid
You know, I can see that you're a very... direct guy, Sayid,

404
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:32,523
所以我也就直奔主题了
So I'm just gonna get to the point.

405
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:35,783
你的哥哥... 他向我借了些钱
Your brother... he borrowed some money from me,

406
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:36,863
就像其他人
and just like anybody,

407
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:38,903
就像那些借钱的 和还钱的人一样
who borrows money or has a loan to pay,

408
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:39,763
他欠了钱 就得还
he has to make payments.

409
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:42,463
我哥哥告诉我 他能还的 都已经还给你了
My brother told me he's paid you everything he owes,

410
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:44,993
但是你还不知足
but that you still want more.

411
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:48,553
Sayid 他骗了你 你哥哥确实欠我的
Sayid, that's a lie. You brother does owe me,

412
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:51,603
而且必须得有人 来还那些钱
and somebody is gonna pay me that money.

413
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:53,803
是你让我哥哥住院的吗?
Did you put my brother in the hospital?

414
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:57,963
噢 你认为是我干的?
Oh, you think it was me?

415
00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:01,643
不是我
I didn't do that.

416
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:05,993
你知道 这是一个危险的世界 Sayid
You know, it's a dangerous world, Sayid.

417
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:08,223
你对此一清二楚 因为你来自伊拉克
and you know that because you're from Iraq.

418
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:13,103
你永远也不知道 有人要偷袭...
You never know when somebody's just gonna sneak up...

419
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:14,133
啊!
Uhh!

420
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,513
噢!
Uhh!

421
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:20,573
喔 喔 喔 喔 喔
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

422
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:23,883
Sayid啊...
Sayid...

423
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:27,303
- 好 别紧张  - 闭嘴
- Okay, just relax now.  - Shut up.

424
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:31,053
好 好的
