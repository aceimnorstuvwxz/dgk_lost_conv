1
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:11,371
该死!
Son of a bitch!

2
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,341
Jin 快 醒醒 伙计
Jin. Come on. Wake up, buddy.

3
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,241
醒醒
Wake up.

4
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:29,331
Sawyer啊
Sawyer.

5
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:32,441
我睡了多久?
How long have I been out?

6
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:33,991
一会儿
A while.

7
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:36,061
我想你应该歇够了
Figured you could use the rest.

8
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:38,811
Claire和Locke... 他们呢?
Claire and Locke... where are they?

9
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:40,971
不知道 他们之前说会在日出前回来
I don't know. They said they'd be back by sunup.

10
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:43,971
- 在他们回来之前 我们得赶紧离开 - 冷静点 喔 喔
- We have to get out of here before they come back. - Easy. Whoa, whoa.

11
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,761
我投靠Locke了
I'm with Locke.

12
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,601
那不是Locke
That is not Locke.

13
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:51,731
嗯 我知道
Yeah, I know.

14
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:55,611
无论他是谁 他说他能把我们带出这该死的小岛
Whoever he is, he says he can get us off this damn island.

15
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,591
我不能走
I can't leave.

16
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,711
Sun还不知在岛上哪个角落呢
Sun could be here somewhere.

17
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:02,331
好吧
Fine.

18
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,061
我答应你 如果她在岛上 我们绝不离她而去
If she's here, you got my word. We ain't leaving without her.

19
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:08,821
什么声音?
What's that?

20
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:10,651
他们回来了
They're back.

21
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:42,021
嗨

29
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,401
嗯
Mmm.

30
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:14,391
宝贝 你和我不分伯仲
You weren't too shabby yourself, darlin'.

31
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:14,841
嗯
Mmm.

32
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:17,751
宝贝?
Baby?

33
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:18,751
嗯?
Yeah?

34
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:20,911
9点的时候 你不是要和那个人碰头吗?
Aren't you supposed to meet that guy at 9:00?

35
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:22,081
嗯 然后呢?
Yeah. So?

36
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:24,701
现在是8点...
It's 8...

37
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,111
42分
42.

38
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,111
该死!
Damn it!

39
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,341
我本来不想让你看见的
You weren't exactly supposed to see that.

40
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,001
Jimmy 你拿这么多钱要干什么?
Jimmy, what are you doing with all that money?

41
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,731
这次会面 有可能做成一笔交易
This meeting is a potential investment.

42
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:50,901
我们约定五五分账
We're going 50/50.

43
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,191
那家伙想先看到钱
The guy wants to see the money upfront.

44
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:56,751
别担心 不会太久的 我马上回来
Don't worry. It won't take long. I'll be right back.

45
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,671
然后我们就去兜风... 喔
Me and you'll go for round... Whoa.

46
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:00,881
离箱子远点
Step away from the case.

47
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:04,141
别乱来 宝贝
Take it easy, honey.

48
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,701
帅哥 有件事我得告诉你
Here's the thing, dimples.

49
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,451
我知道骗子的花样 我前夫就是骗子
I can spot a con man. I'm married to one.

50
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,631
所以我知道你们那些伎俩
So I know all about the pigeon drop.

51
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:13,881
哦 你刚说啥? 那箱子是偶然打开的?
Oh, what? That case just accidentally flew open?

52
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,851
你以为我笨得像头猪?
How stupid do you think I am?

53
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:19,321
事实上 你真是头蠢猪
Pretty damn stupid, actually.

54
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:21,941
什么?
Excuse me?

55
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:23,941
我的确在演戏 女人
This is a setup, lady.

56
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,081
屋外停着辆面包车
There's a van sittin' right outside.

57
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,111
这房子装了窃听器 已经被警察包围了
The room is bugged. The place is surrounded by cops.

58
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:30,661
所以现在 你把枪放下
So now you wanna put that gun down,

59
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,131
然后我们把事情理理清
and we'll work something out.

60
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,631
他们的目标不是你 他们要捉的是你丈夫
They don't care about you. They want your husband.

61
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,211
这箱子里有个追踪器 你所要做的
There's a tracer in the case. All you had to do

62
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,741
就是把你丈夫的藏身之处说出来
was take it back to wherever your hubby's hiding out.

63
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:42,791
你以为我真的会相信
You really except me to believe

64
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,341
你是警方派来的?
that you're working with the police?

65
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,751
如果这地方被包围了
If this place is surrounded,

66
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,841
为什么没一个人进来救你?
how come no one came to save you?

67
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,021
我不需要救援
I don't need saving,

68
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,481
因为你会听话
'cause you're gonna do the right thing

69
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:55,921
乖乖把枪放下 但如果你不放
and put that gun down. But if you don't,

70
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,891
那么 我也有办法
well, then all I gotta do is say the magic work,

71
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,321
让那扇门为我打开
and that door busts open.

72
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,321
你真是个蹩脚的骗子
You're a lousy con man.

73
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,501
Lafleur啊
Lafleur.

74
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:08,351
"La"什么?
"La" what?

75
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:09,901
警察! 把枪放下!
Police! Drop the gun!

76
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,911
- 手背过来 - 我们进来得早了点儿吧?
- Behind your back. - Cuttin' it a little close, huh?

77
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:18,241
实在没办法啊
Only way to cut it.

78
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,831
把你的衣服穿起来 Jim
Put your damn clothes on, Jim.

79
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:24,371
没问题 好搭档
You got it, partner.

80
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,701
- 你是警察? - 惊讶吧
- You're a cop? - Surprise.

81
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,801
走吧 快走
Let's go. Move.

82
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:41,801

迷失 第6季第8集

83
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,870
你就住在这里?
Is this where you lived?

84
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:22,690
嗯
Yeah.

85
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,540
那是什么?
What is that?

86
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,530
它是我的一切
It's all I had.

87
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,360
嗯 各位 听我说!
All right, everybody, listen up!

88
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,770
过来 围成圈
Come on in. Gather 'round.

89
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,920
我知道你们都累极了
I know that everyone is tired.

90
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,640
我们度过了...
It was a...

91
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,700
一个漫长而悲惨的夜晚
a long and traumatic night for all of us.

92
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,210
我知道 你们肯定满腹疑问
And you all have got a lot of questions, I know,

93
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,540
我会尽力作答
And I will make myself available to answer them.

94
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,900
但现在 我们得继续出发
But right now we need to keep moving.

95
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,490
- 要抓住白天的优势 - 我们想知道
- We have to take advantage of the daylight. - We wanna know

96
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,780
留在寺庙的人都怎样了
what happened to the people who stayed behind at the temple.

97
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,810
黑烟杀了他们
The black smoke killed them.

98
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,780
嘿
Hey.

99
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,540
我知道那里发生的一切 可怕至极
I know that what happened back there was really scary.

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,640
但一切都结束了
But it's over.

101
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,730
你们和我在一起
You're with me now,

102
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,580
我承诺 会让大家相安无事的
and I promise that I'm gonna take care of you.

103
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,040
好了
Okay.

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,160
我们出发吧
Alright, let's move out.

105
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,140

Sounds like you had a hell of a night.

106
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,410

- What about Miles? - I don't know what happened to him.

111
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,230
那你现在和Locke是一边的了?
So you're with Locke now?

112
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,030
我保持中立 Kate

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,700
我不知道我能不能再弄到一张票
I don't know if I can get another seat.

143
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,680
你可以把实话告诉我的...
You know you can tell me the truth...

144
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,390
什么也别隐瞒
About anything.

145
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,240
伙计 你在对我撒谎吗?
Are you lying to me, man?

146
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,400
我干嘛要撒谎?
Why the hell would I lie?

147
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,620
再走一里地 就空旷了
About a quarter mile ahead, there's a clearing.

148
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,940
我们会在那儿扎营 大家记得补充水源
We'll make camp there. Everybody fill up on water.

149
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,370
大概还有两三天的路程
We might be there a couple of days.

150
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,490
两三天?
A couple of days?

151
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,930
我以为你说我们翻过这座山就好
I thought you said we were gettin' off this rock.

152
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,470
的确是
We are.

153
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,440
什么时候?
When?

154
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,500
要不要换个地方 私下谈谈?
Maybe we should talk about this in private?

155
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,940
好啊 走吧
Great. Let's go.

156
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,870
我希望你不要打断我的话
I wish you hadn't interrupted me.

157
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,440
抱歉 我是个粗人
I'm sorry. I forgot my manners.

158
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,620
没事
I forgive ya.

159
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,660
寺庙那儿发生什么事了?
What happened back at the temple?

160
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,520
你怎么知道 要去把大家从黑烟手中救出来?
How'd you know to rescue everybody from that smoke thing?

161
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,010
我没有救他们
I didn't rescue them.

162
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,000
我就是那黑烟
I'm the smoke thing.

163
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,780
你是说 是你把那些人都杀掉的?
You telling me you killed all those people?

164
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,650
我给了他们安然逃离的机会
I gave them the opportunity to leave peacefully,

165
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,340
- 可他们视如敝屐 - 为什么?
- and they didn't take it. - Why not?

166
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,380
因为他们坚信
Because they're convinced

167
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,600
他们能把岛守得固若金汤 让我无处下手
that they're protecting the island from me,

168
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,980
事实上 我只想离开这里
when, in fact, all I wanna do is leave.

169
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,940
所以我不杀掉他们 就会被他们杀掉
So it's either kill or be killed.

170
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,720
我可不想死
And I don't want to be killed.

171
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,770
我们要坐船?
We goin' on a boat ride?

172
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,010
是你要坐船
You are.

173
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,970
去哪里?
Where?

174
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,260
九头蛇岛
Hydra Island.

175
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,950
九头蛇岛上有什么?
What's on Hydra Island?

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,830
飞机 Ajira航空的那架航班
The plane. The Ajira flight.

177
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,890
把你朋友带回来的那架飞机
The same plane that brought your friends back.

178
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,210
不幸地是 他们身边还有其他人
Unfortunately, they didn't come alone.

179
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,290
我有理由相信
And I have reason to believe that

180
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,310
个别乘客想对我们不利
some of the other passengers mean to do us all harm.

181
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,930
所以我想让你去那边 探探虚实
So I want you to go over there and do some recon.

182
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,860
听上去真安全哦
Well, that sounds safe.

183
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,060
- 你不会有事的 - 是吗? 那如果我
- You'll be fine. - Yeah? Well, what am I supposed to do

184
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,130
碰上了一个想加害我的人 可怎么办啊?
if I run into somebody who wants to do me harm?

185
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,900
- 我不担心这个 - 哦 你不担心 是吧?
- I'm not worried about that. - Oh, you're not, huh?

186
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,750
没错 因为你是我所遇到的 最会说谎的人了
No, because you are the best liar I ever met.

187
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,200
把该说的话都说给他们听
You tell 'em whatever you need to tell 'em

188
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,520
取得他们的信任 探明他们的一切
to gain their trust, find out everything you can about them,

189
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,650
然后回到这儿
and then get back here.

190
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,200
我再做一遍有什么意义啊?
Why exactly am I doing this again?

191
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,780
还有什么好想的呢 James?
Why do you think, James?

192
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,190
我们登上飞机 离开这个岛
We get on the plane, we fly off this island,

193
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,950
就永远不会再回来了
and we never look back.

194
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,670
来吧
Come on.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,450
喂?
Yeah?

196
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,740
Miles 这个姑娘长什么样来着?
Miles, what's this girl look like again?

197
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,790
红发 你看到几... 几个红头发的啊?
She's a redhead. How many... how many redheads do you see?

198
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,270
- 知道了 - 对她温柔点...
- Roger that. - Be nice to her...

199
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,050
好了 知道了
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,950
打扰一下
Excuse me.

201
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,460
你是Charlotte吧?
Would you be Charlotte?

202
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,240
没错
I most certainly am.

203
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,360
很高兴见到你 女士
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

204
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,100
谢谢
Thank you.

205
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,350
考古学 对吧?
Archaeology, huh?

206
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,720
有什么问题吗?
What's wrong with archaeology?

207
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,660
没什么
Nothin'.

208
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,730
我只是在想象你待在房间里
I just figured you'd be stuck in a room somewhere

209
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,370
给古董除灰的样子
dusting off antiques.

210
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,030
没有啦 其实我更多是在野外工作
No, I actually get to travel quite a bit,

211
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,280
去一些遥远又浪漫的地方
to far off and romantic places.

212
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,860
真的吗?
Really?

213
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,260
你喜欢像"夺宝奇兵"里演的那样吗?
What, you like an Indiana Jones or something?

214
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,330
是的 我就喜欢那种感觉
Yes. I'm exactly like Indiana Jones.

215
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,120
你也有根鞭子?
You got a whip?

216
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,580
或许吧
Maybe.

217
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,010
呃 说说你吧?
So, um, what about you?

218
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,620
- 说什么呢? - 你怎么会当上警察的?
- What about me? - Why did you become a cop?

219
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,420
你看过Steve Mcqueen演的"浑身是胆"吗?
You ever seen "Bullitt" Steve Mcqueen flick?

220
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,670
没有
No.

221
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,020
那我也就无从谈起了
Well, then I won't even bore you with an explanation.

222
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,460
拜托啦 James 别拿你应付其他发问的女孩那套
Okay, do me a favor, James, and don't treat me like

223
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,900
来搪塞我
all the other girls who ask you.

224
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,190
告诉我实话吧
Tell me the truth.

225
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,760
好吧...
Well...

226
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,000
我想我... 是到了人生的一个分水岭
I guess I... got to a point in my life

227
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,650
要么去做坏蛋 要么就去做警察
where I was either gonna come a criminal or a cop.

228
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,760
所以我选择了当警察
So I chose cop.

229
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,670
怎么啦?
What?

230
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,510
你懂的
You know what.

231
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,830
在没有那根鞭子的情况下 这过程真还不赖啊
Well, not bad, considering we didn't have that whip.

232
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,950
下次带过来
Bring it next time.

233
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,130
想喝水吗?
You want some water?

234
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,390
嗯 拿点过来吧
Mm-hmm. Yes, please.

235
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,830
介意我借一件T恤吗?
You mind if I borrow a T-shirt?

236
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,460
自己去拿吧 右边上面的抽屉里
Help yourself. Top drawer on the right.

237
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,570
谢谢
Thanks.

238
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,510
你他妈的在干嘛?
What the hell are you doing?

239
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,750
呃 我在找T恤啊
Um, I was just looking for T-shirt.

240
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,020
- 你看到什么了? - 没什么 就是...有张照片掉出来了
- What did you see? - Nothing, just that you had... that picture fell out,

241
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,790
- 我正准备放回去 - 你看到什么了?!
- and I was just trying to put it back. - What did you see?!

242
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,930
- 没什么! 我什么也没看到 - 滚出去
- Nothing! I didn't see anything. - Get the hell out.

243
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,670
- James 听我解释 - 出去!
- James, just let me explain. - Get out!

244
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:05,910

你相信Locke吗?
Do you believe Locke?

247
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,580
你指哪方面?
What do you mean?

248
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,490
他说他可以带我们离岛
That he can get us off the island.

249
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,970
没错 我相信他
Yes, I believe him.

250
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,100

Sayid, are you all right?

251
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,780

254
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,090
你在干什么啊?!
What are you doing?!

255
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,980
- 她把他带走了! 她把Aaron带走了! - Claire 你那会儿失踪了 Kate找不到你
- She took him! She took Aaron! - Claire, you had disappeared. Kate couldn't find you.

256
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,830
- 她做了她能做的一切 - 她带走了Aaron! 她凭什么那么做啊！
- She did what she had to do. - She took Aaron! She can't just do that!

257
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,760
你这么做是不对的
This is completely inappropriate.

258
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,310
懂吗?
All right?

259
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,310

265
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,420
请别伤害我!
Please don't hurt me!

266
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,580
你究竟是谁?
Who the hell are you?

267
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,630
我是唯一的幸存者
I'm the only one left.

268
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,130
打扰一下 先生?
Excuse me, sir?

Uh, he was arrested at the airport on a drug charge.

273
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,160
对不起 这不在我的职责范围内
Sorry. Not my department.

274
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,280
早上好啊 阳光男孩
Mornin', sunshine.

275
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,370

Come with me.

- Is there something you wanna tell me? - What?!

278
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,460
你不想说些什么吗?
Is there something you wanna tell me?

279
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,240
听着 她不该打开那个抽屉的
Look, she opened the wrong drawer.

280
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,350
你在说什么啊?
What the hell are you talking about?

281
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,980
我想知道 你在澳大利亚到底干了些什么
I wanna know what you were doing in Australia

282
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,000
就是你对我说你在棕榈泉的时候
when you told me you were in Palm Springs.

283
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,160
我查了你的信用卡记录 我知道你去了悉尼
I ran your credit card. I know you went to Sydney.

284
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,460
大洋航空公司 往返票
Oceanic. Round trip.

285
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,240
两天前 你搭乘815航班回来的
You took flight 815 back 2 days ago.

286
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,080
你查我的信用卡记录干什么啊?
What the hell are you doin' running my credit card?

287
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,400
你对我撒谎了!
You lied to me!

288
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,960
我们应该相互信任的
We're supposed to trust each other.

289
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,900
所以 Jim...
So, Jim...

290
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,920
你在澳大利亚做了些什么啊?
What were you doing in Australia?

291
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,800
与你无关
That's none of your damn business.

292
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,760
你知道吗?
You know what?

293
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,850
你说对了
You're right,

294
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,830
因为我不再是你的拍档了
because I'm not your partner anymore.

295
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,600
口渴吗?
You thirsty?

296
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,840
渴得很
Very.

297
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,310
我叫Sawyer
I'm Sawyer.

298
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,650
啊
Ahh.

299
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,110
我叫Zoe 简直无法相信还有人活着
I'm Zoe. I can't believe there's anybody left alive.

300
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,810
我还以为我认识飞机上的每一个人
I thought I knew everybody on the plane.

301
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,060
我不是这架飞机上的
I didn't come on this plane.

302
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,310
- 那你是乘哪架飞机来的啊? - 说来话长
- What plane did you come on? - Long story.

303
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,570
这儿发生什么事了? 怎么死了这么多人?
What the hell happened here? What killed all those people?

304
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,470
我...
I...

305
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,500
我们... 我们的飞机失事了
We... We crashed here,

306
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,120
大家还等着有人来...
and we were all just waiting for...

307
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,270
有人来救我们
someone to rescue us.

308
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,770
我正出去捡柴禾的时候
I was out collecting wood

309
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,480
突然听到...
when I heard...

310
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,860
尖叫声
screaming.

311
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,750
尖叫声?
Screaming?

312
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,280
当...
When...

313
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,770
当我回来的时候...
When I came back...

314
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,300
他们... 他们都已经死了
they were... they were all dead.

315
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,810
我花了两天时间 把这些尸体拖到一起
I spent the last two days dragging their bodies up here.

316
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,910
我不想让他们就这么曝晒在太阳底下
I didn't feel it was right to leave them out there in the sun.

317
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,020
你一个人吗?
Are you alone?

318
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,160
不是 我和一群人要回主岛
No. I'm with a group of people back on the main island.

319
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,510
- 我可以带你过去 - 哦 感谢上帝
- I can take you back there. - Oh, thank God.

320
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,860
信我一句吧
Trust me,

321
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,800
上帝才不管这事呢
God's got nothing to do with it.

322
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,570
对不起 Kate
I'm sorry, Kate.

323
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,180
什么?
Excuse me?

324
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,930
我得为Claire的行为向你道歉
I have to take responsibility for Claire's behavior.

325
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,140
我告诉她 是The Others带走了她的孩子
I was the one who told her that The Others had her baby.

326
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,950
你为什么要这么跟她说?
Why would you tell her that?

327
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,340
你有仇人吗?
Have you ever had an enemy?

328
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,900
让你憎恨万分的仇人?
Someone that you needed to hate?

329
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,380
突然感到有力量了 是吧?
Very powerful, isn't it?

330
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,880
失去Aaron以后 Claire几近崩溃了
Claire was devastated without Aaron.

331
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,190
她需要一些...
She needed something to...

332
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,170
一些让她活下去的动力 所以...
something to keep her going, so...

333
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,960
我给她制造了假想敌
I gave her something to hate.

334
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,220
当你告诉她真相的时候
And then when you told her the truth,

335
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,340
所有那些感觉 所有... 所有那些愤怒
all those feelings, all... all that anger

336
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,980
那些支撑她这么久的动力...
that she'd been holding on to for so long...

337
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,110
全都消失了
It had to go somewhere.

338
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,660
真有远见...
Very insightful...

339
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,360
出自一个死人之口
Coming from a dead man.

340
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,320
嗯
Mm.

341
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,900
人无完人
Well, nobody's perfect.

342
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,210
很抱歉发生了这样的事
I'm sorry that this happened.

343
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,200
我保证只要你给她些时间
And I'm sure if you give her time,

344
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,390
一切都会好起来的
everything will be all right.

345
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,460
之前我答应过 我会确保大家的安全
I promised before that I would keep everyone safe,

346
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,110
这话对你也同样适用 Kate
and that means you, too, Kate.

347
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,790
Sawyer去哪儿了?
Where did Sawyer go?

348
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,130
我会告诉你的
I'll show you.

349
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,120
觉得它还能飞吗?
Think that thing'll still fly?

350
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,940
我不知道 估计得费点儿工夫
I don't know. It'll take a bit of work

351
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,200
还得找个知道如何... 如何来操作的人才行
and someone who knows how to... how to do it.

352
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,170
我... 我猜你没有遇到过飞行员吧?
I... I take it you haven't come across the pilot?

353
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,070
是的 夫人
No, ma'am.

354
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,210
你刚刚说 有多少人和你在一块儿的?
How many people did you say were with you?

355
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,370
二十来个吧
Couple dozen.

356
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,270
他们都是和你乘同一架飞机来的?
Did they all come on the same plane with you?

357
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,300
有些是 但不全是
Some, not all.

358
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,700
你们的飞机是什么时候失事的?
When did you crash?

359
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,500
很久以前
Long time ago.

360
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,830
你们都有枪吗?
Do you all have guns?

361
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,080
我是说 不管是谁杀了这些人
I mean, whoever killed those people back there,

362
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,610
他们... 他们可能会再回来
they... they might come back.

363
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,840
哦 我们有很多枪
Yeah, we got plenty of guns.

364
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,480
你抓住那头好吗?
You wanna grab that end?

365
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,080
你说你要去哪?
Where'd you say you were headed?

366
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,360
什么?
What's that?

367
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,210
你的航班 目的地是哪儿?
Your flight. Where were you going?

368
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,820
哦 呃...
Oh. Uh...

369
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,760
关岛
Guam.

370
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,080
谁在关岛么?
What's in Guam?

371
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,380
我男朋友
My boyfriend.

372
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,460
你戏演得真好 宝贝 但是还没好到滴水不漏
You're good, sweetheart, but you ain't that good.

373
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,800
- 你在说什么? - 你是谁?
- What are you talking about? - Who are you?

374
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,620
放下你的武器! 马上放下!
Drop your weapon down! Drop it now!

375
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,040
你的名字Zoe 是真的吗?
Your name even Zoe?

376
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,990
你是叫Sawyer吗?
Is yours Sawyer?

377
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,430
跪下!
Down on your knees!

378
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,300
好的 好的 我很听话的
All right, all right. You got me.

379
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,230
带我去见你们的头儿
Take me to your leader.

380
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,120
小岛在那边... 我派Sawyer去那了
That island over there... that's where I sent Sawyer.

381
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,070
你只需要告诉我
You could've just told me

382
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,330
你派他去的是 那个我们曾被困在牢笼里的小岛
that you sent him to the island where we were locked in cages.

383
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,010
你没必要带我来这里
You didn't have to bring me down here.

384
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,140
是的 但是那时候我没机会对你说
Sure, but then I wouldn't have gotten to talk to you.

385
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,650
你把我当死人
You referred to me as a dead man.

386
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,020
我不是死人
I am not a dead man.

387
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,810
我知道你的感受 Kate
I know what you're feeling, Kate.

388
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,250
我知道你的经历
I know what you're going through.

389
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,750
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

390
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,170
因为...
Because...

391
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,040
我妈妈疯了
my mother was crazy.

392
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,150
很久很久以前 在我...
A long time ago, before I...

393
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,870
就像... 这么大的时候
looked... like this,

394
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,540
像所有人一样 我有一个妈妈
I had a mother, just like everyone.

395
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,470
她是个精神错乱的女人
She was a very disturbed woman.

396
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,360
正因为如此...
And as a result of that...

397
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,190
我的成长之路异常艰辛...
I had some growing pains...

398
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,030
问题是 我还得努力杀出一条血路
problems that I'm still trying to work my way through.

399
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,270
如果能...
Problems that...

400
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,690
避免... 这些问题
could h... have been avoided,

401
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,430
如今会大不相同
had things been different.

402
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,130
为什么要跟我说这些?
Why are you telling me this?

403
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,770
因为现在... Aaron...
Because now... Aaron...

404
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,140
也有一个疯妈妈
has a crazy mother, too.

405
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,800
下去 他在等你
Get in. He's waiting for you.

406
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,150
我不是担心我自己
It's not me I'm worried about.

407
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,540
我只是不知道 如果你和妈妈
I just don't know what I'd do

408
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,520
发生什么事 我应该做什么
if anything ever happened to you and ma.

409
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,460
不管怎样 我们不会有事的
Anyway, nothing's gonna happen to us.

410
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,610
至少今天不会
Not today, anyway.

411
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,510
这就是你生活的方式
It's the way you live this life,

412
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,810
每天一次
Each day one at a time.

413
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,150
如果你一辈子都在
Now if you spend your whole life

414
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,910
杞人忧天
worrying about something that's gonna happen,

415
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,040
在你意识到之前 你的生活已经结束了
before you know it, your life's over

416
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,410
你一辈子都只是在痛苦地担心
and you spent an awful lot of it just worrying.

417
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,730
嘿 你听见没?
Hey, you hear that?

418
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,800
这才是生活的全部...
That's what life's all about...

419
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,320
笑对生活 彼此相爱
laughing and loving each other,

420
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,390
知道当人们死的时候 他们并没有消失
and knowing that people aren't really gone when they die.

421
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,580
美好的回忆支撑着我们
We have all the good memories to sustain us

422
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,240
直到再次相见
until we see 'em again.

423
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,150
想要不害怕 很难 爸爸
It's hard not being afraid, pa.

424
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,490
我知道 宝贝儿
I know, sweetheart

425
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,380
我知道
I know.

426
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,390
你真会开玩笑
You've got to be joking.

427
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,130
我能进去吗?
May I come in?

428
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,080
- 当然不能 - 为什么?
- Absolutely not. - Why not?

429
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,340
你不是吧 凌晨3点把我踢出来
You don't get to kick me out at 3:00 in the morning

430
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,810
然后第二天过来
and then come 'round the next day

431
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,350
带着一副小狗似的可怜眼神 和一朵忧郁的向日葵
with puppy dog eyes and a sad sunflower.

432
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,040
听着 我不知道
Look, I don't know

433
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,510
你是因为孤寂 或内疚 还是完全疯了
if you're just lonely or guilty or completely mad.

434
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:01,910
但是你知道吗? 我不在乎 是你搞砸的一切
But you know what? I don't care. You blew it.

435
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,890
- 你把什么锁在这里? - 不关你事 快走
- What you got in here? - None of your business. Keep moving.

436
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,870
进来
Come.

437
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,520
他来了 老大
He's here, sir.

438
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,820
谢谢 Zoe
Thanks, Zoe.

439
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,000
能让我们单独待会儿吗?
Would you leave us, please?

440
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,830
没问题
Of course.

441
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,510
你好啊 Ford先生
Hello, Mr. Ford.

442
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,210
我叫Charles Widmore
My name is Charles Widmore.

443
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,000
- 你知道我是谁吗? - 我当然知道
- Do you know who I am? - Of course I do.

444
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,430
你派了艘船到岛上 还下令手下杀光我们
You're the fella sent a freighter to the island, and order the guys to kill us all.

445
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,960
真可怜...
It's sad, really...

446
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,900
你知道的太少了
How little you actually know.

447
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,370
哦 我知道是你们杀了所有人
Well, I know you murdered all them people out there

448
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,280
- 然后把他们扔到沟里 - 我们没杀那些人
- and dropped 'em in the ditch. - We didn't murder those people.

449
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,180
但是我也不指望你能相信
But I don't expect you to believe that.

450
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,310
很好 因为我根本就不信
Good, 'cause I don't.

451
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,520
那你跟我说说 谁派你来这个岛上的?
So why don't you tell me what brought you over to this island?

452
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,780
John Locke派我来的
John Locke sent me.

453
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,430
John Locke已经死了
John Locke's dead.

454
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,510
我想我俩都知道 我所说这个人
I think we both know the guy I'm talking about

455
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,360
不是真的Locke
is not really Locke.

456
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,360
我们做个交易吧 老大
So here's the deal, chief.

457
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,270
我回去告诉他 海岸上什么都没有
I'll go back over there and tell him the coast is clear,

458
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,660
我连人影都没发现
that I didn't find anybody.

459
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,400
然后我把那个老头带到你门口
Then I'll bring the old man right to your doorstep.

460
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,980
接着你就可以杀了他
Then you can kill him.

461
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,060
交换条件是什么 James?
And what do you want in exchange, James?

462
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,610
第一... 我带回来的人...
One... the people I come back with...

463
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,550
我船上的人...
the people on my boat...

464
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,840
别动他们 一根毫毛都不能碰
don't get touched, not even a hair on their head.

465
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,030
第二...
And two...

466
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,200
你让我们安全地离开小岛
you give us safe passage off the island.

467
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,830
我凭什么信任你?
How do I know I can trust you?

468
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,370
因为我信任你
Same way I know I can trust you.

469
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,080
那么...
So...

470
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,520
我们达成协议了吗?
do we have an agreement?

471
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,150
我想是的
I suppose we do.

472
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,790
Kate啊
Kate.

473
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,480
我...
I...

474
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,760
我只是...
I just, um...

475
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,360
我只想说 对不起
I... I just wanna say I'm sorry.

476
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,180
我不知道我为什么那么做
I don't know why I did that.

477
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,050
我知道你做的一切 都是因为你关心我
I know everything you did was just 'cause you care about me

478
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,360
和Aaron
and about Aaron.

479
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,590
谢谢你
Thank you.

480
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,090
谢谢你照顾他
Thank you for taking care of him.

481
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,500
对不起
I'm sorry.

482
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,540
非常非常地 对不起
I'm so, so sorry.

483
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,620
好了
It's okay.

484
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,010
没事
It's okay.

485
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,380
好了啊
It's okay.

486
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,800
怎么样?
How'd go?

487
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
你不是真的派我去那儿
You didn't really send me over there

488
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,620
找飞机上的乘客吧?
to find passengers from that plane, did you?

489
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,990
不是
No.

490
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,580
如果你感兴趣
Well, in case you're interested,

491
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,930
他们都死了
they're all dead.

492
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,490
哦 真惨啊
Well, that's terrible.

493
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,890
发生了什么?
What happened?

494
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,260
我不知道
I don't know.

495
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,910
James 你知道什么?
Well, what do you know, James?

496
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,920
我知道那个小岛有个人
I know there's a man over there on that island

497
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,710
如果不打一仗 他不会让我们登机的
that ain't gonna let us get on that plane without a fight.

498
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,050
他叫Widmore 驾着一艘潜艇来的
Came over on a sub. Name's Widmore.

499
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,900
Charles Widmore吗?
Charles Widmore?

500
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,590
哦 我想你们认识
Well, I guess y'all know each other.

501
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,560
他不是一个人
He ain't alone.

502
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,060
至少有6个全副武装的同伙
I counted at least six armed compadres with him,

503
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,550
还不算潜艇上的工作人员
not to mention whatever crew's on that sub.

504
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,180
那有个锁着的房间... 有东西藏在里面
There's a locked room on there... somethin' they're hiding.

505
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,840
他们还在架设电缆塔 就像在New Otherton的那些塔一样
And they're settin' up pylons, like the ones at New Otherton.

506
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,230
你知道的...
You know...

507
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,220
那些塔能抵御黑烟
the ones that keep out that smoke thing.

508
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,650
你跟他们怎么说我的?
And what did you tell them about me?

509
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,550
我告诉他们
I told them

510
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,080
我会告诉你那岸上没人 然后带你过去
I'd tell you the coast was clear and bring you back with me.

511
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,330
带你径直走进他们的陷阱
Walk you right into their trap.

512
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,500
那样 他们可以杀了你...
That way, they could kill you...

513
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,230
这意味着 当我们改变进攻计划的话
which means they'll be caught with their pants down

514
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,000
他们来不及反应 就会束手待毙
when we change our plan of attack.

515
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,610
James 我感谢你的忠心
I appreciate your loyalty, James.

516
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,090
你说过要送我离开这个岛
You said you were gonna get me off this island.

517
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,970
说话要算话
Deal's a deal.

518
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,620
- 你在这干嘛? - 上车
- What are you doing here? - Get in the car.

519
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,660
Sawyer是谁?
Who's Sawyer?

520
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,670
我9岁的时候
When I was 9 years old,

521
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,760
我爸杀了我妈 然后他自杀了
my father shot my mother, and then he killed himself.

522
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,370
Sawyer是罪魁祸首
Sawyer was the reason why.

523
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,870
他是个骗子
He was a grifter.

524
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:18,130
大骗子
Con man.

525
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,970
自从我大学毕业以后
I've been hunting him down

526
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,830
一直在追捕他
since the day I left the academy.

527
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,040
我在澳大利亚追查到一个线索
I chased down a lead in Australia,

528
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,030
是一个名字... Anthony Cooper
got a name... Anthony Cooper.

529
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,820
我搜索这个名字 得到一堆叫Anthony Cooper的人
I ran the name. I got a list of Anthony Coopers,

530
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,880
于是我挨个调查他们
and I've been calling them.

531
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,030
当我找到要找的那个...
And when I find the right one...

532
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,620
我会杀了他
I'm gonna kill him.

533
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,410
为什么以前 你一点都没跟我说过?
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

534
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,860
我知道你一直想劝我放弃
I knew you'd try and talk me out of it.

535
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,380
没错
Damn right.

536
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,780
好极了
Fair enough.

537
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,660
喔! 我的车!
Whoa! My car!

538
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,340
嘿!
Hey!

539
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,430
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

540
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,460
晚饭吃什么?
What's for dinner?

541
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,920
野兔
Rabbit.

542
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,880
应该没问题
I think.

543
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,840
很好 我正饿着
Good. I'm starving.

544
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,360
你在为Locke跑腿干什么?
What are you doing running errands for Locke?

545
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,860
我不给任何人跑腿
I ain't runnin' errands for nobody.

546
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,240
他说他派你去另一个岛
He said he sent you over to the other island.

547
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,980
你找到飞机了吗?
Did you find the plane?

548
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,980
嗯
Yeah.

549
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,190
然而并不是只有飞机
And that ain't the only thing over there.

550
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,670
一个叫Widmore的家伙在海滩上扎营
A guy named Widmore set up camp on the beach,

551
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,570
带了一队人...
got a whole team with him...

552
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,750
全副武装
guys with guns.

553
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,220
他们为Locke而来
They're here for Locke.

554
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,230
那你要做什么?
So what are you gonna do?

555
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,880
我要让他们打一仗
I'm gonna let them fight it out.

556
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,400
当他们全力交战 无暇他顾的时候...
And while they got their hands full with each other...

557
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,630
我们离开这个见鬼的小岛
you and me are gettin' the hell off this island.

558
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,450
即使我们能上得了飞机 谁会开呢?
Even if we could get on that plane, who's gonna fly it?

559
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,220
我们不坐飞机 雀斑女
We ain't taking the plane, Freckles.

560
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,650
我们坐潜艇走

We're taking the sub.
