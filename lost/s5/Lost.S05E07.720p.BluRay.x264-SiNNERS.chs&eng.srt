John  能拯救小岛的唯一方法
The only way to save the island,John,

3
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:07,042
就是让你们所有人都回岛上去
Is to get your people back here.

4
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:09,026
直升机要降落在船上  然后船...
The chopper was headed for the boat. The boat--

5
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:12,012
没事  他们都很好  John  他们已经到家了
No,they're fine,John, and they're already home.

6
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:13,061
所以你得去说服他们回来
So you have to convince them to come back.

7
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:15,007
怎么说  怎么把他们劝回来
How? How am I supposed to do that?

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,058
你得死掉  John
You're gonna have to die, John.

9
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:20,073
-你真要下去吗  -对
- You're going down there? - Uh-huh.

10
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:24,006
要不咱们应该怎么离开这个岛
What exactly are you hoping a way off the island?

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,072
等你把你那些朋友都找到
Once you get all of your friends together--

12
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:40,070
必须是每一个离岛的人  一个都不能少
and it must be all of them, everyone who left--

13
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:42,079
等你说服他们跟你走
once you've persuaded them to join you,

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:47,017
Eloise Hawking会具体告诉你怎么回岛
Eloise Hawking will tell you exactly how to come back.

15
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:49,050
Richard说我会死
Richard said I was going to die.

16
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:53,067
这就是所谓的牺牲
That's why they call it sacrifice.

没什么  没什么有价值的

30
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:28,053
那你刚才把什么装包里了

你想要就给你

Roxanne当时正在南边侦查

穿着西服

没人认识他吗
Nobody recognizes him?

38
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:59,021
没有  不管他是谁  他都不是我们的人
No. Whoever he is, he didn't come with us.

39
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,075
那我们怎么知道
Then how do we know he isn't one of

40
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:01,077
他是否属于失踪人员
The ones who disappeared?

41
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:03,097
-他不是  -你又怎么知道
- He's not. - And how do you know?

42
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:07,006
因为他没在飞机上
Because he wasn't on the plane.

43

这人有什么要说的吗
What did this man have to say?

44
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:11,038
你自己问
You can ask him yourself.

不是  它们本来就在那

原来是3艘

但是飞行员和几位女士划走了一艘

00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:54,052
直接在半夜划走的
Just ran off in the middle of the night.

对  就是他

你得跟Caesar要

谁也不记得你跟我们是同趟航班
Nobody remembers you being on the plane.

69
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:34,008
是吗  我自己也不记得
Well,I don't remember being on it either.

70
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:36,058
-那你记得什么  -那可多了

72
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:42,060
不记得  但是我可以猜

74
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:49,095
我觉得这身西服
I think this suit

75
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,057
是我入土的寿衣
Is what they were gonna bury me in.

认识你的时候  我才17岁

00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:04,024
告诉我  John

116
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:08,013
从我们第一次见面  你那边已经过了多久了
How long has it been for you since... we first met,

117
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,055
从你走进我们的营地
Since you walked into our camp

118
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:12,061
和Richard谈话开始
And you spoke to Richard?

119
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:15,003
四天
Four days.

120
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,064
这真难以想象
That’s incredible.

121
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,046
沙漠里的摄像机是你的吗
The camera in the desert, that was yours?

122
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,071
是的
Yeah.

123
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:22,076
你怎么知道我在那里
How did you know I'd be there?

124
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,026
因为那里是出口
Because that's the exit.

125
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,052
我恐怕
I was afraid

126
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,023
Benjamin会骗你离开那个岛
Benjamin might fool you into leaving the island

127
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:32,042
就像他对我所做的
Like he did with me.

128
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:34,019
我是他们的领导
I was their leader.

129
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:36,038
其他人吗？
The others?

130
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:39,013
他们对我来说不是"其他人"  我们是一样的
They’re not the "others" to me. they're my people.

131
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:41,016
我们平静地保卫着这个小岛
We protected the island peacefully

132
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,051
有三十多年了
For more than three decades.

133
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:46,064
但后来我被放逐了
But then I was exiled

134
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:49,019
被他...
By him...

135
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,085
就像你一样
Just as you were.

136
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,015
不  我离开的时候Ben不在那里
No. Ben wasn't even there when i left.

137
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:56,080
他已经走了  我不是被放逐的
He was already gone. I, I... I wasn't exiled.

138
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,026
我... 选择离开
I... chose to leave.

139
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,080
你为什么要那么做？
Why... would you do that, John?

140
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:10,038
你要把他们带回来
You’ve come to bring them back...

141
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,047
那些离开的人
The ones who left.

142
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,055
不  不
No. .

143
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:19,071
你说的不是实话  我确信
I understand you lying to me. I do.

144
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:21,079
但是你应该知道
But there's something you should know.

145
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:25,068
你那些离开小岛的朋友们
All your friends who left the island

146
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,091
他们已经回来三年了
They’ve been back three years.

147
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,044
三年？
Three years?

148
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,091
他们回归了正常的生活
And they've gone back to their normal lives.

149
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:34,080
但没有一个人对发生的事情说了实话
And none of them has spoken a word of truth

150
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:36,064
也没说他们当时在哪
About where they were.

151
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,099
我得把他们带回来
I have to bring them back.

152
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:49,012
我会尽我所能帮助你的
I'm gonna do everything in my power to help you do that.

153
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:51,083
为什么？
Why?

154
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:54,050
什么为什么？
"Why"?

155
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:57,099
你为什么要帮我？
Why would you help me?

156
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:02,047
因为有场战争要来了  John
Because there's a war coming, John.

157
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,089
如果它发生的时候你还没有回到小岛
And if you're not back on the island when that happens,

158
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:11,009
邪恶的一方会胜利
The wrong side is going to win.

159
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:23,084
Jeremy Bentham是谁？
"Jeremy Bentham"?

160
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:25,089
一个英国哲学家
He was a British philosopher.

161
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:28,099
你父母给你了个幽默的名字
Your parents had a sense of humor when they named you,

162
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:31,067
所以为什么我不能这么做
So why can't I?

163
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,055
这些钱够你用了
This should be money enough for now.

164
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:37,009
这电话可以全球通话
The phone's international.

165
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:39,074
如果你有任何需要联系我
If you need to reach me, for anything,

166
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:42,061
拨23
Just press 23.

167
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:45,082
档案里有你们人的行踪
The folder contains your people's whereabouts,

168
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:48,025
所有曾经在岛上又离开的人
Everyone that was on the island that left.

169
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,061
你一直监视着他们
You’ve been watching them?

170
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:57,026
我对那个岛的未来投资了很多  John
I'm deeply invested in the future of the island, John.

171
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,091
所以是的  我监视了他们
So, yes, I've been watching them.

172
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:04,066
我不会与这事扯上联系
I wouldn't mention I'm involved in this.

173
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:06,074
很难想象他们会怎么看我
I can't imagine what they think of me,

174
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:08,053
尤其是被Benjamin的谎言迷惑后
Having listened to Benjamin's lies.

175
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:10,055
我怎么知道你不是在撒谎
How do I know that you're not the one who's lying?

176
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,060
我没有想要杀你
I haven't tried to kill you.

177
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:15,022
你和他也说了同样的话吗
Would you say the same for him?

178
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:20,029
你还是不相信我
You still don't trust me.

179
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,034
你派了群杀手去那个岛上
You sent a team of killers

180
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:24,053
还有一船的炸药
And a boatload of c4 to the island.

181
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:27,077
那不叫信任
That... doesn't exactly scream "trust."

182
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,006
我需要Linus离开那里
I needed Linus removed...

183
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,098
所以你可以发挥了
So it could be your time.

184
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,086
没错
Right.

185
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,043
那个岛需要你  John
The island needs you, John.

186
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:40,056
很长一段时间来
It has for a long time.

187
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:43,017
是什么让你觉得我如此特殊？
What makes you think I'm so special?

188
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:48,042
因为你本来就特殊
Because you are.

189
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:59,002
你的战车来了
Ah. your chariot has arrived.

190
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,028
他说我要死了
He said I would die.

191
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:04,038
-能再说一遍吗  -Richard Alpert
- I beg your pardon? - Richard Alpert.

192
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,095
他说只有我死了他们才能回去
He said only way to get them to come back was if I died.

193
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:10,087
我不知道他为什么这么说
I don't know why he said that,

194
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,048
但我不会让那发生的
But I'm not gonna let that happen.

195
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,038
这是Matthew Abaddon
This is Matthew Abaddon.

196
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,088
他会带你去任何地方
He’ll take you anywhere you need to go,

197
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:24,081
保护你
Protect you from whomever intends to do you harm.

198
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:27,087
Locke先生
Mr. Locke.

199
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:42,041
祝你们好运John  还有要快
Good luck, John, and Godspeed.

200
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:06,084
Locke先生  有什么需要的尽管告诉我
Anything you need, Mr. Locke, you just let me know.

201
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:10,032
任何事情
Anything.

202
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,061
你需要我帮你找什么老朋友吗
Anybody from your past you want me to look up for you?

203
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:16,047
Locke先生  全世界都认为你死了
The whole world thinks you're dead, Mr. Locke.

204
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,060
会有一些人高兴见到你的
There must be somebody who'd be happy to see you.

205
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:22,049
-请别和我说话  -好吧
- Please don't talk to me.  - You got it.

206
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,029
但我们已经差不多到机场了
But we're almost at the airport,

207
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,001
所以你至少告诉我去哪里
So you at least have to tell me where we're going first.

208
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:37,072
圣多明各
Santo Domingo.

209
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:49,019
圣多明各  多米尼加共和国
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic

210
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:06,023
[西班牙语]

211
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,008
[西班牙语]

212
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:11,034
[西班牙语]

213
00:17:15,023 --> 00:17:17,008
Sayid
Hey, Sayid!

214
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:18,043
Mira
Mira!

215
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,093
[西班牙语]

216
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,023
我不相信
I don't believe this.

217
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,074
你真的想让我回去
You actually want me to go back?

218
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:33,087
我知道这很荒谬  但你要相信我
I know how it sounds, Sayid, but you have to trust me.

219
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:36,096
-这是救他们的唯一办法了  -我不会回去的
- This is the only way to save them. -I'm not going back.

220
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:41,023
两年来  我已经习惯去思考
For two years, I was manipulated into thinking

221
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:44,057
-我在保护岛上所有人  -谁在操纵你
- I was protecting everyone on the island. - Who was manipulating you?

222
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,062
Ben
Ben.

223
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,050
那么谁在操纵你  John
So who is manipulating you, John?

224
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:55,014
是我自己的决定  不关其他人的事
this is coming from me, nobody else.

225
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,001
我了解你  Sayid
I know you, Sayid.

226
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:58,044
而且你深知
And deep down in your heart,

227
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,050
我们根本就不该离开小岛
you know we never should've left the island.

228
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,035
就是因为我离开了小岛
It's only because I left the island

229
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:05,019
我才能最终娶到我心爱的女人
that I was finally able to marry the woman I loved.

230
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:11,062
我们共度了九个月
we spent nine months together--

231
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:15,017
一生中最美好的九个月  John
the best nine months of my life,John.

232
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,070
那才是我内心的想法
that's what i know in my heart.

233
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,001
那她现在在哪里
where is she now?

234
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:23,051
她被人杀害了
she was murdered.

235
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:31,089
我很难过
i'm sorry.

236
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:35,013
你为什么非要回去
why do you really need to go back?

237
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:40,006
仅因为你别无他处可去吗
Is it just because you have nowhere else to go?

238
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,012
如果你改了主意
If you change your mind,

239
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:48,020
我会在洛杉矶维斯特菲尔德酒店等你
i'll be staying under the name "Jeremy Bentham"

240
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:52,069
我登记的名字是Jeremy Bentham
in l.a. at the westerfield hotel.

241
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,098
如果你改主意
And if you change your mind,

242
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:59,021
我们欢迎你回到这里做正事
you're welcome to come back here and do some real good.

243
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:04,047
再见  John
Good-bye, John.

244
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,059
纽约
New York，NY

245
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:27,043
-你问过是否能为我找到某人  -是的
- You asked if there was someone you could look up for me. - Yes, I did.

246
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:31,029
我要找Helen  Helen Norwood
Her name is helen-- helen norwood--

247
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:33,093
住在洛杉矶

248
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:37,065
她是你的前女友吗

249
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:42,016
把我弄下车
Help me get out of the car.

250
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:48,022
那就是Michael Dawson的儿子吗
So that's michael dawson's son,huh?

251
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,074
就是
Yeah.

252
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:51,052
都长这么大了
Boy's gotten big.

253
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:08,024
-我去去就来  我走了  -好的
- um,i'm--i'm-a be right back. i'm-a go.  - all right.

254
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:10,029
-我待会就回来  -好的

258
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,070
你怎么了

259
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,044
我的腿受伤到
i hurt my leg.

260
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:28,053
似乎看到我  你并不惊讶呀
you don't seem surprised to see me.

261
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:30,086
我梦到过你
i've been having dreams about you.

262
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:34,033
你在岛上  穿了件西装
you were on the island, wearing a suit,

263
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:36,056
有好多人围着你
and there are people all around you.

264
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,099
他们想要伤害你  John
they wanted to hurt you, john.

265
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:42,026
幸好是个梦而已
good thing they're just dreams.

266
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,045
我爸爸...
is my dad...

267
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,053
他回到岛上了吗
is he back on the island?

268
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:48,059
我已经三年没见到他了
i haven't talked to him in three years.

269
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:51,027
我想他肯定回去了
i figured he must've gone back.

270
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:55,099
我最后听到关于他的消息是
um,last i heard,

271
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:58,056
他在岛附近的一艘货船上
your dad was on a freighter near the island.

272
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:03,070
那么你来找我干什么
so why'd you come to see me?

273
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,091
我只是想看看你是否过得好
i just wanted to make sure you were okay.

274
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:14,000
很好

275
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,040
我挺好的
i'm doing pretty good.

276
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:20,015
我得走了  很高兴见到你  John
well,i gotta go. it was good seeing you,john.

277
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:24,022
我也是  保重
yeah. take care.

278
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,029
我看你是不会邀他一起去了
I take it you didn't invite him along.

279
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,010
他已经经历了够多了
Boy's been through enough.

280
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:35,083
已经有两个人不干  Locke先生
That's 0-for-2, Mr. Locke.

281
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,057
或许是我理解错了
maybe i misunderstood,

282
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:39,084
但我想你得带回所有人
but i thought you had to bring everyone back.

283
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:41,092
我只要说服一个人
i only need to convince one.

284
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:45,026
只要我说服了他  那其他的人自然会跟来
and if i can do that, the rest will come.

285
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:47,051
或许是我搞错了
and maybe i was mistaken,

286
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,037
我以为你只是我的司机而已
but i thought you we my driver.

287
00:22:01,026 --> 00:22:04,080
圣罗莎  加利福尼亚

288
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,090
你好 Hugo
hello, hugo.

289
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:24,081
看来你没成功啊?
So you didn't make it,huh?

290
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,033
什么意思
pardon me?

291
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:28,062
你没成功
you didn't make it.

292
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:31,002
放心  没什么大不了
it's cool. no biggie.

293
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:34,012
你不是第一个来看我的人
you're not the first person to visit me,you know.

294
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:36,034
你怎么坐在轮椅上了
but what's up with the wheelchair?

295
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,074
我掉进洞里摔伤了腿
uh,i broke my leg falling down a hole.

296
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:42,046
你就是那么死的
oh. is that how you died?

297
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,051
Hugo  我没有死
hugo,i'm not dead.

298
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:49,083
你当然没有
sure you're not.

299
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:52,002
我发誓  我真的活着
no,i-i promise you, i'm very much alive.

300
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,090
Susie
hey,susie,

301
00:22:53,093 --> 00:22:57,027
-我在和一个坐在轮椅上的人聊天吗  -有啊
- Am i talking to a dude in a wheelchair right now? - Yep.

302
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:03,073
我的天  老兄  你来做什么
whoa, dude. what are you doing here?

303
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:06,010
我要你跟我回岛上去
i need you to come back to the island with me.

304
00:23:06,014 --> 00:23:07,050
等等  什么意思?
wait. what?

305
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,069
不止你一个人  所有离开的人都要回去
and not just you, but everybody who left.

306
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:12,064
-你是说Jack  Kate  -所有人
-you mean jack and kate... -everybody.

307
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:17,054
不好意思  老兄
i'm sorry,dude.

308
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:19,094
我想大家不会回去的
i don't think that's gonna happen.

309
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,016
Jack现在是个医生
jack's a doctor now,

310
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,056
Sun也生了孩子
and--and sun's,like, got her baby,

311
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,012
Kate和Aaron一起生活
and kate's got aaron.

312
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,069
老兄  冷静点
dude,be cool.

313
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,015
别看  我们被人盯上了
don't look, but we're being watched.

314
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,038
老兄
dude!

315
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,088
别担心  他和我一起的
oh,don't worry. he's with me.

316
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:40,049
-什么   -他开车送我来的  他没问题
- what?! - he's just driving me around. he's okay.

317
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,058
他才问题大了呢
that dude is far from okay.

318
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:44,062
当我第一次到这里时
when i first got locked up in here,

319
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:47,024
他就来找我  说他是大洋航空公司的
he showed up,claiming that he worked for oceanic air.

320
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:49,077
他是个魔鬼  你不该相信他的
he's evil! you should not be trusting that guy.

321
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,006
-听说我  -不不不  我不要听
please,just listen to me. no,no,no! i'm not listening to you!

322
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:54,057
-Hugo  求你了  听我说  -啦啦啦
- hugo,please,listen. - la,la,la,la,la

323
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:57,035
-我要进去了  我要进去  -Hugo
i wanna go back in. i wanna go back in. hugo--

324
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:58,093
我不会跟你去任何地方
no,i'm not going anywhere with you!

325
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,066
快走开  再见  
go away! bye!

326
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,098
快离开
get out of here!

327
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,048
这是第三个了
that's three visits now.

328
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:20,068
Locke先生  你得动作快些
you may wanna step up your game,Mr. Locke,

329
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:23,080
否则我们的麻烦就大了
or we're all in serious trouble.

330
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:28,081
你到底为Widmore Matthew先生做什么
What exactly is it that you do for Mr. Widmore,Matthew?

331
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:33,077
你现在准备谈这个了吗
You're ready to talk about it now,huh?

332
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:37,061
John
John...

333
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:40,019
你不是真的打算 装作你不记得
You're not really gonna pretend you don't remember that

334
00:24:40,027 --> 00:24:43,040
我是你出事故后待的那个医院的清洁工吧
I was an orderly in the hospital right after your accident?

335
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:46,060
正是我告诉你继续旅行
that I was the one who told you to go on your walkabout?

336
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:48,027
你搭的飞机在小岛上失事后
the same walkabout

337
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,074
你可以在岛上继续你的旅行
that put you on the plane that crashed on that island?

338
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:53,075
不
no.

339
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,039
我记得
I remember.

340
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:59,087
John  我帮人们去他们需要去的地方
I help people get to where they need to get to,John.

341
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,058
这就是我为Widmore先生干的活
that's what I do for Mr. Widmore.

342
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,019
洛杉矶  加利福尼亚

343
00:25:24,018 --> 00:25:26,074
答案是不
the answer is no.

344
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,080
Kate  我认为你不明白
Kate,i don't think you understand--

345
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,040
不  你已经说得很明白
No,you made yourself perfectly clear.

346
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:34,085
如果我不回去  岛上的人都得死
Everyone on the island is gonna die if I don't go back.

347
00:25:34,088 --> 00:25:36,053
答案是不
And the answer is no.

348
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:38,085
为什么  你不在乎他们吗
Why? Don't you care about them?

349
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:46,045
你有爱过别人吗  John
Have you ever been in love, John?

350
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,098
什么
What?

351
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:50,080
有时我会在想
I think about you sometimes.

352
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:56,064
你为什么这么希望待在那个岛上
I think about how desperate you were to stay on that island.

353
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,032
然后我就意识到
and then I realized...

354
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:06,090
这都是因为你不爱任何人
it was all because you didn't love anybody.

355
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,022
那不是真的
That's not true.

356
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:15,017
我曾经爱过
I loved someone...

357
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,091
某人
once.

358
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:23,006
她叫Helen
Her name was Helen.

359
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:27,056
怎么了
What happened?

360
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,098
只是  只是
it--it...

361
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:36,045
只是无果而终
it just didn't work out.

362
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,022
为什么无果  John
Why not,John?

363
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,080
我很生气
I was angry.

364
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:47,037
我被...
I was...

365
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,010
魔鬼附体了
ob-obsessed.

366
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:56,009
看看你走得多远
and look how far you've come.

367
00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:13,090
我来帮你  Locke先生
Let me help you, Mr. Locke.

368
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:15,091
你找到她了吗
Did you find her?

369
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:17,047
找到谁
Find who?

370
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,005
Helen Norwood  我向你打听的女人
Helen Norwood--the woman I asked you about.

371
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:21,013
没找到  对不起
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

372
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:23,022
三年的时间太长了
Three years is a long time.

373
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,083
很有可能她结婚了  改了名字
It's possible she got married, changed her name.

374
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:29,047
-也许她出国了  -你找到了其他人  所有人
- Maybe she moved out of state. - You found everyone else! all of them.

375
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:32,014
Sayid在一个不存在的地方  你都可以找到
Sayid was in the middle of nowhere,

376
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:34,054
而Helen只是搬家了  你就找不到
but you can't find Helen because she moved?

377
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:37,064
你的工作是带人们去他们要去的地方吗
Your job is to get people to where they need to get to?

378
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:40,042
那好  我要到她那里去
Well,I need to get to her.

379
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:45,039
圣莫尼卡  加利福尼亚

380
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,099
她出了什么事情
What happened to her?

381
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:05,087
她死于脑动脉瘤
She died of a brain aneurysm.

382
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:07,095
我很遗憾  Locke先生
I'm very sorry,Mr. Locke.

383
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,088
她爱我
She loved me.

384
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:22,013
如果我...
If I had just...

385
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:28,070
我们就可以在一起
we could've been together.

386
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,069
也许你可以
Maybe you could have.

387
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:33,030
任何事情都不会改变  她仍然会去世
That wouldn't change anything. she'd still be gone.

388
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,087
是吗
Would she?

389
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,065
Helen在她该去的地方
Helen is where she's supposed to be.

390
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:45,050
无论多么悲伤  她的路通向那里
as sad as it is, her path led here.

391
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:48,060
而你的路  无论你做过什么或要做什么
and you path,no matter what you did or what you do,

392
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:51,020
你的路通向小岛
your path leads back to the island.

393
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:56,080
你说这就像债务  无法逃避
You say that like it's all debt--inevitable.

394
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,050
Widmore先生告诉我
Mr. Widmore told me

395
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:01,005
Richard Alpert说你要死了
Richard Alpert said that you were going to die.

396
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:03,013
那么告诉我  John
So you tell me, John.

397
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:04,098
这是无可避免  抑或仅仅是个选择
is that inevitable, or is it a choice?

398
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,003
什么  你认为我想死吗
What,you think i wanna die?

399
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:08,081
怎么...
How is that...

400
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:11,089
你怎么可能认为这是种选择
How could you possibly think that's a choice?

401
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:18,040
我只是你的司机
I'm just your driver.

402
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:37,048
Matthew
Matthew!

403
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:44,081
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

404
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:51,083
Jack  你怎么找到我的
Jack,how did you find me?

405
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:53,088
你出了交通意外
You were in a car accident

406
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:56,042
被送进我的医院
and you were brought into my hospital.

407
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:58,050
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

408
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:06,045
我们必须回去
We have to go back.

409
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:10,026
当然
Of course.

410
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:11,024
当然我们得回去
Of course we do.

411
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:13,060
Jack  那些被我留下的人需要我们的帮助
Jack,the people I left behind need our help.

412
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:16,035
我们应该回去  因为那是我们的命运
We're supposed to go back-- because it's our destiny?

413
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:19,009
John  你还要这样和我说多少次
How many times are you gonna say that to me, John?

414
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:21,017
你怎么就不明白
How can you not see it?

415
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:23,068
他们可以送我去任何一个医院
of all the hospitals they could've brought me to,

416
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:26,022
却偏偏送到这里  你认为这不是命运
I end up here. you don't think that's fate?

417
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:29,045
你在洛杉矶西部出事故
Your car accident was on the west side of los angeles.

418
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:32,082
你被送进我在的医院不是命运  John
You being brought into my hospital isn't fate, John.

419
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:33,091
这是概率事件
It's probability.

420
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:35,096
你不明白  那不是个事故
You don't understand. it wasn't an accident.

421
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:38,042
有人要杀了我
Someone is trying to kill me.

422
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,083
为什么  为什么有人要杀你
Why? Why would someone try to kill you?

423
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,022
因为他们不想让我成功
Because they don't want me to succeed.

424
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,016
他们要阻止我
They wanna stop me.

425
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,043
他们不想让我回去 因为我很重要
They don't want me to get back because I'm important.

426
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:52,018
你就没抽空想想
Have you ever stopped to think

427
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:58,034
这些你认为自己很特殊的错觉 不是真实的
that these delusions that you're special aren't real?

428
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,034
可能你根本就没什么重要的
that maybe there's nothing important about you at all?

429
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:05,074
也许你就是个孤独的老头
maybe you are just a lonely old man

430
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:07,087
迫降到一个岛上
that crashed on an island.

431
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,031
仅此而已
that's it.

432
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:14,066
再见了  John
Good-bye,John.

433
00:32:16,023 --> 00:32:19,028
你父亲向你问好
Your father says hello.

434
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,083
什么
What?

435
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:27,052
那个...那个让我移动小岛的人
A man--the man who told me to move the island--

436
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:29,045
那个教我如何把你们都带回去的人
The man who told me how to bring you all back--

437
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:32,001
让我向他儿子问好
He said to tell his son hello.

438
00:32:32,004 --> 00:32:33,041
不可能是Sayid的父亲
It couldn't have been sayid's father,

439
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:37,011
也不是Hurley的父亲  只能是你的了
And it wasn't hurley's, so that leaves you.

440
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:39,023
他说他叫Christian
He said his name was christian.

441
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:44,093
我...
My...

442
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:46,099
我父亲死了
My father is dead.

443
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:48,089
我可看不出他死了
Well,he didn't look dead to me.

444
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:51,070
他三年前死在了澳大利亚
He died in australia three years ago.

445
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,091
我亲手把他放进灵柩
I put him in the coffin!

446
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:56,045
他死了
He's dead.

447
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:58,074
Jack  拜托  你必须回去
Jack,please, you have to come back!

448
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:01,019
你是唯一能说服大家的人
You're the only one who can convince the rest of 'em.

449
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,007
你要帮我  你应该要帮我
You have to help me! you're supposed to help me!

450
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:05,094
John  一切都结束了
John,it's over! it's done.

451
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:09,093
我们早已离开  而且无关紧要  所以你...
We left,and we were never important. so you...

452
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:12,040
你别再纠缠我
You leave me alone.

453
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,059
也别再纠缠其他人
And you leave the rest of 'em alone!

454
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:39,098
Jack  真希望当时你能相信我
Jack, I wish you had believe me.

455
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:48,095
Jack Shephard
Jack Shephard

456
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:47,061
John  John
John? john?

457
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,015
John  你在干什么
John,what are you doing?

458
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:56,059
等等  John  别动
wait,please. john,stop!

459
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,068
你怎么找到我的
H-how did you find me?

460
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:04,077
我派人监视Sayid
I have a man watching sayid.

461
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:08,014
我在监视他们所有人  保证他们安全
I'm watching all of them, keeping them safe.

462
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:10,092
你出现之后  他告诉了我
When you turned up, he called me.

463
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:13,018
谁...是谁...
Who... who...

464
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,027
你...你来这儿干什么
W-w-what are you doing here?

465
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,081
-John  冷静一点  -你想要我怎么样
- John,just calm down. - what do you want from me?!

466
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:19,005
-拜托  让我帮你... -快回答
- Please,let me help-- - Answer the question!

467
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:23,017
-我想保护你  -保护我
- I'm trying to protect you. - Protect me?

468
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:29,070
你杀了他
You shot him.

469
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:31,014
你杀了Abaddon
You killed Abaddon.

470
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:34,073
没错  是我杀的
Yes. Yes,I did.

471
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:37,065
但他迟早会杀了你的
But it was only a matter of time before he tried to kill you.

472
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:39,016
我只是想跟你谈谈
I was just trying to get to you,

473
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:40,051
但你驱车离开然后撞车了
But you drove off and crashed.

474
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:41,087
为什么  为什么要...
Why? Why would--

475
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,002
他是在为Charles Widmore效力
He was working for Charles Widmore.

476
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,015
-他是个危险分子  -不
- He's extremely dangerous. - No!

477
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:49,011
Widmore找到我  他救了我
Widmore came to me. He saved me.

478
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:50,048
不  John  他在利用你
No,John,he used you.

479
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,073
他一直在等待你的出现
He waited till you showed up

480
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:54,023
以便你助他一臂之力  得到小岛
So that you could help him get to the island.

481
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:57,032
正是由于Charles Widmore  我才要移动小岛
Charles Widmore is the reason I moved the island!

482
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,084
那样他就再也找不到它了
So that he could never find it again,

483
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:02,076
只有摆脱了他  你才能成为领导者
To keep him away so that you could lead.

484
00:37:12,015 --> 00:37:15,048
你不能这么做
You can't do this.

485
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:18,078
如果你有个三长两短...
If anything happens to you...

486
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:22,027
John  你根本没意识到自己的重要性
John,you have no idea how important you are.

487
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:26,043
让我来帮你
Let me help you.

488
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:32,069
没人能帮我
There is no helping me.

489
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,058
我...
I'm...

490
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:41,076
-不  John  你不是  -我是
- No,John,you're not. - I am!

491
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,089
我无法说服他们任何人
I couldn't get any of them.

492
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:48,085
无法说服他们任何人跟我一起回去
I couldn't get a single one of them to come back with me.

493
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:50,098
我根本当不了领导者
I can't lead anyone.

494
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,048
Jack订了张机票
Jack booked a ticket.

495
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:57,089
什么
W-what?

496
00:37:57,092 --> 00:38:00,057
一张从洛杉矶到悉尼的机票  今晚启程
A plane ticket from Los Angeles to Sydney,tonight.

497
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,045
明晨最早航班返回
Return trip first thing in the morning.

498
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,025
无论你和他说了什么  John  见效了
Whatever you said to him, John--it worked.

499
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:13,086
一旦你说服了Jack
And if you got jack,

500
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:15,090
其他人就好办了
You can get the rest of them.

501
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,093
John
John...

502
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:26,009
你不能死
You can't die.

503
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,093
你还有许多事情要做
You've got too much work to do.

504
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:31,041
我们还等着你重回小岛
We've gotta get you back to that island

505
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:33,052
你一定能成功的
So that you can do it.

506
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:50,098
求求你  John
Please,john.

507
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:52,086
来吧
Come on.

508
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:59,053
下来
Come down.

509
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:19,028
相信我们会成功的  John
I know we can do this, john.

510
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:22,087
你还没去找Sun呢
You haven't even been to Sun yet.

511
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,070
我们从她入手吧
Let's start with her.

512
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:27,048
不  我...
No. I...

513
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:32,009
我答应过Jin不会带她回去
I promised Jin that I wouldn't bring her back.

514
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:33,067
Jin还活着
Jin is alive?

515
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:36,064
对  对  但他不想让她知道
Yeah. Yeah. But he didn't want her to know.

516
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:40,034
他...他要我跟她说...
He--he wanted me to tell her that his...

517
00:39:40,038 --> 00:39:44,009
他的尸体被冲上了沙滩
That his body washed up on the beach.

518
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:47,030
然后  他把结婚戒指给我作为证据
And,uh,he gave me his wedding ring to prove it.

519
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:49,004
好吧
All right.

520
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:51,047
答应了就不能食言
A promise is a promise.

521
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,001
谢谢
Thank you.

522
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:08,058
别客气
You're welcome.

523
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:09,097
来吧
Come on.

524
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:19,028
我们走
Let's go.

525
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:22,037
相信我们会成功的
I know we can do this.

526
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,085
一旦能把他们聚在一起...
Once we can get them all in the same place...

527
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,076
我不知道接下去该怎么办
I don't know where we go from there,

528
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,033
但总会想出办法来的
But we'll figure something out.

529
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:32,071
我知道该去找谁
I know where we go.

530
00:40:32,074 --> 00:40:35,059
洛杉矶有个女人
There's a woman here in Los Angeles.

531
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:36,063
女人
A woman?

532
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:38,082
对  我不知道确切位置
Yeah,i don't know exactly where,

533
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:41,057
但找她应该不太难
But she shouldn't be that hard to find.

534
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,028
她叫...
Her name is--is,uh...

535
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:45,088
Eloise Hawking
Eloise Hawking.

536
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:49,096
Eloise Hawking  你确定吗
Eloise hawking? You sure?

537
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:52,067
对  没错  怎么了  你认识她吗
yeah,yeah. Yeah,why? Do you know her?

538
00:40:54,063 --> 00:40:57,031
没错  John  我认识她
Yes. John. I know her.

539
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,020
我会想念你的  John
I'll miss you, John

540
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:44,019
一定会的
I really will

541
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:15,097
那个标志
That symbol

542
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:19,060
属于一个叫达摩计划的组织
Belongs to an organization called Dharma Initiative

543
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:23,047
他们之前在这里进行了一系列实验
They were conducting some experients here a while back

544
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:26,013
你怎么知道的
How do you know that

545
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:29,017
我在这个岛上待了一百多天  我知道很多事
I Spent more than a hundred days on this island I know a lot

546
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:30,052
一百多天
A hundred days

547
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,052
那么我们坠机的时候  你就已经在这里了
So when we crashed, you were already here

548
00:43:34,062 --> 00:43:38,014
不  我离开过这里
No, no, I left

549
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:40,052
那是多久之前的事了
How long ago did you live

550
00:43:42,014 --> 00:43:45,040
算起时间来  会弄晕了你的
It's timing It would just confuse you

551
00:43:45,046 --> 00:43:48,072
那你有时怎么回来的呢
Well, how did you get back

552
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:50,098
老实说  我也参不透
To be honest, that part is a bit mystery to me

553
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:53,055
好吧  John Locke
Ok, John Locke,

554
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,095
我也有件参不透的事
I have a mystery too

555
00:43:58,018 --> 00:43:59,051
没准能帮到你
Maybe it can help you with

556
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:02,004
愿闻其详
I am happy you try

557
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:05,027
在飞机上的时候  我旁边过道的另一侧
On the plane, I was sitting across the aisle

558
00:44:05,027 --> 00:44:07,027
坐着一个卷发的大块头
from a really big guy with curly hair

559
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:10,094
当飞机狂震的时候  震得厉害
When the plane started shaking, really shaking

560
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:13,065
有巨大的噪音  还有一道强光
There was a big noise and a bright light

561
00:44:14,025 --> 00:44:18,038
这个卷发的大块头就消失了
And this really big guy with curly hair was gone, man

562
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,078
毫不夸张  他消失了  不光有他
I mean literally gone. And it wasn't only him

563
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:25,013
我们当中还有人目击别的人也同样消失了
