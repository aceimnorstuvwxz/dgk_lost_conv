5
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:21,098
我说过我会照顾你

Sayid

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,010
这岛上不光只有我们
We're not alone.

9
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,020
有人看到Ethan了吗?
Has anyone seen Ethan?

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,013
恩  恩  他去海滩了

11
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:34,055
-Charlie去哪儿了?  -他去找Claire了
-Where's Charlie?  -He went after Claire.

12
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:37,072
脚印  这里到处都是三种不同的脚印
Footprints, three distinct sets, all over the place.

13
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:39,059
我看他们被劫走了
I think they've been taken.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,015
Claire

15
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:44,014
他们想要的就是Claire
All they wanted was Claire.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,010
Walt

17
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:51,027
Walt

18
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:55,002
Walt

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,043
Walt

20
00:00:57,043 --> 00:00:59,013
嘿  Michael  看到Claire的包了吗?
Hey Michael  Have you seen Claire's bags?

21
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:01,002
-看到我儿子了吗?  -看到她的包了吗?
-Have you seen my son?  -Have you seen her bags?

22
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,082
她的行李, 没拿到这来
Her luggage. It's not been brought back here.

23
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:05,009
看来没人知道到哪儿去了
No one seems to know what's happened to it.

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,047
不好意思 兄弟 我不知道  我在找Walt
Sorry, man. I don't know. I'm just looking for Walt.

25
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:11,021
是这样 不好意思  我没看到他
Oh. Got it. Sorry. I've not seen him.

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,056
Jack 你在那边看到我儿子了吗?
Hey, Jack. You seen my boy when you were out there?

27
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:17,023
没有  他当时在山洞那边
No. He was at the caves.

28
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:18,077
恩  他遛狗去了
Yeah, he took his dog for a walk.

29
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,035
我和他说别往远处走...
Told him to stay close as usual.

30
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:23,022
你10岁的时候听你老爸的话  是吧
You listened to your old man when you were ten,right?

31
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:24,094
呃  恩
Uh, yeah.

32
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,074
恩  我听  可能有点太听话了
I listened. Maybe a little too well.

33
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:29,033
老兄  新一轮的比赛要开始了
Yo,dudes,got a new tourney lined up.

34
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,029
看谁能赢得最后一支除臭棒
We're playing for the last of the deodorant sticks.

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,043
打会儿高尔夫不?
You dawgs up for some golf?

36
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:34,074
我要去找我孩子
I gotta go find my kid.

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,084
如果看到了Walt
Hey,if Walt shows up,

38
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:39,026
告诉他在这儿等我回来
tell him to stay right here until I get back.

39
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:42,016
一定
You got it.

40
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:44,076
-Walt  -看起来他厌烦了  是吧
-Walt!  -He seems to hate it, doesn't he?

41
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:48,006
-什么  -当一名父亲
-What?  -Being a dad.

42
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,001
不  只是...
No, it's just...

43
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:53,020
-一刻不得闲呐  -Walt
-a lot of hard work.  -Walt

44
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:55,075
Walt

45
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:58,046
不  是他厌烦了
Nah, he hates it.

46
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:00,081
Walt

47
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:10,089
Walt

48
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:17,094
Walt

49
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,034
就是这个了
This is the one.

50
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,056
这个肯定就是我宝宝的婴儿床了
This is definitely my baby's crib.

51
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:27,043
漂亮啊
Beautiful.

52
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:30,032
放在我们将要住的小通道里会很棒
It'll look great in the alley we'll be living in.

53
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,065
这要三个月的租金那
This is three months' rent.

54
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,081
什么  不是三个...
What? It's not three...

55
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,097
你难道不想孩子过的好吗?
Look, don't you want the best for this kid?

56
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:39,086
我知道你很激动  但Michael我们买不起
I know you're excited, but Michael we can't afford this.

57
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:41,043
我们的宝宝在这婴儿床上
Our baby in this crib.

58
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:44,093
拜托  那会是个开心的小家伙
Come on. That's a happy kid.

59
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:48,006
我和Andy谈了
Hey I talked to Andy.

60
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,063
他说他能给我找点活干
 He said he can throw some work my way.

61
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:51,039
建筑吗?  那你的艺术怎么办呢?
Construction? What about your art?

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,027
不  不  不
No. No. No.

63
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:54,004
我不会放弃  只是想放下一段时间
I'm not giving it up. I'm just gonna take a break

64
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:56,049
到你完成了法学院的学业再说
until you finish law school.

65
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,040
通过律师考试  被某不错的法律公司高薪聘用
Pass the bar, get hired by some fancy-ass, high-paying law firm.

66
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,059
有人把一切都计划好了
Somebody's got it all figured.

67
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,015
恩  我最终还会回去画画
Yeah,I'll get back to painting eventually.

68
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:07,072
与此同时  你将会习以为常的...
Meanwhile, you can support me and Walt...

69
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:11,046
支持我和Walt
in the manner to which we'll soon become accustomed.

70
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,032
Walt  是吗?
"Walt" huh?

71
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,074
我想喜欢这样
I'd like to do that, you know.

72
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:17,049
让他随我父亲的名字
Name him after my dad.

73
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:21,071
Walter

74
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:24,029
Walter Lloyd

75
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,056
Lloyd

76
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:28,024
好吧  就因为这你才不愿嫁给我
Oh, all right. That's why you won't marry me.

77
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,058
而不是因为你认为婚姻生活枯燥无味
It's not that marriage is too prosaic.

78
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,021
你只是想要他随你姓
You want him to have your last name.

79
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:35,050
你还想不想让我同意Walter了
Hey, you want me to agree to "Walter," or what?

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,033
天  我逊毙了
Man, I suck.

81
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:51,066
你能做的更好
You can do better than that.

82
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,036
你别逼他就好
You might wanna take it easy on him.

83
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:55,049
看到这个结了吗  Walt?
See this knot, Walt?

84
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,089
你就瞄准它  就瞄这儿
I want you to aim for it. Right here.

85
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,037
全神贯注  好吗?
Focus on it. All right?

86
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:04,069
用你心灵之眼来想象一下
Picture it in your mind's eye.

87
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,031
你知道什么是心灵之眼吧
You know what that is, right? the mind's eye?

88
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:07,064
就象是在脑袋里形成一幅画
Like a picture in your head.

89
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:11,031
说的对  再来一次  但要看到才行
That's Right.Now do it again, but see it.

90
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:14,018
在你投出去之前要先看到
See it before you do it.

91
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,099
看到那条轨迹
Visualize the path.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,068
看到那轨迹
See it.

93
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,074
看到那轨迹
See it.

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,040
-哇噢  -好唉
-Whoa.  -Yes!

95
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,012
我就知道你有那潜质  Walt
I knew you had it in you, Walt

96
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:37,089
怪了  我真的...
It was weird. I actually saw it

97
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,055
在我心里看到了  象是真的一样
in my mind or something, like it was real.

98
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:40,060
谁说不是呢
Who's to say it wasn't?

99
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:44,009
这是怎么回事
Hey! What the hell is going on?

100
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:45,074
-给我  -但是我...
-Gimme that.  -But I...

101
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:47,042
带Vincent回营地去
Take Vincent and go back to camp.

102
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:49,074
-可Locke先生在...  -快  小子
-But Mr. Locke was...  -Now, little man.

103
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:03,046
你给我孩子一把刀?
You gave my boy a knife?

104
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,003
你该先看看...
You should've seen...

105
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,007
用不着你告诉我该看什么  老兄
Don't tell me what I should've seen, man.

106
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:08,022
这要是在家里  我就去报案抓你了
If we were back home, I'd call the police on your ass!

107
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,046
教唆孩子从他老爸那溜走
Encouraging a kid to sneak away from his parent.

108
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,082
给他这样的一把刀
Giving him a knife like this?

109
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:13,014
Walt自己能分辨是非
Walt knows his own mind.

110
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:15,012
别说得像你了解他似的!
Don't talk to me about my son like you know him!

111
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:16,031
你冷静一下吧
You really need to calm down.

112
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:18,034
你如果继续让我儿子和我作对
You keep playing my son against me

113
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:20,036
我就会...
and I'm gonna have a...

114
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:25,031
人家说让你冷静
The man said "calm down"

115
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,041
-你算哪根葱 他的走狗吗?  -冷静 冷静 冷静
-What are you, his attack dog?  -Easy easy easy

116
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,015
是你拿把刀挥来挥去的
You are the one who was waving the knife around.

117
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:33,084
他只是不想让你伤到人
He was just trying to make sure you didn't hurt someone.

118
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:39,007
Michael  我知道...
Michael, I know...

119
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,010
你和你儿子之间沟通困难
 it's been difficult to bond with your son.

120
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,088
你知道他为什么喜欢跟我在一起吗?
You know why he's formed an attached to me?

121
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,093
因为我把他当作大人来看待
Because I treat him like an adult.

122
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,008
可你还是把他当成孩子
and you still treat him like a boy.

123
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,064
他10岁
He's ten years old.

124
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:49,061
他所经历的要比有些人一辈子经历的还要多
He's been through more than most people in their entire lifetime.

125
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:52,002
你没和他在一起多久所以你不知道
You haven't spent enough time with him to see it

126
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,078
但他与众不同
but he's different.

127
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,066
你说什么
What did you say?

128
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,046
这不是家里  Michael
And we're not back home, Michael

129
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:58,029
只要我们在这儿
As long as we're here

130
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,060
我觉得你该让他认识到他的潜能
I think Walt should be allowed to realize his potential.

131
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,012
离我儿子...
You stay away from my son...

132
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:13,098
和我远点儿
and me.

133
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,086
你不能带走他
You're not taking him.

134
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:22,068
不能带走我儿子
You're not taking my son.

135
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:25,027
你想走可以走  但Walt要留下
You can go if you want to, but Walt stays with me.

136
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,002
我是想和你商量一下
I'm trying to have a discussion with you.

137
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:29,066
你说的是要去阿姆斯特丹...
You're talking about going to Amsterdam...

138
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:32,011
只有你和他  这怎么能算是商量呢?
just you and him. How is that a discussion?

139
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:34,015
是工作的机会  Michael  那是工作地点
It's an offer, Michael, and that's where the job is.

140
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:35,079
你说过你快乐啊
You said you were happy.

141
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,006
那"法律诊所挺适合我"又算作什么?
What about the legal clinic being a good fit?

142
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:41,041
-你说过的  -千载难逢的机会啊
-You said that.  -This is a huge opportunity.

143
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,068
你知道我一直期盼做国际法
YOu know I've always wanted to do International Law.

144
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:45,043
我是该在这儿替你高兴吗?
Am I supposed to be happy for you over here?

145
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:48,045
为你那"千载难逢的机会"高兴吗?
for your huge opportunity?

146
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:59,058
我们谈论过要分开一段时间
We've talked about taking some time apart.

147
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:05,028
宝贝儿  我以为那是...
Look, babe, I thought that was...

148
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,034
我们谈论过很多事
Hey, we said a lot of things.

149
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:11,001
你说你想在一条船上住
You said you wanted to live on a boat.

150
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,093
我还是爱你的
I still love you.

151
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:17,052
这你知道  可我...
You know I do, but I...

152
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:21,054
Michael  这么短时间里我们经历的太多了
Michael  we've been through so much in such a short time.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,065
宝贝儿  我们有分歧  可那正常啊
Babe, we got problems. That's what people have.

154
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,009
你想去咨询吗?
You wanna go to counseling?

155
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,008
我没问题  我们走吧
I'm down with that. Let's go.

156
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:29,052
好吗
All right?

157
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,073
噢  天
Oh, man

158
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:42,027
你已经接受了  是吧?
You already took it, didn't you?

159
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,024
那份工作
The job.

160
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:47,004
恩  是的
Yeah, I did.

161
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,071
你已经几个月没工作了
You haven't worked in months.

162
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,016
建筑业在冬季很低靡
Construction slows in the winter.

163
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:55,021
-这我和你说过  -我可以给他一切
-I already told you.  -I can provide for him

164
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:56,048
我会给他他所需要的一切
I'll give him everything he needs.

165
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:59,009
除了他老爸  你不能带走他  不能
Except for his dad.He's not going with you! No!

166
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,074
你真要为这事和我争吵吗?
You wanna argue with me about this?

167
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:02,072
奶奶的  说对了  这种事法律上是站不住脚的
Hell.Yes. There are laws against this kinda thing.

168
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:04,054
我们还没结婚  Michael
We're not married, Michael.

169
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:06,069
我是他母亲并且有稳定的工作
I'm his mother, and I'm steadily employed.

170
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,028
你说法庭会把他判给谁
Who do you think the court's gonna side with?

171
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:19,094
这并不是永远说再见
This is not goodbye forever.

172
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:26,052
我只是...
I just...

173
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:29,004
我需要些时间
I need some time.

174
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:53,083
你没事吧
Are you all right?

175
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,065
恩  我没事
Nah  I'm okay.

176
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,035
谢了
Thanks.

177
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,030
还是不知道怎么和他沟通
I just don't know how to talk to him.

178
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,061
怎么让他...
How to get him to...

179
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:10,042
让他知道我站在他那一边
you know, understand I'm on his side.

180
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:16,077
Locke说我不该再把他当作孩子看了
Locke says I should stop treating him like a child.

181
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:19,066
我错过了他整个的童年  所以...
I missed his whole childhood, so...

182
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:27,013
不能这样
It just can't happen.

183
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,043
什么?
What?

184
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,060
他不能在这儿长大
He can't grow up here.

185
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,059
他不能在这儿长大
He can't grow in this place.

186
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:45,062
当我认识到这些方程式是些坐标...
Once I realized these equations were coordinates...

187
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:47,027
经纬度...
latitude and longitude...

188
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:50,098
我猜想那法国女人是想要确定这岛的方位
I assumed the french woman was trying to determine the location of the island.

189
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:52,058
可并未完成
But it was incomplete

190
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,047
她作的记号七零八碎
her notations fragmented

191
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:56,044
除了那首鱼谣
Except for the fish song.

192
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,069
恩那
Mm-hmm.

193
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,056
什么
The what?

194
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:01,052
当我把纸象这样放着的时候
When I lay the pages down like this

195
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:06,051
我发现这不是表明这座岛的方位
I realized it wasn't showing the location of the island.

196
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:11,011
我看是这岛上的方位  特指这里
I think it's a location on the island.Specifically, here.

197
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,065
那相对于三角形来说我们的位置在哪儿?
So where are we in relation to the triangle?

198
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:17,016
这地图比例不准  所以我也不知道
Well, the map is hardly at scale,so I don't know.

199
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,098
我们甚至都不确定这是否是这座岛的地图 对吧?
We're not even sure it's a map of this island, are we?

200
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,016
对  不知道
We're not.no.

201
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:24,086
但这也许是发送器发出求救信号和它电源的地方
This may be the transmitter sending out her distress call,and its power source.

202
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:26,078
在谈什么呢?
What are we talking about doing now?

203
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,010
在想方设法被追捕 被森林里的东西干掉吗?
loking for another excuse to get chased down and killed by whatever lives in the jungle?

204
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:33,043
伙计们  我们不能再这样下去了...
Guys, we can't keep doing this.

205
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:36,031
建造水过滤系统和打高尔夫
Building water filtration systems,and playing golf.

206
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:38,086
把这当成温暖的家  我们要离开这座岛
making a sweet home here. We need to get off this island!

207
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,070
你以为谁想这样吗?
You think any of us wanna be here?

208
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:44,002
不  可我看现在谁都没有我回家的愿望那么强烈
No. But I don't think anyone wants to get off as much as I do right now.

209
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:45,086
那你有什么好办法吗?
So, are you suggesting something?

210
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:47,039
恩
Yeah.

211
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,005
我们造一个木筏
We build a raft.

212
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:50,010
木筏
A raft?

213
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,064
别用那种语气跟我说话  老兄
Don't say it like that, man

214
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,073
我们要有点乐观精神  知道吗?
We need a little optimism here,okay?

215
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:56,062
我们要做点事情  因为说实话
And we gotta do something, 'cause,let's be honest,

216
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:58,062
没人会来了
no one's coming.

217
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,047
我们在机舱里拿的那些座位...就可以漂着
Those seats we took off the fuselage, they float.

218
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:03,025
我们还有一把斧头
And we got an axe.

219
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:06,021
还有一大片树林  竹子
And a whole bunch of trees, bamboo.

220
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:07,063
我们做得到的
We can do this.

221
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,049
在惊涛骇浪中生存的机会...
The chances of surviving the rough waters...

222
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,015
找到一条航线的几率...
The odds of finding a shipping lane...

223
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,040
我还严重晕船
And I get really seasick.

224
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:17,065
好极了  留在这吧
You know what? Great. Stay here.

225
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,007
度过今生  祝你们好运吧
Grow old, good luck to you.

226
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:21,030
但我要这么做  我儿子和我要离开这儿
But I'm doing this. My son and I are leaving.

227
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:24,045
谁要帮我们造的话会得到上帝的保佑
Anybody that wants to help us build,  God bless you.

228
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:11,020
嘿  Walt
Hey, Walt.

229
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:12,050
嘿  走
Hey, come on.

230
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,084
我需要你帮点忙
I need your help with something.

231
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:15,060
我在做事
I'm doing stuff.

232
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:18,088
你在看西班牙文的漫画 你又不懂西班牙文
You're reading comics in Spanish, and you don't read Spanish, man.

233
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,089
我喜欢这些画
I like the pictures.

234
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:25,000
你喜欢艺术  是吧
You like the art, huh?

235
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,015
是吧
I guess so.

236
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:31,089
我像你那么大的时候...也许比你还大点...
You know, when I was your age, I don't know, maybe a little older,

237
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,057
我总是映描漫画
I traced comics.

238
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:36,001
自学透视画法  你知道是什么吗
Taught myself about perspective.You know what that is?

239
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,090
透视画法
Perspective?

240
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,068
嘿
Hey.

241
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:43,097
我说要你帮忙  走
I said I need your help. Let's go.

242
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:44,072
为什么我要去
Why do I have to come?

243
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:48,002
因为我知道我一眼盯不住你就会怎样
Because I've seen what happens when I don't keep an eye on you.

244
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,088
让我和他说说话
Let me talk to him.

245
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,082
他才21个月  不会用电话
He's 21 months old. He doesn't use the phone.

246
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,001
我说就行
I'll do all the talking.

247
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:59,026
只是想让他听听我的声音
I just want him to hear my voice.

248
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,029
-我想他  -我知道
-I miss him.  -I know.

249
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,045
我回头打给你  好吗?
Let me call you back, okay?

250
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,034
现在不方便

251
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:05,080
-我们走吧  -嘘 是Michael

255
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:13,018

259
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,072
-知道有什么用呢  -是谁?
-Does it make any difference?  -Who is it?

260
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,094
Brian Porter

261
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,058
聘用你的那个人
The guy who hired you.

262
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:29,061
-不是你想的那样  -那你说你需要时间来考虑
-It wasn't like that before.  -So when you said you needed time to think...

263
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:30,077
你我之间的时候,你是在说谎了?
about us, you were just lying.?

-不是  我确实是  然后我... -我去阿姆斯特丹

我要把我儿子带回来

268
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,010
快叫救护车! 救救他!

269
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,027
Charlie?

这些是Claire的东西  谁放到这儿的
These are Claire's things. Who brought them here?

271
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,097
是我  怎么了  你在干什么
I did. Why? What are you doing?

272
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:06,064
找不到了  去哪儿了呢
I can't find it. I don't know where it is.

273
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:08,017

Claire的日记
Claire's diary

She kept her diary in this side pocket.I know because I saw her put it there.

276
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,031
有人拿走了
Someone's taken it.

277
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,054
再问一次  我们在找什么
What are we looking for again?

278
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:21,056
长金属棒或塑料管
Any long piece of metal or plastic tubing.

279
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:22,084
任何能当作...
Anything that looks like...

280
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:24,089
框架的东西
it'd work as a frame.

281
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:26,093
拿框架干什么
A frame for what?

282
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:28,086
你很快就会知道的

283
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:31,002
嘿  把坐垫  塑料  油布归类
Hey,separate the cushions, the plastic, the tarp.

284
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:34,034
把你找到的东西都分类摆放  那样容易区分
Put everything you find in different piles so we can take stock.

285
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,044
是在惩罚我吗?
Am I being punished?

286
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,046
什么  和你老头子在一起干活就是惩罚你吗?

287
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,011
不是的  小子
No man

288
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:47,012
是我们在掌控自己命运
It's just us taking control of our destiny.

289
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:50,049
感觉是在惩罚我
Feels like punishment.

290
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,094
Sawyer...

291
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,034
嘿  Sawyer
Hey Sawyer

292
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:01,009
其实,我可以直接进去
You know, I could just go inside.

293
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,097
敬酒还是罚酒
Trick or treat.

294
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,010
你二人今天要卖些什么呢?
So, what are you two selling today?

295
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:08,063
Claire的日记在哪儿
Where's Claire's diary?

296
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,090
有人从她包里拿走了
Someone took it from her bag.

297
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:12,046
噢  我懂了
Oh, I get it.

298
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:13,039
东西一丢
Something goes missing

299
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,034
你立刻就会想到是我拿的
and right away you figure it's gotta be me that took it.

300
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,080
你到底拿没拿那日记?
Do you have the diary or not?

301
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,051
说的是这个吗?
You mean this one?

302
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,018
给我
Give it to me.

303
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,029
我看不好吧
I'm not sure that's the best idea.

304
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,027
或许Claire小姐们儿不乐意让你看呢
Maybe Missy Claire don't want you reading it.

305
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,035
我没想要看
I wasn't gonna read it.

306
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:30,030
你就不好奇她怎么描述你的吗?
You're not curious what she wrote about you?

307
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:32,084
你个混蛋  你看了吗?
You bastard. Did you read it?

308
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:34,070
这附近好的文学作品不多
Good literature's kinda scarce around here.

309
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,024
他看了!
He read it!

310
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,032
给我们吧
Just give it to us.

311
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:39,030
"亲爱的日记  我被过气的...

314
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,057

"日记  英国的小矮子还是弃而不舍"
"Diary, the little limey runt just won't let up."

316
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,067
你打的象个娘们儿
You hit like a ponce.

317
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:56,018
-噢  是吗?  -好了  够了
-Oh, yeah?  -All right, enough.

318
00:15:57,076 --> 00:16:00,015
你其实没看过  是吧
You didn't really read it, did you?

319
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:03,001
只是还没来得及看
I just hadn't gotten around to it yet.

320
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:29,000
我去拿些水
I'm gonna get some water.

321
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,035

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,058

好吗  谢谢
Please and thank you.

325
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,053
我还真得多练练
You gotta work on that.

326
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,060
Boone

327
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:48,017
你们还要继续空手而归吗?
So you guys are just gonna keep coming back without any food?

328
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:50,026
嘿  我说正经的呐
Hey, I'm serious.

329
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:54,001
你怎么了  Boone
What's going on with you,Boone?

330
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:55,073
你好怪异啊
Could you be acting any weirder?

331
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:57,004
Shannon

332
00:16:57,005 --> 00:17:00,019
你自从初中就得了贪食症
You've been a functioning bulimic since junior high.

333
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,098
我想如果能减一两个尺码你会很激动吧
I thought you'd be excited about dropping a size or two.

334
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:07,060
既然你总是空手而归
Well,since you're not having any luck with the hunting,

335
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:09,024
也许你该去帮一下Michael

他在造木筏

337

我还想去帮他呢
I was thinking I would help him out.

338
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:16,028
也许最后会从这儿出去

你帮我好吗?

你父亲不愿意让我们在一起
Your father doesn't want us spending time together.

342
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:41,040
他又不是我老大
He's not the boss of me.

343
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:43,058
可他是你父亲

你怎么回事?
What is wrong with you?

-I was just coming to see...  -I told you to stay away from my son!

350

-He didn't.I was just...  -Walt I don't want to hear it from you!

351
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:06,006
我只是让他把这铅笔带给你

把它当作是...

我要是再看到你和我儿子在一起
I catch you with my son again

356
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:21,013
我就干掉你
I'll kill you.

357
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:39,075
你个混蛋
You're a jerk.

358
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,069
你说我什么?
What did you say to me?

359
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,053
Locke没做错什么  他是我的朋友!
Mr Locke didn't do anything. He's my friend!

360
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,099
现在不是了
He's not anymore.

361
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,012
是我在照顾你

-What?  -You only showed up after Mom died.

364
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,005
我小时候你到哪儿去了  没影了吧
Where were you when I was growing up,huh? Nowhere!

365
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,054
听着  Walt  这一言难尽
Listen, Walt. It's complicated.

366
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:56,037
我才不管  你不是我父亲
I don't even care! You're not my father!

367
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:01,058
你要恨我吗?
You wanna hate me?

368

你应该保护好她的东西

He thinks 'cause I'm new to Australian law that I'm some kind of yokel or something.

475
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:46,037

670
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,069
只是梦而已  Charlie

671
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,085
不  Sayid先前提到过黑岩
No. Sayid mentioned the black rock before.

672

但半夜去那森林里...
But there's no sense...

679
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:21,014
是不理智的
going out into the jungle in the middle of the night.

你不是什么都听得见  Boone
