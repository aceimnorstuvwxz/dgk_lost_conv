00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:03,031
剧情回顾...
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:04,026
问你个问题
Can I ask you something?

3
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:05,054
说吧  老兄
Anything,Pal

4
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:09,032
你是怎么知道Claire溺水的?
How do you know Claire was drowning?

5
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:23,089
Claire!
Claire!

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,005
我听到了她的求救
I could hear her calling for help

7
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:31,089
那你也能听到闪电咯?
You...heard the lightning as well?

8
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,046
我不是在救Claire  Charlie
I wasn't saving Claire,Charlie

9
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,098
我是在救你
I was saving you

10
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:54,065
当我看到闪电雷击顶棚时你被电死了
When I saw the lightning hit the roof you were electrocuted

11
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,024
当你得知Claire溺水时  你...
and when you heard Claire was in the water...

12
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:01,055
你想救她  但你自己却被淹死了
You drowned trying to save her

13
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:08,085
我尽力了  我尽力救了你两次但不论我怎么努力...
I've tried,brother,I've tried twice to save you but no matter what I try to do...

14
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:12,032
你都是要死的Charlie
You're gonna die,Charlie

15
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:26,052
你疯了吗?  老兄 
You're insane,mate

16
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:31,015
超人能瞬间环绕地球
Superman can fly round the entire planet in the blink of an eye

17
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:36,041
伙计  如果是赛跑的话超人是远远比不上闪电侠的
Dude,if we're going by a pure foot race Supes would get dusted by the Flash

18
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:40,030
为什么超级英雄会参加赛跑呢?
But why would the man of steel agree to a sodding foot race?

19
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:42,058
估计是为了慈善?
Uh,for charity?

20
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:46,088
闪电侠一定能取胜他能震动大地并躲过一切障碍物
And Flash would totally win,'cause he can,like vibrate through walls and stuff

21
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:48,071
震动啊!
Vibration

22
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:51,049
如果超人面前有一面墙他会怎么做呢?
Well,and what would Superman do if he came against a wall?

23
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,099
他不能打碎它
Well,no smashing allowed

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,072
不能飞  不能使用那些超能力
No flying,no smashing

25
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,078
那个比赛还有其他限制吗?
Any other restrictions I need to know about?

26
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:03,040
也许我们该给超人配个氪星石...
Perhaps we should fit superman with a pair of kryptonite...

27
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:07,065
什么鬼东西?
The hell?

28
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,069
Claire!
Claire!

29
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,086
- 不要碰他  - 我的天啊!
-No,don't! Don't touch it.  -My God,my God!

30
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:17,000
呼吸  尽量呼吸
Just breathe

31
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:19,022
看上去这像是自制的  我们得回去
Looks like it's homemade.We've got to get back

32
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:23,001
- 不  你来帮他!  - 我帮不了他!
-No! You help!  -I can't help!

33
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:27,091
我很抱歉  老兄
I'm sorry,mate

34
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:47,030
这里  在这里
Here it is. Here it is

35
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:51,070
超人能瞬间环绕地球...
Superman can fly around the entire planet...

36
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:27,027
那根电缆在哪里?
Where's the wire?

37
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:29,041
你是不是吃了不该吃的东西?
Did you eat those mushrooms Jack warned us about?

38
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,091
听着
Listen to me

39
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:34,095
有根电缆被埋在沙子里
There's a wire,a cable buried in the sand

40
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:37,097
你知道我在说什么吗?
Do you know what I'm talking about?

41
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:39,008
又是那些预感  是吗?
This is future crap,isn't it?

42
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,058
这根电缆  你知道它在哪里吗?
The cable! Do you know where it is?

43
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:44,010
这很重要
This is important

44
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:47,047
为什么?
Why?

45
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:52,000
超人
Superman...

46
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:58,099
因为有个人即将到来
Because someone's coming

57
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:53,026
上帝通过各种方式来考验我们的信念
God tests our faith in many ways

58
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:57,023
如你所知  我们也有自己的方式
So,as you well know,we have our own test here...

59
00:04:57,024 --> 00:05:01,036
沉默的誓言定能长存
A vow of silence that lasts as long as we see fits

60
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:07,024
这不仅是挑战人的意志也是在挑战人的信念
This challenge is both one's patience...and his faith

61
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:11,007
对某些人来说可能要用一周的时间
For some,it may last a week

62
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:14,073
还有一些人需要一个月
Those we're less sure about,a month

63
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:21,021
我以前从没认为你会坚持的 ...
Personally,Desmond I never thought you'd last...

64
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:25,039
但现在我得承认自己错了
and so now I stand corrected

65
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,014
不管是什么原因  你的道路指引你来到这里
For whatever reason,your path has led you here

66
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:36,091
并成为我们中的一员
And now you're one of us

67
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:40,030
欢迎你  修士
Welcome,brother

68
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:47,010
谢谢  修士
Thank you...Brother

69
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:55,082
早上好Jack 
Morning,Jack

70
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,087
在自己床上醒来感觉不错吧!
Must be nice to wake up in your own bed

71
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:04,035
是啊  家  温馨的家
yea,Home,sweet home

72
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:08,096
我能借一下急救箱吗?
So I was wondering if I could borrow your first aid kit

73
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:14,049
我的脚扭了
I've...twisted my ankle

74
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:19,078
- 要我看看吗?  - 不用了  谢谢
-You want me to take a look at it?  -No,you're all right

75
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,030
- 我自己包扎过了  - 好吧
-I've taped my share of ankles. -Right

76
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:30,085
谢谢
Thanks

77
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:34,023
有什么不对劲吗  Hurley?
Something wrong,Hurley?

78
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:37,019
没事  只是...
No,just...

79
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,081
继续让Desmond和我们在一起
keeping Desmond here company

80
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:44,098
因为我们是朋友了
'cause we're friends

81
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:49,047
- 别忘了还我  行吗?  - 当然
-Bring that back when you're done with it,okay?  -Absolutely

82
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,009
你刚才都讲了些什么?
What the hell was that?

83
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,079
你想引起他的怀疑吗?
Do you want him to get suspicious?

84
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,000
怀疑什么?
Suspicious of what?

85
00:06:57,052 --> 00:07:00,049
比如那时你知道Claire要淹死  是吗?
Oh,this is like when you knew Claire was drowning,isn't it?

86
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,013
你要急救箱就是为了保险一定有人会受伤
That's why you got the first aid kit.Someone's gonna get hurt

87
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:05,081
- 是我吗?  - 不是  以防万一罢了
-Is it me?  -No. It's just a precaution

88
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:08,058
伙计  你不是要我带你去找电缆吗?
Look,dude,you want me to take you to the wire?

89
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:12,083
你给我个合理的解释
I want an explanation

90
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:24,047
我看到了一连串事情...即将发生的事情
I saw a sequence of events...things that are gonna happen

91
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:25,093
你看到了什么?
What did you see?

92
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:31,096
就像一块拼图  只不过我还不知道那图案是什么
It was...It was like a sort of jigsaw puzzle only I didn't have the picture on the box

93
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:33,068
我还不知道要怎么把这些拼凑起来
so I don't know how the pieces fit exactly

94
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:38,081
但其中的一块  那第一块...
But...one of the pieces,The first one...

95
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,015
就是你把电缆从沙子里拉了出来
It was you,pulling the cable out of the sand

96
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:48,051
那其余的部分呢?
So what are the other pieces?

97
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:52,063
如果我告诉你的话图案就会被破坏
If I tell you that,it'll change the picture on the box

98
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,036
那又怎么样?
So what?

99
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:57,073
我们要做的不就是阻止坏事发生吗?
Isn't that the point...Preventing something bad?

100
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:59,015
这次不是
Not this time

101
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:03,040
这么说你不想阻止那些事的发生...
So you're not trying to stop something from happening

102
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:08,008
你想让它顺其自然
You actually want it to happen

103
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:19,071
胜过一切
More than anything

104
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:30,095
雀斑女  你在吗?
Hey,Freckles,you home?

105
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:33,009
你不是被禁止叫绰号了吗?
Thought you weren't allowed to use nicknames

106
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:44,010
我赌的时候你不在场所以你不算
well,You weren't around when I lost the bet...so you are

107
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:49,097
怎么了?
What's up?

108
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:51,063
想问你件事
I wanted to ask you something

109
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:55,063
什么事?
yea?

110
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:58,061
我人在这呢!
I'm up here

111
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:03,081
你告诉他了吗?
So did you tell him?

112
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:05,086
我告诉谁什么了?
Did I tell who what?

113
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,059
你知道的
You know

114
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,025
告诉医生啊
Did you tell the doc...

115
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:14,012
我和你的事
about you and me?

116
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:18,045
没有  不过他知道了
No.But he knows

117
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:21,014
他在那些监视器里看到我们了
He saw us on one of their surveillance monitors

118
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:22,037
你不是说那些都坏了吗?
You said the camera was broken

119
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:24,094
他们还有一个
Well,they had another camera

120
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:26,072
真是群变态
Perverts

121
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:30,022
不管怎样他知道了
Anyway,he knows

122
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:34,063
既然大家都知道了
Well,now that...that's outta the way...

123
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:38,090
不如来点午后乐事?
How about a little afternoon delight?

124
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,099
我是说做爱
That means sex

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,095
等等  雀斑女
Come on,Freckles,wait. Now...

126
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:46,044
要我给你做集锦磁带吗?
Do you need me to make you a mix tape?

127
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:50,010
好啊  为什么不呢!
Yeah,why don't you do that?

128
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,033
你再告诉我一遍  伙计
Dude,you're gonna have to tell me again

129
00:09:58,034 --> 00:09:59,084
我们需要Jin干嘛?
What do we need Jin for?

130
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:02,038
因为那时他和我们在一起
Because he was there with us

131
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,065
在海滩上  我发现电缆的时候?
On the beach,when I find the cable?

132
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:08,030
在这里...
This way. Here it is

133
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,024
是的
That's right

134
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,042
那些都在你的拼图里?
In one of your puzzle flashes?

135
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:16,028
没错
Aye

136
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:23,029
如果他不来的话  那个人也不会来了?
So... If he doesn't come then neither does the someone you won't tell me anything about

137
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,019
应该是这样
That will be the long or short of it

138
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,084
真不知道怎么才能说服他
but I've no bloody idea how I'm gonna get him to come with us

139
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:36,087
看我的
Watch the master

140
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,090
- 野营?  - 没错
-Camping?  -Yeah

141
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:49,068
海滩上的篝火  嚼着棉花糖  躺着看星星
you know,like,sleeping under the stars,fire on the beach,marshmallows

142
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:53,061
野营
Camping

143
00:10:58,031 --> 00:11:00,019
好啊
yes

144
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,025
人人都爱棉花糖
Everybody likes marshmallows

145
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:05,091
好极了  带上水和吃的
Good man. Get food,water

146
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,015
你去哪里?
Where are you going?

147
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:10,052
我们还需要一个人
We need one more

148
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:13,061
你以为我是白痴吗?
How daft do you think I am?

149
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:17,015
这才不是去野营
This isn't a camping trip

150
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:21,013
你又看到什么了是吗?
You've had another one of your visions,haven't you?

151
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,097
这次是什么?
What was it this time?

152
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:27,078
有人要来这座岛
Someone's coming to the island

153
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,096
到这里来?
Coming?

154
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:30,091
有新人要到这里?
As is someone who's not already here?

155
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:34,033
到底怎么回事?
How the hell is that gonna happen?

156
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:38,011
我不能告诉你
I can't tell you

157
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:40,019
难道和我没关系吗?
It's got nothing to do with me?

158
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,046
和Jin  Hurley一样你也和我们在一起
Well,you're a part of it,yeah,as are Jin and Hurley

159
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:49,085
不过你之前并没告诉Jin和Hurley他们会死
Right,but with all due respect you haven't previously told Jin or Hurley

160
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:55,059
他们不会死的至少这次不会
that they're gonna die. Well,that's not gonna happen,not this time

161
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,074
我能带上吉他吗?
Can I bring my guitar?

162
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:08,015
当然
Absolutely

163
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:11,002
好吧  算我一个
All right,I'm in

164
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:14,069
我刚才还有点担心
You had me worried there for a second

165
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:47,030
就是这里
This is it

166
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,046
你怎么知道?
Well,how can you tell?

167
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:52,065
我就在这里顺着电缆走进丛林的
'Cause that's exactly where I followed the wire into the jungle

168
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:56,008
那它在哪里?
Where is it,then?

169
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:01,076
干得好  伙计
Way to go,dude

170
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:09,015
在这里
Here it is !

171
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:10,056
信号灯就落在这边的斜坡上
The beacon fell this side of the rise

172
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,085
不过那次我顺着这根缆线走进丛林时
Just one thing,last time I followed this wire into the jungle

173
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:19,032
差点被Rousseau的机关串成烤肉串
I almost got kebabbed by one of Rousseau's spiky death trap things

174
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,080
把她弄下来
Cut her down

175
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:24,009
我们现在不进丛林  还不是时候
We're not going in the jungle!Well,not yet

176
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,006
已经很晚了  今晚就在这里扎营吧
It's getting late,so,we'll camp here tonight

177
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:32,042
野营
Camp

178
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:39,061
他们什么时候来?  你的那个神秘人物
So when do they get here...your mysterious someone?

179
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:43,088
快了
Soon

180
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:54,052
你现在可以自由的说话了  Desmond修士
You do realize you are free to talk again,brother Desmond?

181
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:59,096
大概沉默无语的时间太久了吧
Used to being quiet,I suppose

182
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:02,015
Moriah葡萄园

183
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:09,082
修士们给这里的葡萄酒取名真有意思
I find the name the brothers have chosen for the wine made here...interesting

184
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,026
为什么?
And why is that,brother?

185
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:16,021
Moriah是座山的名字  是Abraham杀死Isaac的地方
Well,Moriah is the mountain where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac

186
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:20,008
不是个好地方吧?
It's not exactly the most...festive locale,is it?

187
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,089
但上帝宽恕了Isaac
And yet God spared Isaac

188
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,044
可能有人会说上帝用不着让Abraham
Well,one might argue that...God need not have asked Abraham

189
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:30,004
牺牲自己的儿子了
to sacrifice his son in the first place

190
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:33,090
那就不是考验了  是吗?
Well,then it wouldn't have been much of a test,would it,brother?

191
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:38,022
也许你低估了牺牲的价值
Perhaps you underestimate the value of sacrifice

192
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:40,057
Desmond修士  Desmond修士
Brother Desmond!

193
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:44,098
我在门口碰到这个人 他有话要和你说
I met this man waiting at the gates
He says he needs to have a word with you

194
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:54,055
很抱歉
Sorry,sir

195
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:04,079
请宽恕我  修士
Forgive me,brother

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,088
麦片真美味
The oatmeal's awesome

197
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,091
是啊
It is,huh?

198
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:31,094
很奇怪不是吗?
It's strange,huh?

199
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,016
怎么了?
What's that?

200
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:38,046
回到了这里  不再想方设法逃出笼子
Being back,not...looking for a way out of a cage

201
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:43,039
不再因为一些事而冲进森林 
not finding a reason to go running off into the jungle again

202
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,006
真不知道该怎么做
I almost don't know what to do with myself

203
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:47,090
享受这些吧
Well,enjoy it

204
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:51,024
我敢肯定马上又会出事的
I'm sure something will go wrong soon enough

205
00:15:53,096 --> 00:16:02,079
今晚我的冒险就是要去海里洗盘子
Well,my big,dangerous adventure for tonight
is gonna be doing the dishes in the ocean

206
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,046
- 小心点  - 我尽力吧
-Well,be careful  -I'll try

207
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:13,053
- 借我用下勺子好吗?  - 没问题
-Can I borrow that spoon?  -Yeah.

208
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:22,012
谢谢
Thanks

209
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:33,035
- 晚安  - 晚安
-Good night.  -Yeah,good night

210
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:04,062
你不敲门吗?
What,my doorbell busted again?

211
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:07,030
你要干吗?
What the hell are you doing?

212
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:11,041
闭嘴
Shut up and don't talk

213
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,003
- 你哭了?  - 我说闭嘴!
-You crying?  -I said shut up!

214
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,063
好吧
You got it

215
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:25,063
我喜欢说小鸟的那段  伙计
Dude,I love the part about the bird

216
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:27,018
是只小鸟吧?
It was a bird,right?

217
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:28,046
- 到你了  - 我?
-You.  -Me?

218
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:34,071
你听说过那个夜海怪兽吗?
Have you heard the one about the chupacabra?

219
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,061
怪兽?
Chupa?

220
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:39,050
像一只长刺的熊  但墨西哥人...
Yeah,it's like a bear with spines but Mexican...

221
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,097
谢谢
Thanks

222
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:46,095
那是谁?
Who's that?

223
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:54,080
她叫Penny
Her name's Penny

224
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:57,070
真漂亮
That's not bad,Des,not bad at all

225
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:03,083
你怎么会离开她到这里来的?
So how did you manage to leave her behind and come here?

226
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,030
因为我是个懦夫
Because I'm a coward

227
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:09,099
抱歉
Sorry

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,077
你和我都一样  老兄
You and me both,pal

229
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:18,092
我想逃避她  但她却一直在找我
You know,I tried to run away from her,and she...She tracked me down

230
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,070
她说只要有钱和决心  她能找到任何人
"With enough money and determination you can find anyone," she said

231
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:34,022
我整夜想着她说过的话  也许她真的不会放弃
You know,I used to get through my nights thinking that she actually meant it,that she never gave up...

232
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:38,072
也许这3年来她一直在...
that maybe she spent the last three years...

233
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:43,046
寻找我
looking for me

234
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,053
那是什么?
What's that?

235
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:04,072
是直升机吗?
Is that a helicopter?

236
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:08,015
救援队
Rescue

237
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:19,021
那是直升机的声音吗?
Is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound?

238
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:23,091
不是
No!

239
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,064
- 我们得去那里  - 去那里?
-We gotta go out there.  -Out there?

240
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:45,082
- 是啊  - 为什么要去?
-Well,yeah.  -In what?

241
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:49,026
我们得做些什么
Well,we gotta do something

242
00:20:49,027 --> 00:20:55,099
快看!  看啊!
Look.Look!

243
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:10,040
我的天啊!
My god

244
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,013
不  伙计  那不是空投食品
No dude,it's not a food drop

245
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,062
你也看见那个信号灯了
You saw the beacon thing

246
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:19,097
好像有人被弹出来了
Someone,like,ejected

247
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:21,041
可那是架直升机啊!
Yeah,but that was a helicopter

248
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:24,002
怎么会从直升机里弹出来?
You can't eject from a helicopter

249
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:25,021
也许是跳下来的
Well,maybe they jumped

250
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,094
关键是他们已经着陆了
All that matters is that they're here

251
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:29,035
他们?  也许根本就不是人
"They"?How do we even know it's a person?

252
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:32,045
因为他说"有人"要来这里
Because he said "someone" was coming

253
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:35,059
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

254
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,016
去他们的着陆点
Out to where it fell

255
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:38,009
快  我们走
 Come on. Let's go

256
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,044
不  慢点
No,slow down

257
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,065
我们可不能半夜里到丛林里去
We're not gonna trudge out into the jungle in the middle of the night

258
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:44,010
我们必须得去
Yes,we are

259
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:48,000
Hurley提到Rousseau的陷阱时你没有听到吗?
Were you even listening to Hurley when he mentioned Rousseau's death trap?

260
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:49,083
再过2小时就天亮了
Now it's gonna be light in two hours

261
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:52,085
- 我们可以等到...  - 她不能等
-We'll wait until...  -She can't wait

262
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:53,087
她?
She?

263
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:54,074
他们
They

264
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:56,016
不管是谁...
Whoever it is...

265
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,066
可能已经受伤了
could be hurt

266
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,029
我们4个现在就得出发
We have to go all four of us now

267
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,076
为什么?
Why?

268
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:05,032
因为这都是本该发生的
Because that's the way it's supposed to happen

269
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:11,004
是吗?  看来真的要发生了但我还是不会走的
Right. Well,I guess it's supposed to happen without me

270
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:16,007
超人
Superman...

271
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:31,078
那么天一亮就出发...
We'll leave at first light,then...

272
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,048
我们一起
together

273
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:38,079
好极了
Terrific

274
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:48,065
你妹妹在家吗?
Is your sister in?

275
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:52,002
马上
Leave.

276
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,033
离开
Now

277
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,051
让他进来  Derek
Let him be,Derek

278
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:04,088
你好  Ruth
Hello,Ruth

279
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,099
你现在是个修士了?
So you're a monk now,aren't you?

280
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,024
准确的说我还是个初学者  但是院长说...
Well,technicallyI'm still what they call a novice till the abbott says...

281
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,097
你来这里干嘛Desmond?
Why are you here,Desmond?

282
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:21,076
既然你问起...
Well,now that my initiation is done...

283
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:25,053
我觉得我还歉你一个解释
I felt like I owed you an explanation

284
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:27,075
Desmond
Desmond

285
00:23:27,076 --> 00:23:32,028
你这样做已经来不及了
You can never begin to explain what you did

286
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,048
你在婚礼前1周离开了我
You left one week before the wedding

287
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:37,046
婚礼都安排好了
Everything was planned,bought and paid for

288
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:40,030
你却突然消失了
You just disappeared completely

289
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:42,028
我收到了召唤
I had a calling

290
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,090
我们恋爱了6年
We dated for six years

291
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:49,017
那期间你最接近宗教那次 还是因为凯尔特人队赢了冠军杯!
and the closest you ever came to a religious experience was Celtic winning the cup

292
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:53,011
是的  我对婚礼的事感到了恐慌
Yes,I was scared about the wedding

293
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:56,007
也许当时我喝多了
so I had a few pints,too many,maybe,I had

294
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:00,050
我抬起头
I raised my eyes

295
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:05,090
问自己"我在做正确的事吗?"
and asked,"am I doing the right thing?"

296
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:08,014
这是我记得的最后一件事
And that's the last thing I remember

297
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:09,055
当我醒来时
And when I woke up

298
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:12,019
发现自己躺在马路上
I was lying on my back in the street

299
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,086
我不知道怎么会在那里
and I don't know how I got there

300
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:18,055
有个人站在我身前
And there was this man standing over me

301
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:25,071
他伸出手问我"我能帮你吗  老兄?"
and he reached out his hand and he said to me"can I help you,brother?"

302
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:28,091
我第一眼就注意到他腰间系着的绳子
And the first thing I noticed was...the rope tied around his waist

303
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:32,034
我看着他  然后...
and I looked at him and...

304
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:33,010
我明白了...
I knew...I knew

305
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:38,009
我注定要随他而去
I was supposed to go with him

306
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,095
我注定要抛下...
I was supposed to leave...

307
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,083
所有我关心的事
everything that mattered behind

308
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:47,081
为了这次伟大的召唤
Sacrifice all of it...

309
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:50,085
我要牺牲一切
for a greater calling

310
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:57,048
幸好不是该死的牧羊人召唤了你
Well,it's a good thing a bloody shepherd didn't help you up

311
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:01,042
否则你就要和羊一起生活了?
or I suppose you'd be off with the sheep,wouldn't you?

312
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:07,012
下次和别人分手的时候  Des
Next time you want to break up with someone,Des

313
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:09,080
别去什么修道院
don't join a monastery

314
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:14,097
只需要告诉她  你该死的害怕了
Just tell the girl you're too bloody scared

315
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:25,017
你到底是医生还是木匠?
You a doctor or a carpenter?

316
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:28,020
你父亲从没教过你怎么用锤子?
What,your dad never taught you to use a hammer?

317
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:30,076
没有  可我爸倒是教会了我喝酒
No,my dad taught me how to drink

318
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:33,019
至少那也算个本领
Well,at least it's something

319
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,017
没打扰你们吧?
Hope I'm not interrupting

320
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:41,040
你们在争论谁是最佳另一半吧?
You two arguing over who's your favorite other?

321
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,093
你想干吗  Sawyer?
What do you want,Sawyer?

322
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:44,028
我想...医生
Oh,what I wanted,doc

323
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:49,006
自从你离开以来事态有些变化
was to inform you there's been some developments
since you were A.W.O.L

324
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,065
告诉我
So tell me...

325
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,011
你的反手怎么样?
how's your backhand?

326
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:01,008
哪来的桌子?
Where'd you get the table?

327
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,065
你没认出来吗?
Don't you recognize it?

328
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:06,009
舱口爆炸时弹出来的啊
It fell out of the purple haze when the hatch went blammo

329
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,058
如果我们每隔108分钟不玩一次
If we don't play every 108 minutes

330
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:11,066
这座岛会爆炸的
the island's gonna explode

331
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:16,018
你也有弱项啊!
Finally,something I can beat you at

332
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:21,011
要知道我从12岁起就没再打过
You know,considering I haven't played since I was 12

333
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,080
这没什么可骄傲的
I wouldn't be too proud

334
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,083
多少?  18分?
What is that,18 point?

335
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,086
是啊
yeah.

336
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,055
很奇怪不是吗?
It's kinda strange,huh

337
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:33,012
回到这里
being back?

338
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,098
很好笑吗?
Something funny?

339
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:39,070
Kate昨晚在厨房说了同样的话
Kate said the same thing in the kitchen last night

340
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:41,038
是吗?
She did?

341
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,044
是啊
She did

342
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:47,086
19分
19 point

343
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,068
你们一起吃饭的吗?
So you guys ate together,huh?

344
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:56,095
不  昨晚我和Juliet在一起
No,Juliet and I had dinner together last night

345
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:09,089
三局两胜?
Best two out of three?

346
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,010
好啊
You got it

347
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:16,087
接下来呢?
So what's next?

348
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:18,018
接下来?
Next?

349
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:22,017
是啊  你看到了电缆  从天而降的那个信号
Yeah,you saw the wire,the flashy thing falling out of the sky

350
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:23,028
接下来呢?
Now what?

351
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:25,037
- 也许我能帮你...  - 够了
-Maybe I can help you find...  -That's it

352
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:27,036
接下来就这样了
There is no next

353
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:29,014
我们要找的就是那信号灯
We find the beacon

354
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,059
你为什么要骗我  伙计?
Why are you lying to me,mate?

355
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,010
伙计  到现在为止我已经救了你3次
Look,mate,I've saved your life three times now

356
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:38,056
如果你还不信任我的话那我就没辙了
If that hasn't bought me your trust,I don't know what will

357
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:41,049
快走吧
Let's move

358
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:51,073
伙计
Dude...

359
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:53,077
我都快发心脏病了
seriously,I'm gonna have a coronary

360
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:56,004
你没有  如果你再不走的话
Actually,you're not,and if you don't get a move on

361
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:58,073
我们黄昏之前就到不了那里
we're not gonna make it before nightfall...

362
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:01,036
看看这个
Look at this!

363
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:04,093
肯定不是Rousseau的
It can't be Rousseau's

364
00:28:04,094 --> 00:28:08,078
否则我早就被石头砸死了
If it was Rousseau's,a massive rock would be flying at my head right now

365
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:11,028
别动
Don't move

366
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:13,052
- 你干吗?  - 别动
-What are you doing?.  -Don't move

367
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,003
这些是和那东西一起掉下来的吗?
Did that come down with the flashing red light thingy?

368
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:30,025
对讲机
Walkie-talkie

369
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:35,094
不  那是卫星电话
No,dude,that's a satellite phone

370
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:40,040
糟了  没电了
Crap,it's dead

371
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,065
这很正常
Shocker

372
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:51,014
我的天啊
My God

373
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:53,035
那是你吗?
Is that you?

374
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,074
那她又是谁?
Then who's she?

375
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,041
她叫Penny
That would be Penny

376
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:20,092
这是什么?
What's this?

377
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:23,017
你的集锦磁带
Your mix tape

378
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:30,000
你到底要不要啊?
Well,you gonna take it,or ain't you?

379
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:32,084
"Phil Collins精选集?"
"The best of Phil Collins," huh?

380
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:34,083
别挑三捡四的了
Don't get picky

381
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:37,059
如果Bernard问起来  就说我什么也不知道
And if Bernard asks,I don't know a thing about it

382
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,089
谢谢你  James
Thanks,James

383
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:43,079
昨晚你为什么要那么做?
So why'd you jump me last night?

384
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:45,040
什么?
What?

385
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:49,028
是因为你看到医生和Juliet在一起吗?
Was it 'cause you saw the doc hanging out with Juliet?

386
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:52,025
不是那样的
It was not like that

387
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:54,032
不是吗?
It's not?

388
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,020
想要利用我吗?  雀斑女
You ain't gotta use me,Freckles

389
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:01,012
到时你开口就行了
All you have to do is ask

390
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:14,027
你认为是她  是吗?
You think it's her,don't you?

391
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,071
谁?
Who?

392
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:20,023
你女朋友  Penny
Your girl... Penny

393
00:30:20,024 --> 00:30:24,004
你认为那直升机里的人就是她
You think it's actually her who bailed out of the helicopter

394
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,079
本来我希望是这样
Earlier I hoped it

395
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:29,031
现在我知道是这样
Now I know it

396
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:33,087
你为什么不早点告诉我们?
Why didn't you tell us?

397
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:36,006
我说了你还会来吗?
Would you come if I had?

398
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:37,034
当然会
Of course

399
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,050
为什么不来呢?
Why wouldn't I?

400
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:42,058
我不告诉你们是因为...
I didn't wanna tell you because...

401
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,090
我不想改变什么
I didn't want anything to change

402
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:48,013
也对
Fair enough

403
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:50,090
如果你的预感能让我们得救
Look,if whatever you're seeing leads to your girl getting us rescued

404
00:30:50,091 --> 00:30:53,020
我们干嘛要去改变呢?
why would we want to change anything?

405
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:55,018
是吗?
Right?

406
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:58,003
是啊
Right

407
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:07,045
是啊
Right

408
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:16,010
多谢提醒我们带雨伞  伙计
Thanks for the heads-up about bringing an umbrella,dude

409
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:30,012
It's a grand old team to play for

410
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:37,024
and it's a grand old team to see

411
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:41,039
and if you know your history

412
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,063
Desmond修士?
Brother Desmond?

413
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:45,059
你在干吗?
What are you doing?

414
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:51,036
看来我是被这美酒醉倒了
Well,I believe I'm...getting pissed on our lovely wine

415
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:56,000
这瓶酒可值100多镑
That bottle of our lovely wine fetches over 100 quid

416
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,079
我们今年只装了108箱
We've only bottled 108 cases this year

417
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,064
我们在做贫穷宣言吧? 
It's just as well we've taken a vow of poverty then,isn't it?

418
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:07,041
我们也做了慈善宣言
We've also taken a vow of charity

419
00:32:08,057 --> 00:32:10,054
是啊
Right

420
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:23,091
我有种感觉Desmond你不适合当一个修道士
Something tells me,Desmond,that you're not cut out to be a monk

421
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:28,027
你要知道我这一周过的很不顺利
Well,you know,I've had a tough week

422
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:36,042
对于这酒我很抱歉
I'm sorry for the wine

423
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:39,046
我会忏悔的
I'll take the penance

424
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:43,014
对你来说忏悔还远远不够  Desmond
I'm afraid you're beyond penance,Desmond

425
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,006
Desmond修士
Brother Desmond

426
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:48,088
不再是了
Not anymore

427
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:53,024
你要赶我走?
Are you firing me?

428
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:55,056
是这样的
I am indeed

429
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:58,051
你不能这么做
You can't do that

430
00:32:58,052 --> 00:32:59,046
我听见了召唤
I heard the call

431
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:01,016
这一点我很确定
I'm sure you did hear the cal

432
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:04,068
但这座修道院不是你落脚的地方
but the abbey clearly isn't where you are meant to end up

433
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:10,007
上帝对你的安排不止是做个修道士  Desmond  他对你有更大的安排
I have little doubt that God has different plans than you being a monk,Desmond...bigger plans

434
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:11,010
当然是这样
Aye,sure he does

435
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:13,043
的确是这样
He does

436
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:19,066
一直以来你都不知道自己该去哪里
You've just spent too much time running away to realizewhat you may be running toward

437
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,038
那我现在该怎么办?
What am I supposed to do now?

438
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,073
听天由命吧
Whatever comes next

439
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:58,081
Penny是谁?
Who's Penny?

440
00:33:58,082 --> 00:34:01,028
她是Desmond以前的女朋友
She's a chick Desmond used to date

441
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:03,050
他现在认为她从天上掉了下来
and now he thinks she fell from the sky

442
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:08,002
所以我们要去救她然后她就能帮助我们得救
So we're gonna go save her life,and she's gonna get us rescued

443
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,073
伙计  就算我会说韩语  你也不会明白的
Dude,even if I spoke korean,it wouldn't make any sense

444
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:18,054
少废话  我们快走
We'll move faster if we stop talking

445
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:20,027
她可能受伤了
She might be hurt

446
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:22,028
我们已经尽全力了
I'm moving as fast as I can

447
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:25,027
伙计  我可不是闪电侠
In case you haven't noticed,dude.I'm not exactly the Flash

448
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:27,090
闪电侠太没用了
The Flash is pathetic

449
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:31,017
你对史上最快的人有意见吗?
You got something against the fastest man alive?

450
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:32,076
你疯了  伙计!
You're insane,mate!

451
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:36,020
超人能瞬间环绕地球
Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye

452
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:40,000
伙计  如果是赛跑的话超人是远远比不上闪电侠的
Dude,if we're going by a pure foot race Supes would get dusted by the Flash

453
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:44,039
为什么超级英雄会参加赛跑呢?
But why would the man of steel agree to a sodding foot race?

454
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,088
估计是为了慈善?
Uh,for charity?

455
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:49,003
闪电侠一定能取胜他能震动大地并躲过一切障碍物
The Flash would totally win,'cause he can,like vibrate through walls and stuff

456
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,065
震动啊!
Vibration!

457
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:52,099
如果超人面前有一面墙他会怎么做呢?
And what would Superman do if he came up against a wall?

458
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,091
他不能打碎它
Well,no smashing allowed

459
00:34:57,008 --> 00:34:59,041
不能飞  不能使用那些超能力
No flying,no smashing

460
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:03,001
那个比赛还有其他限制吗?
Any other restrictions I need to know about?

461
00:35:03,082 --> 00:35:08,096
也许我们该给超人配个氪星石...
Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of kryptonite ballet slippers...

462
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,072
什么鬼东西?
The hell?

463
00:35:12,092 --> 00:35:15,053
Charlie快躲开!
Charlie,duck!

464
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:28,081
伙计
Dude

465
00:35:39,062 --> 00:35:41,079
这边走
This way

466
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:44,055
不  那信号落在山的那边
No,the beacon fell this side of the rise

467
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:46,069
不  在那边
No,there

468
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:48,057
我们分头行动吧
How about we split up?

469
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:50,062
我和Charlie去那边  你和Jin走另外一条路
Me and Charlie'll go that way.You and Jin go around

470
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:52,035
我们等会儿在那边山脊上会合
and we'll meet up at that ridge over there

471
00:35:52,036 --> 00:35:55,030
你和Jin吧
You and Jin

472
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:57,034
我和Desmond走
I'll stick with Desmond

473
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:09,042
你叫我"快躲开"
You said "duck."

474
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,047
什么?
Sorry?

475
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:13,040
你大喊"快躲开"
You shouted,"duck."

476
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:16,057
你知道的  你原来就知道的
You knew,even before we set off

477
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,082
- 你一直都知道的  不是吗?  - 是啊
-You knew all this time,didn't you?  -Aye

478
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,032
那你为什么什么也不说呢?
Then,why didn't you say anything?

479
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:22,080
如果我告诉你你就不会来了
Because if I told you the truth,you wouldn't have come

480
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:27,005
你需要我一起来  因为我是你预感的一部分
Oh,you need me to come'cause I was part of your vision

481
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:31,072
你以为唯一救回你女朋友的方法就是朝我头上射箭吗?
You thought the only wayyou could get your girl back was if took an arrow in the head

482
00:36:31,078 --> 00:36:33,042
你想要牺牲我
You were gonna sacrifice me

483
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:36,063
如果那个信号不是我原本看到的那样
If the flashes don't happen exactly as I saw them

484
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:39,033
只要有一点变化
the picture changes

485
00:36:40,027 --> 00:36:42,069
我本该让你死的  Charlie
I was supposed to let you die,Charlie

486
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,016
那是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

487
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:47,007
现在已经毫无意义了
It means it's bloody pointless

488
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:50,037
我不断救你  这样又有什么好处呢?
I keep saving your life,and what good has it done?

489
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:52,046
只会不断的再次发生
It's just gonna keep happening again and again

490
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:53,067
也许这样才有意义
Maybe that's the point,yeah?

491
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:55,024
这也许是个考验
Maybe it's a test

492
00:36:55,097 --> 00:36:59,096
就像上帝考验Abraham  不同的是我失败了...
Like God testing Abraham,except I failed...

493
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:02,080
因为我打破了预感
Because I changed what I saw

494
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:21,052
你能听见我吗?
Hey,can you hear me?

495
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:29,045
伙计  她没反应
Dude,she's not moving

496
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:33,098
我很抱歉  Penny
I'm sorry,Penny

497
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:36,064
我很抱歉
I'm sorry

498
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:53,067
我还以为你会不辞而别
I was afraid you'd left without saying good-bye

499
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:56,002
不会的
No

500
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:59,066
我差点想把这也带走了
I nearly took this with me

501
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:07,025
你不急的话  Martin修士几个小时后要进城
If you're not in a hurry,brother Martin's heading into town in a few hours

502
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:09,043
你可以搭他的车走
He can give you a ride

503
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:13,065
但你得做些体力活
That is,if you don't mind doing some heavy lifting

504
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,058
十个箱子都装满了
All ten cases are ready to go

505
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:20,052
Desmond的是最后一箱
Desmond there is just getting the last one

506
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:23,019
谢谢  我父亲已经寄出支票了吧?
Thank you,and my father sent the check in advance?

507
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,068
感谢他的慷慨解囊
And please thank him for his generous donation

508
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,066
很高兴见到你
Always a pleasure to see you

509
00:38:30,082 --> 00:38:33,017
再见了  Desmond
Good-bye,Desmond

510
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,076
我想全部都装到后车厢里
I think we should be able to fit it all in the back

511
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:44,090
如果装不下就放在前面吧
and if not,we'll put the rest in the front

512
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:48,094
可以吗?
Is that all right?

513
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:52,042
当然
Absolutely

514
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:06,018
你最好小心点开车 小姐
You'd better drive safe,miss

515
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:10,002
这些酒都是很精贵的
This vineyard only makes a limited number of these cases each year

516
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:11,019
是吗?
Is that so?

517
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,007
是啊
Aye

518
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:14,041
因为修道士都很懒
It's because the monks are lazy

519
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:17,073
要知道葡萄果冻比葡萄酒好做多了
You know,it's easier making grape jelly than wine

520
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,003
你怎么这么了解这里的修道士?
And how do you know so much about monks?

521
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:21,031
我曾经是个修士
I'm an ex-monk

522
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:22,022
是吗?
Really?

523
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:24,061
昨天是最后一天
As of last night

524
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:27,033
我被除名了
I was fired

525
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,044
这可不好笑
Well,it wasn't that funny

526
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,013
抱歉  我只是不知道...
I'm sorry. I've never... I've...

527
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:34,007
修道士也可以除名的
I didn't know monks could be fired

528
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:35,070
当然可以
Oh,they can

529
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:39,005
他们用自己的话告诉我
You know,I was told in no uncertain terms

530
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:43,064
这座修道院不是我的落脚点  只是...
that the abbey wasn't where I was meant to end up.just a...

531
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:45,020
一个中转站
step along the path

532
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:49,002
上帝对我有更大的安排
You know,God allegedly has bigger plans for me

533
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,082
我觉得你不怎么相信这一套东西
Something tells me you don't entirely believe that

534
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,073
是啊  所以我很怀疑
I suspect that's because I don't

535
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:59,016
他们也许是对的
Well,maybe they're right

536
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:01,044
如果你不被除名  我们就不会相遇
Well,just think,if you hadn't gotten fired,we wouldn't have met

537
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:07,013
那我怎么可能到Carlisle  自己搬这些箱子呢?
and then...how could you possibly help me unload these crates in Carlisle?

538
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:10,032
我有说过要陪你去Carlisle吗?
Did I say I was coming to Carlisle with you?

539
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,084
目前还没有
Not yet

540
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:25,008
如果一个前修士已经有某个安排了.... 
I mean,of course,if an ex-monk already has plans...

541
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:27,070
要知道我一般不搭陌生人的车 
You know,I don't usually get into cars with strangers

542
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:30,061
那样的话  我叫Penelope
Well,in that case,I'm Penelope

543
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:34,086
Penny
Penny

544
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:37,080
Desmond
Desmond

545
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,092
很高兴见到你  Penny
Very nice to meet you,Penny

546
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:53,067
她还活着!
She's alive

547
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,091
退后!
Stand back!

548
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:59,022
都闪开!
Get away from her!

549
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:01,062
我在这里
I'm here

550
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:03,009
我在这里  Penny
I'm here,Penny

551
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:05,037
让开  Charlie
Just get off,Charlie

552
00:41:05,038 --> 00:41:06,059
我很抱歉  Penny
Sorry,Penny

553
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,050
我很抱歉
Sorry

554
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:17,078
Desmond?
Desmond?

555
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:35,030
