是的  我能听到

4
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:09,063
-你在船上吗?      -什么船?
Hey, are you on a boat? what--what boat?

5
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:11,067
-你的船  -我不在船上
Your boat. I'm not on a boat.

6
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:14,027
Naomi  那个跳伞的
Uh, na-Naomi, the parachutist.

7
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:15,094
谁又是Naomi?
Who? who's Naomi?

8
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:18,045
有反应了!
I've got it. I've got a signal! it's gonna work.

9
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:20,061
一定能行的  我们终于要离开这座岛了
It's happening. we're gonna get off of this island.

10
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:27,051
Desmond在吗?
Is Desmond there?

11
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:29,079
Penny!
Penny!

12
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,009
不!
No!

13
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:37,059
打通那个电话将是末日的开始
Making that call is the beginning of the end.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,028
-你是谁?  -你又是谁?
Who is this? who is this?

15
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:45,017
我是815航班的幸存者之一
I'm one of the survivors of oceanic flight 815.

16
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,087
你能确定我们的方位吗?
Can you get a fix on our location?

17
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:51,085
稍等  我们马上赶到

20
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:23,044
这场高速追击...
It's almost 30 minutes now

21
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,095
已经持续了大约半小时
Since the start of this high-speed chase.

22
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,077
目前我们仍无法确认...
We still have no information

23
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:29,083
驾车者身份
About who's driving this vehicle.

24
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,067
Jeff  请问追击是从哪里开始的?
Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started?

25
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:34,097
Ruth  据称追击是从...
Ruth, we're hearing reports that the pursuit began

26
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:36,037
拉布雷亚附近开始的
Near the La Brea Area,

27
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:38,038
之后穿过10号高速路...
Then traveled through a warehousing district

28
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,013
-以南的一个仓库区  -能看到车上有几人吗?
South of the 10 freeway. can you see how many people are in the car?

29
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,088
看来只有司机一人
It appears to be just the one-- the driver.

30
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:46,089
但不能确定是否是他本人的车
We're not sure if that's the owner of the car.

31
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:48,065
你所看到的这些...
What you're seeing here

32
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,035
是城区以南10号公路附近的画面
Are pictures of the 10 freeway south of downtown.

33
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,023
Jeff  那是一辆卡玛洛吗?
Is that a Camaro, Jeff?

34
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:56,032
对  看起来是辆Vintage  70年初的车型
Yes, it looks like a vintage, early '70s model.

35
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,084
老天
Damn it.

36
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,024
手放在我能看见的地方!
Show us your hands!

37
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:29,035
摇下车窗  把手伸出来!
Roll down the window and show us your hands now!

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,056
左手慢慢打开车门
Now slowly open the door with your left hand.

39
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:50,067
快从车里出来!
Get out of the car!

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,090
慢慢地转过身来!
Turn around... slow!

41
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:09,070
给我趴下!
On the ground!

42
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:12,030
快!
Now!

43
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,032
住手
Stop!

44
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,095
你知道我是谁吗!  放手!
Don't you know who I am?! stop! wait!

45
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:24,044
知道我是谁吗!  我是大洋航班6人之一啊!
Don't you know who I am?! I'm one of the oceanic six!

46
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,089
大洋航班6人之一!
I'm one of the oceanic six!

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,085
所以在10辆警车满城追击你的前5分钟...  
So five mimutes before you let ten cruiser on a chase across the city

48
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:52,022
在5分钟前你却在杂货店里东搞西搞
you're minding your own business In a convenience store,

49
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:56,027
你在杂货店里...直到有东西吓到了你
Until you see something and freak out.

50
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,088
Reyes先生  你为何要逃跑?
Mr. Reyes, why'd you run like that?

51
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,002
你看到了谁?
Who'd you see in there?

52
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:05,086
听着  哥们儿  我知道你在店里看到了某人
Listen, buddy, I know you saw somebody in that store

53
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,066
-是他吓得你落荒而逃跑上高速路  -我没想...
That made you run away and go on a high-speed-- I wasn't running away

54
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,096
逃谁
from anyone.

55
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:12,026
你以为我会在乎你是名人吗
If you think I care that you're a celebrity,

56
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,010
你的卡玛洛误闯进了别人家里
You crashed your Camaro in the wrong neighborhood.

57
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,049
我才不是啥名人
I'm not a celebrity.

58
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:19,033
你不是就凭这个大嚷大叫的吗
Is that why you kept shouting,

59
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:21,007
"我是大洋航班6人之一啊"
"hey, I'm one of the oceanic six"?

60
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,012
想听听有意思的巧合吗
You wanna know a funny coincidence?

61
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,035
行啊
Sure.

62
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:29,089
我认识你航班上的人
I knew somebody on your plane.

63
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,073
真的吗
Really?

64
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,033
她叫Ana Lucia Cortez
Her name was Ana Lucia Cortez.

65
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:39,093
在我晋升探长之前她是我的搭档
She was my partner before I made detective--

66
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,050
黑发...
Dark hair...

67
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:45,028
美极了
Gorgeous.

68
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,066
也许你认识她
Maybe you knew her.

69
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:53,095
也许在飞机上见过她
Maybe you met her on the plane...

70
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:56,011
起飞前见过吗?
Before it took off?

71
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,073
抱歉  我没见过她
Sorry. never met her.

72
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,044
你还是看看录影带吧
Why don't you watch the tape?

73
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,072
也许能给你点启发
Maybe it'll spark something.

74
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,089
我去拿点炸面圈
I'm gonna get a doughnut.

75
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,075
要吃吗
You want one?

76
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,061
不了  谢谢
No, thanks.

77
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:20,094
等我回来  你要告诉我你在躲谁
And when I come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from.

78
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,004
救命
Help!

79
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,052
救命
Help!

80
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:01,009
救命  让我出去!
Help! let me out!

81
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,062
你到底发什么神经!
What the hell is wrong with you?

82
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,052
你在做什么  Reyes
What are you doing, Reyes?

83
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,064
你想进疯人院吗
Huh? you trying to get tossed into the nuthouse?

84
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:09,068
如果那是你想要的话
Because if that's what you want,

85
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:14,005
-伙计 我马上就能把你送进去  -是吗?
I can make that happen right now, my friend. you can?

86

Thank you. thank you.

88
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,096
Jack?  你在那吗  伙计
Jack? you there, dude?

89
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:24,091
海滩呼叫Jack
Beach to Jack.

90
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,084
我在  Hurley  什么事?
Right here, Hurley. what's up?

91
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:32,001
你们是不是已经到无线电塔了?
Hey, uh, did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet?

92
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:34,058
是的  而且我已经和船上的人联系过了
Yeah, and I talked to the people on the boat.

93
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:39,008
-他们正赶来接我们  -真的吗  成功了?
They're on their way to pick us up right now. seriously? it worked?

94
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:42,003
当然  我们这就回海滩
Seriously. we're all on the way back to the beach right now,

95
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,082
所以你开始收拾行李吧  伙计
So you better pack your bags, buddy.

96
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,064
伙计  太棒了
Dude, that's great!

97
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,034
找到他了吗?
Any luck?

98
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:58,097
没有  没有他的踪影
Nothing. no sign of him.

99
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:00,088
他不见了
It's like he just disappeared.

100
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:05,063
-为什么Locke要杀她  他都没见过她  -因为他疯了
Why would Locke kill her? he hadn't even met her-- because he's crazy.

101
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,007
如果他回来了呢?
So what if he comes back?

102
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:10,075
如果他回来  我就宰了他!
If he comes back, I'm gonna kill him.

103
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:18,030
我去把大家都叫上
I'm gonna get everybody together.

104
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:20,054
我们越快回海滩越好
The sooner we get back to the beach, the better.

105
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:25,080
我们真的就快回家了吗?
Are we really going home?

106
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,005
是的  我们要回家了
Yeah, we're really going home.

107
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:41,055
真不敢相信  我会在医院里...
I can't believe I'm actually going to have my baby

108
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:42,089
生下我的孩子
In a hospital.

109
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,002
-得意什么嘛  -我不是那个意思
Oh, rub it in, why don't you? oh, no.

110
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:49,077
-你们需要帮忙吗  -不用了  我们自己收拾
You ladies need a hand? no, we're just wrapping things up, thanks.

111
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,061
你一定为Bernard感到自豪
You know, you must be very proud of Bernard.

112
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:55,024
我听说他是个真英雄
I hear he's quite the hero.

113
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:56,097
这里的所有人都知道
Look, everyone up here knows

114
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,038
真正的英雄是你的男人Claire
That the real hero is your man, claire.

115
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,034
如果不是Charlie关掉了屏蔽信号
If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be

116
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:05,080
我们的信号一定还会被干扰
Getting a busy signal on that fancy phone.

117
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:09,047
所以等他回来了
So you better make sure you treat him real good

118
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,025
你一定要好好伺候他
When we get back.

119
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,076
Rose!
Rose!

120
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:17,072
好的  谢谢  不用了
Okay, thanks. I have enough.

121
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,092
我要你帮我一个忙
I need you to do me a favor.

122
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,034
我要你带着Alex
I need you to take Alex

123
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,042
离开这里  越远越好
And get as far from here as possible.

124
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,028
-什么?  -听我说  没时间争论了
What? listen to me. we don't have time for this.

125
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,071
呆在这里的人都会死
Everyone who stays here is going to die.

126
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:36,009
现在赶快带着Alex离开这里
Now get Alex and get away right now.

127
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,058
我不管你要去哪里  走就行
I don't care where you go. just go.

128
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:40,080
我不会让我的女儿...
I will not have my daughter--

129
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,079
她才不是你的女儿
She's not your daughter.

130
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,006
我告诉过你我中奖的事吗
Did I ever tell you I won the lottery?

131
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:11,007
我身价有一亿五千万多
I got, like, $150 million.

132
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,014
一辈子遇到过的最倒霉的事
Worst thing that ever happened to me.

133
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:15,044
是啊  谁用的着那一亿五千万?
Oh, yeah, who needs $150 million, right?

134
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:19,053
现现在都没有了  他们一定以为我死了
Now it'll all be gone, cause they all think I'm dead.

135
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,028
等我们获救后...
When we get rescued,

136
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,072
当我回家后...
And I go back...

137
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,055
我就自由了
I'm gonna be free.

138
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,090
我想来个"深水炸弹"
I wanna do a cannonball.

139
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,072
每天都在海滩上走来走去
I've been walking up and down this beach every day

140
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:39,038
看着这片海
And looking out at this water,

141
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:41,027
真的想跳下去
And I wanna do a cannonball.

142
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:44,005
Hurley...
Hurley...

143
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:45,084
你想跳"深水炸弹"
You wanna do a cannonball,

144
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,064
你就炸吧
Cannonball.

145
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,059
你还好吗  Desmond?
Are you all right, Desmond?

146
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:36,002
我们得找到Jack
We need to get to Jack.

147
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,058
不能让他联系那艘船
We can't let him get in touch with that boat.

148
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:42,037
-放松老苏一切就绪  船在路上了  -什么?  不行
Easy, Scotty. everything's cool. boat's on the way. what? on the way? no.

149
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:44,077
-Charlie在哪?  -不  那个Naomi  她撒谎了
Hey, where's Charlie? no, that woman--Naomi-- she lied.

150
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,046
-船上的人不是他们所说的  -什么?
Look, the people on the boat aren't who they say they are! what?

151
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,052
-那他们是谁?  -Desmond  Charlie在哪?
Then who are they? Desmond, where's Charlie?

152
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,046
-Desmond...  -我不知道  但是我们得马上找到Jack
Desmond-- I don't know, but we need to get in touch with Jack now!

153
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:53,043
别担心  我们能用对讲机联系到他
It's all right. we can call him. we have a walkie. it's okay. well,

154
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,029
在哪  快拿出来
where is it? get it.

155
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,004
-你说那群人不是他们所说的是什么意思?   -Charlie在哪
What do you mean the people aren't who they say-- where's Charlie?!

156
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,098
抱歉兄弟  我...
I'm--i'm--i'm sorry, brother. i...

157
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:33,034
是我们的船吗
You think that's our ride?

158
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,011
你好?
Hello?

159
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:38,007
Jack  我是George Minkowsk
Hey, Jack. this is George Minkowski.

160
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,098
我们正试着确定你们的方位
We're trying to get a lock on your signal there,

161
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,003
但有些射频干扰
But we're getting some rf interference.

162
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,074
我们需要在你的卫星电话上...
We're gonna need to rejigger some of the settings

163
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:44,094
改下设置
On your sat-phone.

164
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:47,052
好的  告诉我怎么做
Uh, sure. okay. just tell me what I gotta do.

165
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:49,039
你让Naomi接吧？
How about you put Naomi on?

166
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:53,029
Naomi去找柴火了
Naomi went to get some firewood.

167
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,087
你先等一下  我看下能否...
Can you hold on for a second? let me see if I can...

168
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:11,065
她人呢?
Where is she?

169
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,084
我不知道
I don't know.

170
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:23,006
我们要叫医生
Look, we gotta call the doc.

171
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:26,024
你听见Desmond说的了吗?  Charlie在他的手上写着...
Did you listen to Desmond? Charlie wrote on his hand--

172
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,097
我很遗憾他死了  但我甚至不知道
Look, I'm sorry he's dead, but I don't even know

173
00:12:28,098 --> 00:12:32,051
-"不是Penny的船"什么意思  -找Jack也无济于事
What the hell "not Penny's boat" means. calling Jack accomplishes nothing.

174
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,094
至少能警告他
It would accomplish warning him.

175
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:35,058
也让货船上的人认识到我们...
it also means warning the people on the freighter

176
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:38,000
对他们的怀疑  我很确信..
That we're suspicious of them. I have no doubt they're

177
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,053
-在监控我们的联系  如果我们打电话给Jack  -你知道吗？
Monitoring our communications. if we call Jack-- you know what?

178
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:43,034
对讲机在我手里  我这就打过去
I got the walkie. I'm making the call.

179
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:50,089
我们最好现在就起程
We better get goin'.

180
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:57,001
去哪？！
Going where?!

181
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:06,099
我找到了那女孩的血迹  估计已经跑远了
I found blood--the girl's trail. probably crawled away.

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,068
大约快我们10分钟左右
Can't be more than ten minutes ahead of us.

183
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:12,094
-我们现在就要去找她  -把他一起带上
We should go now and find her. we're taking him with us.

184
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,052
为什么？
And why would we do that?

185
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:16,091
我不放心他跟任何人在一起  除了我
Because I don't trust him with anybody but me.

186
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,003
大家听好了
All right, listen up.

187
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:24,061
我要大家回到海滩去
I need all of you to head back down to the beach,

188
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,097
因为等他们到了这里  我们得...
And when these people show up, we wanna make sure

189
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,048
让他们立刻就找到我们
That we're real easy for them to find, okay?

190
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:32,002
你看起来有些担心啊  Jack
You look worried, Jack.

191
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,084
我唯一担心的是...
The only thing I'm worried about

192
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:37,030
错过回家的船
Is missing our ride home.

193
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:45,090
我找到她留下的踪迹了  她朝岛西边去了
I found her trail. she's headed west across the island.

194
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,040
Rousseau已经发现了  我们这就去找她
Rousseau already found it. we're going after her right now.

195
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:54,006
你确定是她的？
What? are you sure it's hers?

196
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:56,027
除非有其他人在流血
Unless someone else is bleeding.

197
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,011
但如果她不想我们找到她
Okay, but if she didn't want us to find her,

198
00:13:58,062 --> 00:14:00,039
那她有可能留下假踪迹
Then she could've created a dummy trail.

199
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,074
-我觉得我们该分头行动  -Kate  现在起6小时后
I think we should follow both just in c-- Kate, six hours from now,

200
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,015
我们会坐在船上
We're gonna be sitting

201
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:07,045
嘲笑咱们这最后一件...
Laughing about the fact that there was one final thing

202
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,036
有分歧的事
That we couldn't agree upon.

203
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:12,030
Naomi受伤了  她跑进了丛林
Naomi is hurt. she ran into the jungle.

204
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,040
她不会花心思留下假痕迹
She's not thinking about leaving fake trails.

205
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,099
你是对的
You're right.

206
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,024
我会顺着痕迹找到她
I'll track her down.

207
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,054
-你何不带大家回到海滩？  -好的
Why don't you get everybody back to the beach? you got it.

208
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,031
小心  好吗？
Be careful, okay?

209
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,091
你怎么了  Hugo?
What the hell's gotten into you, Hugo?

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,011
他们早上都会回来  如果我们等着
They'll all be back in the morning. if we just wait--

211
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:52,088
-你不会不顾警告等着吧...  -警告
You don't wait with warnings. you... warn.

212
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:08,034
还以为能作个好梦
Here I was thinking I was gonna get a good night's sleep.

213
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:20,080
那次你就快赢我了
You almost got me that time.

214
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:23,043
十局七胜怎么样?
How about best out of seven?

215
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,046
准备好吃药了吗  Hugo?
Are you ready for your meds, Hugo?

216
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,086
顺便说一下
Oh, by the way,

217
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:30,040
有人来看你了
You have a visitor.

218
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:42,049
Reyes先生
Mr. Reyes.

219
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:46,057
你好  我叫Matthew Abbadon
Hello. my name is Matthew Abbadon.

220
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,035
我是大洋航空公司的代理人
I'm an attorney for oceanic airlines.

221
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:52,045
我们可以谈谈吗？
Can we talk for a few minutes?

222
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,094
好的
Okay.

223
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,023
我来...  Reyes先生
I'm here, mr. Reyes,

224
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:06,034
因为我们听说了你最近的...插曲
Because we've heard about your recent... episode.

225
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:09,088
你的被捕  你在这儿的监禁
Your arrest, your incarceration here--

226
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:13,055
坦白说  我们很难过
Frankly, we feel terrible about it.

227
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:17,029
因此代表大洋航空公司
So on behalf of oceanic,

228
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,080
我想给你一个邀请
I'd like to extend you an invitation

229
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:20,036
为了一点改善
For a little upgrade.

230
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,096
哪种...改善？
What... kind of upgrade?

231
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,095
去一个更整洁干净的地方
To a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls,

232
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:31,088
有自己的浴室
Where you'd have your own bathroom.

233
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:35,023
-你可以看见大海  -我不想看见大海
You can see the ocean from-- I don't wanna see the ocean.

234
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,054
这没问题
No problem.

235
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,085
确实很感谢
Actually, thanks.

236
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:45,010
我...我在这很好
I'm... I'm fine right here.

237
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:49,077
你好吗  Reyes先生？
Are you fine, mr. Reyes?

238
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,016
什么意思？
What do you mean?

239
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:54,082
你现在精神病院
You're in a mental institution.

240
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:58,018
能再说一遍你的身份吗?
Who'd you say you were again?

241
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:01,095
你有名片吗
I'd like to see a business card.

242
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:08,098
可能忘在家里了
I must have left them at home.

243
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
那我们到此为止了  伙计
Then we're done, dude.

244
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:15,084
他们还活着吗?
Are they still alive?

245
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:20,038
什么?
What?

246
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,089
不要明知故问
You heard me.

247
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,092
护士  护士  赶他走!
Nurse! nurse! get out of here!

248
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:29,006
赶他走  救命  救命
You better get outta here! help me! help me!

249
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,083
-那个人在跟踪我  我没事  救命  -没事了
No, no, no, no. that guy's after me! help me! okay, okay.

250
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,026
没事吧  Hugo?
You all right there, Hugo?

251
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,093
我没事  伙计
Yeah, dude, I'm fine.

252
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,092
想聊聊吗?
You wanna talk about it?

253
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:00,027
聊什么?
Talk about what?

254
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,070
Charlie
Charlie.

255
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:08,023
我觉得...
I mean...

256
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,074
你俩是好兄弟  我想...
You two were buddies. I just thought...

257
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:14,071
不聊天我们才跟得上Jack
We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk.

258
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:24,046
我上去叫带队的走慢点
I'm gonna head up and tell them to slow down a little.

259
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,065
我跟得上
I can keep up.

260
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,018
好吧  
All right, ese.

261
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,070
要帮忙尽管嚷嚷
Just... holler if you need me.

262
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,035
伙计们?
Guys?

263
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:06,025
伙计们
Guys!

264
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:08,090
人呢
Guys!

265
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,008
你们在哪儿
Guys!

266
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:21,085
伙计们
Guys!

267
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:48,089
血迹在这里消失了
The blood trail ends here.

268
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,092
什么意思?
What do you mean?

269
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,092
没有了
It ends.

270
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:55,005
你意思是她到这里就止住血了?
What, are you telling me that she stopped bleeding here?

271
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:57,064
不  她耍了我们  她到这后就按原路返回了
No, I'm telling you that she fooled us and doubled back.

272
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,007
赶紧和船上的人说
Better call the boat,

273
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:03,040
她扎了个好大好大的火把
Tell 'em she's getting a really big bundle of firewood.

274
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,082
电话在哪?
Where is it?

275
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,023
好吧  她偷了你的电话时
Okay, I probably should have told you

276
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:18,021
我本想告诉你  但鉴于你痛打了我一顿  Jack
That I saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, Jack.

277
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,090
-我欠你的  -你在说什么呢? 
I owed you one. what are you talking about?

278
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:25,016
你们拥抱时  Kate趁机偷走了电话
Kate took it when she hugged you.

279
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,017
她追踪的痕迹是对的  可你不听她的
She found the right trail, too, but you wouldn't listen to her,

280
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:31,082
我想她也是自找麻烦
So I guess she's taken matters into her own hands.

281
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,023
不过凡事要往好的方面想
But look on the bright side. at least

282
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,062
至少有人知道该做什么
Somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing.

283
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:17,055
喂?
Hello?

284
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,084
你是谁?
Who's this?

285
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:21,073
我是Kate
Uh, this is Kate.

286
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,000
你和Jack在一起?
You with Jack?

287
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:26,086
-不  他不在这  -Naomi在哪里?
No, no, he's not here. where's Naomi?

288
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:29,086
我们正在找她
Uh, we're looking for her.

289
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,087
什么意思  你们在找她?
What do you mean, you're looking for her?

290
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:46,025
给我电话
Give me the phone.

291
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:49,076
给我电话
Give me the phone.

292
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:52,078
Naomi  你受伤了  让我来帮你
Naomi, listen to me. you're hurt. let me help you.

293
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,002
帮我?  过去的三天
Help me? I just spent the last three days

294
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:58,027
我一直在努力使你们获救
Trying to get you people rescued,

295
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:00,063
可你们却恩将仇报
And you throw this knife in my back.

296
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:02,029
不是我们干的
No, that was not us.

297
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,098
-他叫John Locke  -什么?
His name is John Locke. what?

298
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,036
他说你隐瞒了自己的身份
He said that you weren't who you said you were.

299
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:14,089
我发誓我们不想伤害你  你了解我们的
I swear to god we would never hurt you. you know us.

300
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:17,054
我们需要你的帮助  求你了
Please, we need your help. please help us.

301
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:19,017
把电话给我
Give me the phone.

302
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:27,057
George  我是Naomi
George, it's Naomi.

303
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:29,014
Naomi  你去哪了?
Naomi, where have you been?

304
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,017
发生什么了?
What's going on over there?

305
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:35,027
出了点意外
I had an accident.

306
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,066
我受伤了
I'm hurt.

307
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,089
意外?  什么意外?
What? a-an accident? what--what--what accident?

308
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,024
发生什么了?
What happened?

309
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:43,007
Naomi!
Naomi!

310
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:45,037
喂?
Hello?

311
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:46,085
喂?
Hello?

312
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:49,023
当我跳伞降落时
I hit a tree branch

313
00:22:49,023 --> 00:22:51,057
我被树杈弄伤了
When I parachuted in.

314
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:53,028
树枝穿破了我的肚子
Took it through my gut.

315
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:55,095
他们怎么说你去找柴火了?
Why did they tell me you were getting firewood?

316
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:58,004
我猜他们是不敢告诉你我出事了
I guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me

317
00:22:58,005 --> 00:23:01,003
直到我亲自跟你说吧  我们收不到信号了
Till I could talk to you myself. we've lost our signal,

318
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,072
我们就找不到你
and we can't come get you.

319
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:05,014
你能调下你的追踪频率吗?
Can you change your tracking frequency?

320
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:06,026
好的
Yeah.

321
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,044
现在试试看
Try it now.

322
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,082
很清楚  坚持住  Naomi
Clear as a bell. hang on, Naomi.

323
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,090
我们将尽快带你回来  好吗?
We'll--we'll get you back here asap, okay?

324
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,018
对不起  George
I'm sorry, George.

325
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,024
告诉我妹妹  我爱她
Just tell my sister that I love her.

326
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,059
有人吗?
Hello?

327
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:20,053
救命
Help!

328
00:24:21,054 --> 00:24:22,065
救命
Help!

329
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:24,041
救命
Help!

330
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,049
这儿什么都没有
There's nothing here.

331
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:45,000
这儿什么都没有  这儿什么都没有
There's nothing here. there's nothing here.

332
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,054
这儿什么都没有
There's nothing here.

333
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:01,047
你好  Hugo
Hello, Hugo.

334
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:08,018
你迷路了  Hugo
You got yourself good and lost out here, Hugo.

335
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:12,021
你是怎么跟队伍走散的?
How did you get separated from the group?

336
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,028
我...
I just...

337
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:19,065
我猜被落在后面
Fell behind, I guess.

338
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:22,032
因为这个你就高呼救命?
Is that why you were shouting for help?

339
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:24,004
是的  我吓了一跳
Well, I got scared.

340
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:31,040
Desmond说那个站发生什么...
What Desmond said happened down in that station--

341
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:34,012
不是Penny的船...
"not Penny's boat"...

342
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:38,026
你确信那是Charlie写在手上的吗?
Are you sure that's what Charlie wrote on his hand?

343
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,025
Jack本来不该叫那些人的
Jack should never have called those people.

344
00:25:40,026 --> 00:25:41,078
我再同意不过
I couldn't agree more.

345
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,010
说服他不要...
It's gonna be hard to...

346
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,010
让这些人来...
Talk him into thinking they're not coming here

347
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,017
会很难的
To rescue us.

348
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:52,078
是啊  我们已经尽了最大的努力  Hugo
Well, we're just gonna have to try our best, Hugo,

349
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:54,037
因为如果我们
Because if we

350
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:56,066
不能说服他放弃那个想法...
Can't talk him out of it...

351
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:00,054
Charlie就死得毫无价值
Then Charlie died for nothing.

352
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,007
你到底去哪儿啦  Hugo?
Where the hell you been, Hugo?

353
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:23,039
抱歉  我只是  迷路了
Sorry. I was just, uh, I got lost.

354
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,055
你来这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

355
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:34,022
我来这里的目的跟你一样...警告Jack
I came here for the same reason you did--to warn Jack

356
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:35,087
关于在船上的那些人
About the people on that boat.

357
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:37,084
我已经试过一次了
I already gave it a shot,

358
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:42,010
但我认为一些支持可以增加点儿运气
But I figured I might have better luck with some support.

359
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:43,064
你想得到我的支持?
You want my support?

360
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,086
告诉我你为什么毁了潜水艇
You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine.

361
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:00,052
Jin-Soo Kwon
Jin-Soo Kwon

362
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,082
看我好好的
Still in one piece.

363
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:27,048
兰博
Rambo. ow.

364
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,056
我去跟她说
I'll tell her.

365
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:08,028
他死了
He's dead.

366
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:13,097
Charlie... 死了
Charlie's... dead.

367
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:15,046
不
No.

368
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:42,006
我要是你  我会小心的
I'd watch out if I were you.

369
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:43,099
你说什么呢  伙计?
What are you talking about, dude?

370
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,021
那儿有个人  他一直看着你
There's a guy over there. he's staring at you.

371
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:51,029
-哪个人?  -那个人
What guy? that guy.

372
00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:55,034
嘿  哥们儿
Hey, man.

373
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:57,053
别跑
Don't run.

374
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,049
Hurley
Hurley.

375
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:03,041
你就...
Just...

376
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:05,077
你就... 坐下来
Just... sit down.

377
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:08,032
我想跟你谈谈
I wanna talk to you.

378
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:15,013
别重蹈你在商店的覆辙
Come on. don't do what you did in the store.

379
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:16,044
好吗?
Okay?

380
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:20,053
没必要... 没必要抓狂
There's no need to... freak out.

381
00:29:20,054 --> 00:29:21,053
没必要抓狂?
No need to freak out?

382
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:23,090
我当时只是去买些牛肉干和一杯果汁
I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushee,

383
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:26,031
突然间你就出现在那蛋糕旁边
And suddenly you're standing there over by the ho hos.

384
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:29,058
你死了  你想让我做什么呢?
You're dead. what do you expect me to do?

385
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,013
我们能...坐下吗?
Can we just... sit down?

386
00:29:32,052 --> 00:29:35,005
我可能在精神病院  但我知道你死了
I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead,

387
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:39,009
而且我不会跟你在想象中谈话
And I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you.

388
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:41,001
我是死了
I am dead.

389
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:47,012
但我也在这儿
But I'm also here.

390
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:56,063
好吧  证明一下 
Okay, prove it.

391
00:29:57,052 --> 00:30:00,054
好的  好的
Okay. okay.

392
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,084
你当时知道游过去自己就会死吗?
Did you know you were going to die when you swam out there?

393
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,058
为什么不早告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:26,092
因为你肯定会拦住我
Because you would have tried to stop me.

395
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:28,052
我想自己既然已经下定决心
And since I was gonna do it anyway,

396
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:30,083
还不如就瞒着你算了
I thought I would spare you all the drama.

397
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:36,056
现在你该做些事了
And now you have to do something.

398
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:39,030
但你在逃避
But you're hiding from it.

399
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:42,045
这才是为什么你在商店里看到我
That's the real reason you ran

400
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:44,058
会跑掉的原因
When you saw me in the store.

401
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:46,057
你知道我是来告诉你...
You knew I was here to tell you--

402
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:48,027
不  我不听
No, I'm not listening to this.

403
00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:49,090
不听,因为你根本不在这里
No, cause you're not here.

404
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,015
我在这,你怎么跟小孩子似的
I am here. you're being a baby.

405
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:54,083
等我闭上眼睛数五下
I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five,

406
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:56,081
-然后我睁开眼你肯定就不见了  -我在这呢
And when I open 'em, you'll be gone. I am here.

407
00:30:56,082 --> 00:30:58,047
-1...  -别闹了
One... don't do this.

408
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,089
-2...  -他们需要你
Two... they need you.

409
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,066
-3...  他们需要你  Hugo 
Three... they need you, Hugo.

410
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,054
-4...  -你知道他们需要你
Four! you know they need you.

411
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:04,098
5!
Five!

412
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,037
发生...  发生什么事了?
What... what happened?

413
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:28,040
他...  他是怎么...
I mean, how-- how did he...

414
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:33,015
他是为了帮我们
He was trying to help us.

415
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:10,085
Jack
Jack.

416
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,054
你不会朝我开枪的  Jack
You're not gonna shoot me, Jack...

417
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:21,016
只有我才...
Any more than I was gonna shoot...

418
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:26,016
没装子弹
It's not loaded.

419
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:33,050
别管我!
Let's do it!

420
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:41,060
-你知道他都做了什么  -我知道!
Do you know what he did? yes, I know what he did!

421
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:43,027
我所做的一切...
All I did...

422
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:46,081
我所作过的...
All I have ever done...

423
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:50,009
全是为了我们大家好
Has been in the best interest of all of us.

424
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,060
你疯了吗?
Are you insane?!

425
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:58,042
我知道...说来话长
I know i... I have a lot of explaining to do.

426
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:02,096
但我从来没做过对不起你们的事
But I never did anything to hurt any of you.

427
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:06,021
我甚至豁出性命通知你们有个叛徒混进来了  
I even risked my life to tell you that there was a traitor in your midst.

428
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:07,053
-她帮了我们  John
she helped us, John.

429
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:12,000
你所做的一切都是为了不让我们离开这个岛
All you ever did was blow up every chance we had Of getting off this island.

430
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,090
你杀了Naomi!
You killed Naomi!

431
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:17,066
确切的说  还没杀死她
Well, technically, he didn't kill her yet.

432
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,058
不  她已经死了
Yes, he did.

433
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,010
刚死的
She just died.

434
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:26,001
她没有说出来  John
She didn't give you up, John.

435
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,098
她都是为了我们
She covered for us,

436
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:31,094
还修好了这个  他们在路上了
And she fixed this. they're on their way.

437
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:35,038
她不是为任何人好
She didn't cover for anyone.

438
00:33:35,044 --> 00:33:38,069
她是想让她的人来这里
She wants her people to come here.

439
00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:42,079
相信我,他们来的时候我们最好已经离开了
And trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here.

440
00:33:43,032 --> 00:33:45,010
我要去营地那里 
I'm going to the barracks.

441
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:46,085
那里已经被"其他人"遗弃了
The others abandoned them.

442
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:48,089
那是现在岛上唯一安全的地方
It's the only place on the island with any form

443
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,033
在我想出更好的办法之前我们得去那里
Of security right now. it'll have to do until I can think of something else.

444
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:58,066
要是你们想活命的话  跟我来吧
Until then, if you want to live, you need to come with me.

445
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:01,065
没人会跟你走的  John
No one's going anywhere with you, John,

446
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:04,085
-因为他们不是疯子  -他才不是疯子
Because they're not crazy. he's not crazy.

447
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:07,087
Charlie呢?
What about Charlie?

448
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,065
Charlie游到那个地方是为了救我们
Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued.

449
00:34:20,065 --> 00:34:22,058
而他在那里做的...
And whatever he did down there...

450
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:23,086
也成功了
It worked.

451
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:29,082
但一定是发生了什么
But then something must've happened.

452
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,033
最后时刻他一定听到什么...
He must have heard something before he...

453
00:34:39,006 --> 00:34:40,069
我不知道为什么
I don't know why,

454
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:43,012
但那改变了他的想法
But it changed his mind.

455
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:52,054
因为他所作的最后一件事就是警告我们
Because the last thing he did was to warn us

456
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:55,099
船上的人不是我们所想象的那样
That the people on that boat are not who they said they were.

457
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:12,062
所以我不会听你的
So I'm not listening to you.

458
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:18,075
我听我朋友的
I'm listening to my friend.

459
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:24,039
我听Charlie的
I'm listening to Charlie.

460
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,013
还有谁?
Anyone else?

461
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,087
快没时间了
There isn't much time.

462
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,017
Jack  你允许的话  我想跟John走
Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John.

463
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,040
去吧
He's all yours.

464
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,033
你说过我们离开不了这个岛了
You said we'd never leave the island.

465
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,057
如果...
If you, uh,

466
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:31,099
你想跟Locke走  我跟着你
You wanna go with Locke, I'll be right behind ya.

467
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:34,086
我不会跟那个家伙走的
I'm not going anywhere with that man.

468
00:36:45,012 --> 00:36:46,089
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

469
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,069
干我一直在干的事  Kate...
Same thing I've always done, Kate...

470
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,093
活下去
Survivin'.

471
00:37:18,064 --> 00:37:21,075
如果你改主意了,你知道在哪找我们
You know where to find us when you change your mind.

472
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:08,095
灌篮高手啊!
You ever miss?

473
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:14,050
Jack
Jack.

474
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:18,079
是  我结束了个会诊的活儿...
Yeah. I was, uh, on my way back from a consult.

475
00:38:19,057 --> 00:38:22,032
想顺道过来拜访你一下
Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit.

476
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,045
咱们赌马?(投篮游戏  谁输按horse得字母)
Horse?

477
00:38:25,063 --> 00:38:26,071
放马过来吧
You're on.

478
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:30,079
会诊咯?
So... consult, huh?

479
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,054
那是否意味你回来做外科?
Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff?

480
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:34,056
是
Yeah.

481
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,093
“得了h”（输第一分）
"h."

482
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,087
没有狗仔队缠着你了?
Reporters leaving you alone?

483
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:52,063
虽然在我出去喝咖啡的时候还有些粉丝要签名  
still have to sign some autographs when I go out for coffee,

484
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:57,092
不过...考虑把胡子留起来
but...Thinking about growing a beard.

485
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:01,065
你留胡子会看起来很古怪的  伙计
You'd look weird with a beard, dude.

486
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:04,015
已经h-o了（输两分）
That's h-o.

487
00:39:04,097 --> 00:39:06,001
因此…
So...

488
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:11,004
你到底为什么要来  Jack?
What are you really doing here, Jack?

489
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:17,026
我只是来看看你
I was just checking on you,

490
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:19,078
看一切是否还好
Seeing if everything was okay.

491
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:22,026
你是来看我是否会发疯
You're checking to see if I went nuts,

492
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:24,039
是否我会把真相捅出去
If I was gonna tell.

493
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,073
你会吗?
Are you?

494
00:39:32,062 --> 00:39:34,011
该你投篮了
You're up.

495
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:39,050
算你赢好了  我...
Nah, you win. i, uh...

496
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,022
我得走了
I gotta run.

497
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:48,018
非常高兴见到你  Hurley
It was great seeing you, Hurley.

498
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:55,051
抱歉
I'm sorry.

499
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,064
抱歉我跟Locke一起走了
I'm sorry I went with Locke.

500
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,067
我应该和你呆在一起
I should've stayed with you.

501
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:12,054
往事已矣  伙计
It's water under the bridge, man.

502
00:40:18,074 --> 00:40:20,074
我不认为我们做的对  Jack
I don't think we did the right thing, Jack.

503
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,003
-我认为它要我们回去  -Hurley...
I think it wants us to come back. Hurley...

504
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,072
-该尽一切努力...  -我们绝不回去
And it's gonna do everything it can-- we're never going back.

505
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,012
永远不要说"绝对"  伙计
Never say never, dude.

506
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:05,087
你在想Charlie?
Are you thinking of Charlie?

507
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:10,094
我们一起逃亡那刻感觉就象一百年前的事了
Feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together.

508
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:14,069
怎么会发生这事?
How did this happen?

509
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:26,019
雷声越来越大了
Thunder's getting louder.

510
00:41:31,015 --> 00:41:32,093
那不是雷声
That's not thunder.

511
00:41:33,002 --> 00:41:34,008
快点
Come on.

512
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,087
快点
Come on.

513
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:14,045
你是Jack吗?
Are you Jack?
