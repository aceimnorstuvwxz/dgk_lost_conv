3
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:22,012
法语! 法国人要来了!
French! The French are coming!

4
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,008
我对听到法语还从没这么开心过!
I've never been so happy to hear the French!

5
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:27,047
-谁会说法语?  -她会
-Does anyone speak French?  -She does.

6
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,013
我现在一个人
I'm alone now.

7
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:33,069
一个人在岛上
On the island alone.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,069
谁快来救我
Please, someone come.

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,018
其他人他们都
The others, they're...

10
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:40,049
他们都已经死了
They're dead.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,007
它杀了他们
It killed them.

12
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:46,027
它把他们全杀了
It killed them all.

13
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:51,003
-我不能再呆下去了  -你没地方可去
-I can't stay here.  -There's nowhere to go.

14
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:53,097
必须得有人走遍这个海岸 画好岛屿地图
Someone has to walk the shore and map the island.

15
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:56,023
看看还有什么东西在这儿
See what else there is.

16
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:59,002
希望还能见到你
I hope we meet again.

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,039
发生什么事了?
What's happening?

18
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,011
你知道发生什么事了
You know what's happening.

19
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:55,065
我不明白为什么
But I don't understand. Why...?

20
00:02:55,066 --> 00:03:00,017
你本应该对他负责 但你却抛弃了他 Claire
It was your responsibility, but you gave him away, Claire.

21
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:04,079
现在人人要受到报应
Everyone pays the price now.

22
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,040
Claire没...没事了
Hey, hey, hey, hey!It's Charlie! It's Charlie! It’s okay! It's okay. It’s all right.

23
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,090
你是在做梦
You were dreaming.

24
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,011
梦游罢了
You were sleepwalking. All right?

25
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,082
好
Okay.

26
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:25,042
Claire  发生什么事了?
Claire, what happened?

27
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:33,057
一定是个可怕的噩梦
Must have been a hell of a nightmare.

28
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:36,096
谁说过是噩梦了?
Who said it was a nightmare?

29
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:39,016
如果谁把拳头握得这么紧
When someone makes a fist so tight

30
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,084
指甲甚至都嵌进手掌四分之一英寸长
they dig their nails a quarter of an inch into their palms,

31
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:45,037
我说他们一定没在做着 骑马这样的好梦
they probably weren't dreaming about riding ponies.

32
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:49,096
-以前有过梦游吗?  -没我想没有
-Did you ever sleepwalk before?  -No. I don't think so.

33
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:53,019
-我怎么知道?  -会有反馈信号的
-How would I know?  -It'd get back to you.

34
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,007
我有个女朋友有一次 说我会讲梦话
I had a girlfriend once that, uh,told me I talked in my sleep.

35
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:59,084
-你说什么梦话了?  -不知道
-What did you say?  -Don't know.

36
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:03,084
不管说了什么 反正她不喜欢
Whatever it was, she didn't like it.

37
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:08,012
悉尼的妇产科医生怎样?
How was your OBIG YN in Sydney?

38
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:10,040
很好  她很好
Good. She was good.

39
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:14,047
你在怀孕的第三阶段坐飞机 她对你这样没意见?
She was okay with letting you fly in your third trimester?

40
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:18,086
是的  坐飞机的前一周我去做了检查 她说没事的
Yeah, I went for a checkup a week before, and she said it would be fine.

41
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:23,055
-超声波检测结果是好的?  -是的  非常健康
-Ultrasound was cool?  -Mm-hmm. Very healthy.

42
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:27,062
-感觉怎么样?  -还行
-How you been feeling?  -Okay.

43
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:29,076
只是背很痛
Back's pretty sore,

44
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:32,069
也许是睡在地上的缘故
but probably just from sleeping on the ground.

45
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,024
如果我站起来太快的话 会觉得头晕
I get dizzy if I stand up too fast.

46
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:39,084
还有我老想小便
And I have to pee all the time.

47
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:43,042
-吃的东西够吗?  -野猪和香蕉
-You eating enough?  -Boar and bananas.

48
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,044
怀孕已经有几周了?
How many weeks in are you?

49
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:49,026
你什么时候发现你怀孕了?
What was the date that you found out that you were pregnant?

50
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:53,000
-是粉色吗?  -我还不知道
-Is it pink?  -I don't know.

51
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:54,049
我是说你真尿在它上面了?
I mean, did you actually pee on it?

52
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,092
-是的  请给我点时间  -也许是你做的方式不对
-Just give me a second.  -Maybe you didn't do it right.

53
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:59,058
-Thomas我可以尿在一根棒上  -那是什么颜色?
-Thomas, I can pee on a stick.  -What color is it?

54
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:03,048
-多久了?  -66秒了
-How long's it been?  -Six... 66 seconds.

55
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:06,022
-糟了  -安静
-Oh, gosh.  -Shh.

56
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:08,011
好的有很明显的两条线
Okay, there's definitely two lines.

57
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:11,041
-两条粉色的线?  -粉色? 不 这看上去像红色
-Two pink lines?  -Pink? No, no, no. These are, like, red.

58
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,042
什么?
What?

59
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:14,096
是粉色
They're pink.

60
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:16,033
-这两条线  -是粉色的
-These two lines...  -They're pink.

61
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:18,018
好吧  首先这种测试并不一定准确
First of all, these tests are not always accurate.

62
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,081
不  你知道我我伯父的
No, no, no. My uncle, you know,

63
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:22,004
本来大家都以为他得了睾丸癌还记得吗?
we thought he had testicular cancer. You remember that?

64
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:24,059
-是的  他得癌了  他完蛋了  -是这样...
-He did. He's dead.  -Well, yeah...

65
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,079
我是说不不...这就个错误的...
I mean, no, no. It was like a wrong...

66
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,094
错误的诊断
It was a bad diagnosis.

67
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,070
听着...这东西 并不能完全确定你是否怀孕
This thing doesn't mean for sure you're pregnant.

68
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,003
-Thomas!  -我们应该再试一次
-Thomas!  -Get another.

69
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:35,025
我的例假已经6周没有来了 知道吗? ... 6周
I am six weeks late, okay? Six weeks.

70
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:39,020
从来没发生过这种事 我怀孕了
That never happens. I’m pregnant.

71
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:46,093
好好 听着事情会变好的
Okay. Okay, look, it’s all gonna be okay.

72
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:50,020
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

73
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,014
Claire

74
00:06:56,047 --> 00:07:00,043
你知道如果我们想要的话 我们能这么做的
You know, if we wanted to, we could do this.

75
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:01,079
不要说了
Stop it.

76
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,096
-不 我没在开玩笑  -我妈妈会不要我的
-No, I'm not kidding.  -My mom would disown me.

77
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:07,085
可以说已经不要你了
She basically has already.

78
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:13,050
是的 但我们用什么来养活孩子? 就靠我在炸鱼店每小时5美元的工作?
Yeah, and but with what? I mean, my $5-an-hour job at Fish 'n Fry?

79
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:15,056
但并不是只有你一个人有工作?
You're not the only one with a job, you know?

80
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:18,052
我意思是我能画画
I mean, I've got my painting.

81
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:24,025
这很好  但这不是我们想要的
That's sweet, but...This isn't what we want.

82
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,081
或许是
Maybe it is.

83
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:30,090
你知道吗?
You know?

84
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:33,066
这可能是....
This could be like, uh...

85
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:37,022
我不知道
I don't know.

86
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,002
这就像是我们之间最美好的东西
It could be, like, the best thing ever.

87
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:46,044
你真想试试?
You'd really want to try?

88
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:48,078
是的
Yeah.

89
00:07:55,032 --> 00:08:00,024
Claire我爱你
Claire, I love you.

90
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:19,066
这还是第一次
Well, this is a first.

91
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:24,087
一天里你站着不动什么也不做
You standing still, middle of the day, doing nothing.

92
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,009
让人惊讶
Amazing.

93
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,094
我在做事
I'm doing something.

94
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:32,057
是吗? 做什么?
Yeah? What's that?

95
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,098
淹没自己
I'm sinking.

96
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,009
水往外流带走沙子 接着你就往下沉
Water goes out, takes the sand with it and you sink.

97
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:47,066
我还是孩子的时候和我妈妈这么玩过
I used to do it with my mom when I was a kid.

98
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,018
新计划
Ah. New plan.

99
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,047
你就打算一路下沉离开这个岛
You're gonna just sink your way right off the island.

100
00:08:57,048 --> 00:09:00,019
Sayid会替你感到自豪的
Sayid would be proud.

101
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:04,063
他离开已经有一周了
He's been gone for almost a week.

102
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:08,000
我有预感他会没事的
Something tells me he'll be okay.

103
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:12,066
那你大老远跑到这儿来干什么?
So, what are you doing this far from the caves?

104
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,046
带水来
Bringing water down.

105
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:17,006
带鱼回去
Bringing fish back.

106
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:25,036
Claire马上就要生了
Claire's gonna have the baby soon.

107
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:38,067
"亲爱的日记"
Dear diary,

108
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:41,073
"我们还在这个该死的岛"上
still on the bloody island.

109
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:46,018
"今天我吞下了一只虫子"
Today, I swallowed a bug.

110
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:48,080
"爱你的  Claire"
Love, Claire.

111
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:53,006
这儿
Here.

112
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:58,013
如果我们不喝茶的话 怎么能把我们跟那些野人区分开来?
What separates us from these savage Yanks if we can't drink tea?

113
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,077
-感觉好些了?  -只是个梦罢了
-Feeling better?  -It was just a dream.

114
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:08,054
我也做过这样的梦
I have this dream.

115
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:14,055
我开着车我的牙齿开始掉落
I'm driving a bus, and my teeth start falling out.

116
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:18,053
我妈妈在后面吃着饼干
My mum is in the back, eating biscuits.

117
00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:21,071
每样东西闻起来都是熏肉的味道
Everything smells of bacon.

118
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:24,014
很古怪
It's weird.

119
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:26,083
当然我没有尖叫着醒来
Of course, I don't wake up screaming.

120
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,085
我没事Charlie
I'm all right, Charlie.

121
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,053
你当然没事
Mmm. No, of course you are.

122
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,038
只是...
It's just...

123
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:39,033
在这个地方
...I think about you

124
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,056
我很挂念你
...in this place.

125
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,009
你过得一定很艰难
How hard it must be for you,

126
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,012
没有家人没有朋友
without your family and your friends.

127
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:53,040
我想我们可以做朋友 我可以做你的朋友
And I think, we could be friends. I could be your friend.

128
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,076
我们不必给对方剪头发 或者别的一些事情
We don't have to do each other's hair or anything.

129
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:07,038
你知道我是说真的 如果你想找个人聊聊
I just mean that, you know, if you needed someone to talk to about anything,

130
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:10,064
我就在这儿
I'm here.

131
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:16,033
Charlie

132
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,031
好
Okay.

133
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,042
-我没有那种意思...  -没关系Claire
-I didn't mean that I...  -It's cool, Claire.

134
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:31,053
没关系
It's cool.

135
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:39,074
Thomas把整个阁楼都打扫干净了
Thomas cleaned out his whole loft.

136
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:41,089
我礼拜二要正式搬进去了
I'm officially moving in on Tuesday.

137
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,027
-太好了!  -我知道他很棒!
-That is great!  -I know. He's awesome.

138
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:51,045
-你知道也许我们并不应该  -不行你现在不准退缩
-You know, maybe we shouldn't...  -No. You’re not backing out now.

139
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:53,097
-感觉有点傻  -他只是能够通灵而已  Claire
-It seems silly.  -He's just a psychic, Claire.

140
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:56,083
我还以为你能接受类似于占星术的这些东西
I thought you were into this, all your astrology stuff.

141
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,080
我知道
Yeah, I know,

142
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:01,056
但我不需要谁来告诉我 我会发生什么事
but I don't need somebody telling me

143
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:02,085
我应该怎样生活
what's gonna happen or how to live my life.

144
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:05,038
这不是你需要不需要的问题 这是个有不有趣的问题
It's not about what you need. It’s about what's fun.

145
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,053
所以除非你还有其它借口
So unless you have another excuse...

146
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:13,039
我要你把手伸过来
I'll need your hands for this.

147
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:45,021
那么你什么时候发现的?
So when did you find out?

148
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:48,099
-什么?  -孩子的事
-What?  -About the baby.

149
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:58,087
两天前
Um... Two days ago.

150
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:09,035
-她还没告诉她妈妈  -嘘!
-She hasn't told her mum yet...  -Shh.

151
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:16,012
什么? 我不应该告诉她?
What, should I not tell her?

152
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:23,071
什么?是什么?
What? What is it?

153
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,057
我很抱歉
I'm sorry. Um...

154
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:31,013
我不能 我不能...
I can't... I can't...

155
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:33,033
你要你看到什么了?
What were you gonna...? What did you see?

156
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:35,015
我不给你算命了
I'm not doing this reading.

157
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:36,053
不行  你总得说些什么
No, you were gonna say something.

158
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:40,071
你们得走了 现在就请离开
You'll have to leave. Now.

159
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:44,043
谢谢 ... 非常感谢
Thanks, thanks very much.

160
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,093
真是个怪人
What a freak.

161
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:12,019
救命!
Help me!

162
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,051
有人要伤害我!求你们!救救我!
Somebody's trying to hurt me! Please! Help me!

163
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,060
-有人攻击她!  -什么?
-Someone attacked her!  -What?

164
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:22,056
-他把我摁在地上!  -他往哪个方向跑了?
-He held me down!  -Which way did he go?

165
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,014
我不知道 我什么都看不到
I don't know. I couldn't see any...

166
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:25,004
-多久前?  -发生什么事了?
-How long ago?  -What's going on?

167
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:26,071
就刚才! 他刚刚逃跑!
Just now! He just ran away!

168
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:28,004
我们在周围的山洞分头找找
We should fan out and check the surrounding caves.

169
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,070
-等等等等  -Hurley快我们走
-Wait, wait, hold on.  -Hurley, come on, let's go.

170
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:35,008
我们坐下好吗?
Come on. Come on. Let’s sit down here, okay?

171
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,029
-你能给她弄些水吗?  -好的
-Can you get her some water?  -Sure.

172
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,036
Claire看着我  没事了 你现在很安全
Claire, look at me. It’s okay. You're safe now.

173
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:43,035
-你有没看清楚他?  -没有很暗  我看不见
-Did you get a look at him at all?  -It was dark. I couldn't see.

174
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:46,000
-哪儿发生的事?  -就这儿!
-Where did this happen?  -He was here!

175
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:51,098
我正在睡觉  我刚醒来的时候他正要伤害我的孩子
I mean, I was sleeping, and I woke up, and he was trying to hurt my baby!

176
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:55,030
他有针之类的东西
He had this thing, like a needle,

177
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:58,096
他用那东西扎我!
and he stabbed me with it!

178
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:04,014
他要伤害我的孩子!
He was trying to hurt my baby.

179
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:07,063
没事了  没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

180
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:14,064
这整个地方我们都找过了老兄
We hoofed around the entire perimeter, man.

181
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:16,019
没人看到或听到什么吗?
Nobody saw or heard anything?

182
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,023
什么都没有 大家都在睡觉
Uh-uh. Nada. Everyone was asleep.

183
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,076
我有个想法
So, I had an idea.

184
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:25,033
我在这儿找某个精神病患者 叫Scott或者叫Steve什么的对吧?
I'm out here looking for some psycho with Scott and Steve, right?

185
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:28,074
我突然意识到这Scott和Steve他妈的是谁呢?
And I'm realizing, who the hell are Scott and Steve?

186
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,094
我不懂你的意思
I'm not following you.

187
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,087
如果我是个警察  某个妇女遭到攻击了 我们会彻底细查是吧?
Look, if I was a cop, and some woman got attacked, we’d canvas, right?

188
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:36,008
去敲门找出目击证人
Knock on doors, find witnesses.

189
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,044
但我们现在连门都没有
But we don't even have doors.

190
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,013
Hurley你这么说我还是不明白 你是要...
You're not helping me understand...

191
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:42,091
我们不知道谁住在这儿  谁住在岸边
We don't know who's living here, and who's still at the beach.

192
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:44,089
我意思是大家 甚至各自都不了解
I mean, we don't even know each other.

193
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,027
我的名字不是Hurley而是Hugo Reyes
My name isn't Hurley. It’s Hugo Reyes.

194
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:50,094
Hurley只是个昵称  明白?
Hurley's just a nickname I have, all right?

195
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:53,007
为什么呢? 为什么我没告诉你?
Why? I'm not telling.

196
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:55,021
关键是我们得找出岛上各个人的身份
The point is, we got to find out who everyone is.

197
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,024
你要搞人口调查?
You want to start a census?

198
00:15:56,025 --> 00:16:00,017
是的  登记一下姓名 谁长什么样  谁和谁有关系
A registry. Names, what people look like, who’s related to who.

199
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:03,017
我们要立个法 或许这样人们就不会相互攻击了
We lay down the law, people will stop attacking each other.

200
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:06,042
似乎这儿隔三差五就有有谁被捶或者谁被刺了一刀的事情
Seems like someone's punched or stabbed every other day.

201
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:09,032
我们得找出是谁攻击了她
We got to find out who did this to her.

202
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,062
你还好吗?
You all right?

203
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,047
不用担心
Don't worry.

204
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:33,051
如果你想闭上眼睛睡觉
If you want to close your eyes,

205
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:36,031
我会整晚都在这儿的
I'll be here all night.

206
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:39,038
我不会让任何人接近你
I won't let anyone get to you.

207
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:45,086
我不会离开你Claire 我保证
I won't leave you, Claire. Promise.

208
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:58,074
-我们有窗帘了  -我知道
-Wow, we have drapes now.  -I know.

209
00:16:58,075 --> 00:17:01,015
我感到自己长大了
I feel all grown up.

210
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,033
喜欢这窗帘吗?
You like 'em?

211
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,099
是的  他们很漂亮
Yeah. They're good.

212
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,072
我不知道为什么窗帘 对我来说意味着年龄
I don't know why drapes represent age for me.

213
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:11,084
我感觉这种事情总应该让我妈来做
I guess it just feels like something my mum would do.

214
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:13,073
Sasha打来电话
Oh, um, Sasha called.

215
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:18,015
他们今晚要出去 问我们去不去
They're going out tonight. They wanted to know if we'd go.

216
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:23,038
什么?
What?

217
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,012
我没有把薯片吃完 还有一袋呢
I didn't eat all the chips. There’s another bag.

218
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,084
Claire?

219
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,090
我不能这么做
I can't do this.

220
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,020
做什么?
Do what?

221
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:40,080
你今天过得不开心?
Did you have a bad day?

222
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,043
这不管用
This isn't working.

223
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:49,010
拜托...你知道的
Come on, you knew that.

224
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:51,022
我知道什么?
I what?

225
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:03,015
是不是我太敏感了...
Just so I'm not overreacting here,

226
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,064
你要和我分手?
are you breaking up with me?

227
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:07,056
过去的三个月只是
For the past three months, it's just,

228
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:09,089
你知道总是会有些计划  有些责任
there's some plan, some responsibility,

229
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,016
我们得去哪儿 得和哪些人说话
somewhere we have to be, someone you have to talk to.

230
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:14,070
是啊  我只是想确保孩子出生的时候
I'm trying to make sure when the baby comes...

231
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:18,060
"孩子出生"? 是我是说那不只是...
"When the baby..." Yeah.I mean, that is just not...

232
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:23,097
如果照这种情况下去 孩子出生的时候事情又会怎样?
If it's like this now, you know, what’s it gonna be like when the baby comes?

233
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:26,024
但是是你说我们应该这么做的
But you said we should do this.

234
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:27,054
是
Yeah.

235
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:30,043
是的  但现在我说的才是真话
Yeah, well, now it's real.

236
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:32,025
你不能随便改变主意
You can't just change your mind.

237
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:35,031
你叫我怎么当个爸爸  Claire?
How in the hell am I supposed to be a dad, Claire?

238
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,031
我的画怎么办? 我的生活呢?
How about my painting? My life?

239
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,095
我知道 ...我早知道事情会变成这样
I knew... I knew this was gonna happen.

240
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:41,044
"我告诉过你这些"真是完美
I told you so. Perfect.

241
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:43,029
现在所有的什么"弃妇弃子"的头衔都套在我头上了
Now I get all your daddy abandonment crap.

242
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,097
你这杂种 你敢说你做的是对的?!
Hey, you bastard, don't you dare try and justify what you're doing!

243
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:48,055
我做过什么了?
I have done nothing!

244
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:50,054
-我什么都没做过  -什么?  那是我错了?
-I've done absolutely nothing.  -What, I have?

245
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:52,079
你还以为我不知道 你干的那些好事?
You don't think I've seen what you've done?

246
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
麻烦你再说一遍?
Excuse me?

247
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:57,005
你本应该吃药的
You were supposed to be on the Pill.

248
00:18:57,006 --> 00:19:00,037
-你认为我是故意怀孕的?  -我才不在乎
-You think I got pregnant on purpose?  -I don't even care.

249
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,002
你认为这是我搞的一个计划?
Or that this was some kind of plan?

250
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:04,012
-你脑袋是不是坏掉了!  -都结束了Claire!
-You are out of your mind!  -It's over, Claire!

251
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:05,060
不  还没结束!
No, it's not over!

252
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,056
-我要走了  -Thomas!
-I'm out of here.  -Thomas!

253
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,029
John对吧?  John Locke?
John, right? John Locke?

254
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,033
这就是你的人口调查?
Is this about your census?

255
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:30,073
是的你知道 我觉得这是个好点子你知道
Yeah, you know, I thought it would be a good idea, you know,

256
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:34,060
记下每个人的名字和住所
get everyone's name and place of residence.

257
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:37,016
那谁来登记你呢?
And who's checking on you?

258
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:40,001
呃...我自己
Uh, me.

259
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:42,046
开玩笑了
It was a joke.

260
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:47,005
还真好笑...
Uh, good one.

261
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:48,055
是啊
Yep.

262
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,011
你已经知道我的名字了
You already know my name.

263
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:53,088
我大半辈子都住在加州的Tustin
I lived most of my life in Tustin, California.

264
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:57,090
好的...还有你旅行的原因?
Cool. And reason for travel?

265
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:00,089
你在澳大利亚的原因?
The reason you were in Australia?

266
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,057
我在找东西
I was looking for something.

267
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:04,047
找东西 ... 啊哈
Looking. Uh-huh.

268
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:06,040
好极了
Right on.

269
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,062
找一些东西
Something.

270
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:11,065
那么你找到了吗?
So, did you find it?

271
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,063
没  它找到我了
No, it found me.

272
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,043
还需要知道些什么吗?
Anything else?

273
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:21,072
不  没了  很好
No, no, that's good.

274
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:23,043
谢谢
Uh, thanks.

275
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:25,068
嘿呃我知道我已经和你谈过了
Hey, uh, I know I already talked to you,

276
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:28,011
我只是想离开他一会儿
but I just wanted to get away from him for a second.

277
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:30,093
你看到昨晚有谁离开海岸了?
Did you see anyone leave the beach last night?

278
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:33,021
人们来来往往  但...
People come and go, but...

279
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,087
不  我不知道
No, I don't know.

280
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,005
什么?
What?

281
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:39,081
我不知道是否真有其事
I'm not sure anything happened.

282
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:41,097
什么意思?
Wait, what?

283
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:45,099
Claire告诉我和Michael 袭击者试图用东西刺她
Claire told Michael and I that this attacker tried to inject her with something.

284
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,067
但她腹部并没有伤痕
But there was no mark on her stomach.

285
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:49,021
她两次都是在连续的尖叫声中醒来
She wakes up two nights screaming.

286
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:51,002
第一次她是在梦游
First time, sleepwalking.

287
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:52,094
你认为这都是她编造出来的?她受到惊吓了伙计
Think she's making this up? She was terrified.

288
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,073
听她说那家伙要伤害她的孩子
She said he was hurting her baby.

289
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:57,067
大家都睡在周围 那个人为什么要这么做?
Why would someone do that With us 20 feet away?

290
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:58,080
-所以你认为她是在撒谎?  -不
-You think she's lying?  -No.

291
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:01,059
-怀孕的女子头脑尤其清醒  -头脑清醒对
-Pregnant woman have extremely lucid...  -Lucid.

292
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,094
这些就是典型的"噩梦焦虑症"
Textbook anxiety nightmares.

293
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,002
你对大家的情况都很了解?
You know everything that's going on with everyone?

294
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:10,062
那么我们该怎么做?
So, what do we do?

295
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:13,082
Claire的预产期只有一周多一点了 或许两周
Claire's due in a little more than a week. Maybe two.

296
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:17,008
但如果她的神经再绷得这么紧 或者再受到一次惊吓
But if she stays stressed out like this

297
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,021
会造成早产的
or has another panic attack,

298
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:24,070
而这儿没有手术工具 没有监控器  也没麻醉剂
it could trigger an early labor. Out here with no instruments, no monitors, no anesthetic...

299
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:27,083
事情会很不妙的
That would not be good.

300
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:31,043
她还没想过这些
It's not all in her head.

301
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:40,001
-嘿 Lance  -抱歉?
-Hey, Lance.  -Sorry?

302
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:42,042
Lance你叫Lance对吧?
Lance. Your name's Lance, right?

303
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:45,029
-Ethan  -老兄  哦对
-Ethan.  -Dude, that's right.

304
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,069
Lance是个瘦瘦的小伙 带着眼镜  红头发
Lance is a skinny guy with glasses and red hair.

305
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,000
我觉得你把我们都搞混了
I can see how you'd confuse us.

306
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:54,006
对不起  老兄  名字太多了 面孔太多了  我真是累啊
Sorry, dude. Lots of names and faces.

307
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:56,022
你和岛上的这些人 都已经相处好几周了
Pathetic. You'd think after a couple weeks on the island with the same people,

308
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,017
大家都应该相互了解了
we'd know each other.

309
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,085
是的  你说得没错 你会有这种想法的
You're right. You would think so.

310
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:01,040
我们在列清单
So we're doing this list,

311
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,033
所有的生还者的姓名 家庭住址之类的东西
all the survivors' names, home addresses, stuff like that.

312
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:06,049
好  你已经知道我的名字了
Okay, well, you already have my name.

313
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,082
-好的  不叫Lance  -绝对不是
-All right, not Lance.  -Definitely not.

314
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,096
-姓什么?  -Rom
-Last name?  -Rom.

315
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,075
-Rom ... "r-o-m"?  -是的
-Rom, R-O-M?  -That's right.

316
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:15,030
很好你是哪里人  Ethan Rom?
Great. Where you from, Ethan Rom?

317
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:18,023
-安大略湖  -好极了  我喜欢加拿大
-Ontario.  -Right on. Love Canada. Great, uh...

318
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:20,054
好的
Well,

319
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,086
都记下了 感谢你抽出时间  老兄
that should do it. Thanks for your time, dude.

320
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:26,046
你记这些干什么用?
Hey, what's this for?

321
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:31,038
没什么...只是我个人觉得这是个好主意
Oh, it's nothing. Just, you know, thought it'd be a good idea.

322
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:37,043
Claire?

323
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:39,009
你找到他了?
Did you find him?

324
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,024
呃  没有
Um, no.

325
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:44,024
要是他再回来怎么办?
What if he comes back?

326
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:50,093
Claire我们碰到的这种情况
Claire...This situation that we're in,

327
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:54,083
坠机...没人到这地方来救我们
the crash, that no one's coming, this place,

328
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:57,043
这都会在你的脑中形成一种混乱
it can kind of mess with your head a little

329
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,087
或许还会让你的感觉失真
and make you see things that aren't actually there.

330
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:05,003
-我知道那感觉非常真实  -我不明白
-Now, I know it feels very real...  -I don't under...

331
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:08,097
你要生孩子了 ... 很快
Look, your baby's coming. ... Soon.

332
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:12,053
我甚至无法想象 这对你来说有多么的恐惧
And I can't even imagine how scary that must be for you.

333
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:15,073
但是你感觉越不安 你就会越危险
But the more upset you are, the more dangerous it is for you,

334
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:18,025
还会涉及到你的孩子
and your baby.

335
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:22,070
所以我要你吃这些药
So I want you to take these.

336
00:23:22,071 --> 00:23:24,036
这是什么?
What are they?

337
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,053
这是镇静药
It's a sedative.

338
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:29,038
药力比较温和 通常适用于你这样的情况
Very mild, commonly used in situations like yours.

339
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,072
对孩子不会有伤害  我保证
It won't harm the baby. I promise.

340
00:23:33,073 --> 00:23:36,058
你不相信我
You don't believe me.

341
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:37,036
Claire

342
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:40,080
你认为这是我编造出来的?
You think I'm making this up?

343
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:43,095
我受到了攻击 你却给我安眠药?
I get attacked, and you want to give me sleeping pills?

344
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:46,076
这不是安眠药 ... 听着 这是一种非常温和的镇定药物  Claire
They're not sleeping...Look, it's a very mild sedative.

345
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:49,056
-我要走了  -什么?  不行!  Claire
-I'm leaving.  -What? No! Claire. Claire...

346
00:23:49,057 --> 00:23:52,002
在海边会安全点 这儿并不安全
It was safe at the beach. It’s not safe here.

347
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:54,048
不要这么做  Claire 你得考虑到你的孩子  Claire
Don't do this. Think about the baby.

348
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,075
不要和我谈孩子的事情
Don't talk to me about the baby.

349
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:58,061
我讨厌人们告诉我该怎么做
I'm sick of everyone telling me what to do.

350
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,055
-求你了  -让我走
-Please...  -Let go of me.

351
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,097
你没事吧?
You okay?

352
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:09,013
你对她说什么了?
What did you say to her?

353
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,086
什么事?
Yes?

354
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:30,094
-Malkin先生我们以前见过吗?  -是的  我记得
-Mr. Malkin, we met before?  -Yes, I remember.

355
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:36,044
当时你不肯给我算命 希望你现在不要拒绝
You wouldn't give me a reading. I was hoping you would now.

356
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:48,003
如果你能通灵 为什么还要数钱?
If you're a psychic, why do you have to count it?

357
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:49,076
算命可不是数钱算出来的
That's not how it works.

358
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:52,069
我只是开个玩笑
I was just joking.

359
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:10,059
-那么你是如何算出来的?  -我不知道
-So... how does it work?  -I don't know.

360
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:21,058
他什么时候离开你的?
When did he leave you?

361
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,024
上周
Last week.

362
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:28,025
上次你不肯给我算命 是因为这件事吗?
Is that why you didn't want to do my reading?

363
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,080
不  上次我看到了些东西 一些比较模糊的东西
No, no, no. I saw something, sort of a blurry thing.

364
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:38,002
-模糊中透露出不好?  -不好
-And Blurry's bad?  -Blurry's bad.

365
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,018
那才是我停止给你算命的原因
That's why I stopped the reading.

366
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:43,070
你确定这次要我继续给你算命?
Are you sure you want to go on now?

367
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:49,082
是的  麻烦你
Yes, please.

368
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,027
我可以告诉你
I can tell you,

369
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:15,097
这非常重要
this is important.

370
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:16,099
好的
Okay.

371
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,018
你必须自己抚养这个孩子 这一点至关重要
It is crucial that you, yourself, raise this child.

372
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,094
你意思是和Thomas一起抚养?他是...
You mean with Thomas? Is he...?

373
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:29,074
孩子的父亲不能进入孩子的生活领域也不能进入你的
The father of this child will play no part in its life, nor yours.

374
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:31,073
那么你到底想表达什么意思?
So, what exactly are you saying?

375
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:37,012
这孩子如果让除你之外的任何人抚养
This child parented by anyone else, anyone other than you...

376
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:41,027
孩子将会有危险
Danger surrounds this baby.

377
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:42,033
危险?
Danger?

378
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,025
你的本性  你的精神
Your nature, your spirit,

379
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:49,059
你的善良一定得影响到孩子的成长
your goodness must be an influence in the development of this child.

380
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:57,073
听着  如果Thomas和我不能和好的话
Look, if Thomas and I don’t, you know, get back together,

381
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,069
我就会让别人收养我的孩子
I'm putting this baby up for adoption.

382
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:04,052
我只是想来搞清楚怎样才能给我孩子一个快乐的人生
I just wanted to find out what would give the baby the happiest life.

383
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:07,010
没有快乐的人生
There is no happy life.

384
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:10,041
没有你  孩子就不会有这样的快乐
Not for this child, not without you.

385
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:12,094
-我不...  -不能让其他人收养
-I don't...  -There can't be another.

386
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:15,022
你不准让其他人收养你的孩子
You mustn't allow another to raise your baby.

387
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:16,090
好  棒极了
Okay. Great.

388
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:19,087
-感谢你拿了我的200美元  -听着  钱你拿着
-Thanks for taking my 200.  -Look, take it.

389
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:23,013
Littleton小姐 我求你考虑一下
Miss Littleton,I am begging you just to consider...

390
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:25,026
我不能自己抚养这个孩子
I can't raise this child by myself.

391
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,048
你必须听我的!
You have to listen to me!

392
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:28,019
好感谢你抽出时间 还把钱还给了我!
Thanks for your time and my money back!

393
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,098
Littleton女士求你了!孩子需要你的保护!
The baby needs your protection!

394
00:27:33,072 --> 00:27:35,025
Littleton女士!
Miss Littleton!

395
00:27:35,026 --> 00:27:37,045
求你了!
Please!

396
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:48,034
喂?
Hello?

397
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:50,019
Littleton女士  我是Richard Malkin
Miss Littleton, it's Richard Malkin.

398
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,052
上帝
Oh, my God.

399
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:55,053
听我说我有个计划 一个会让事情好转的计划
Listen to me. I have a plan, something that will make this all better.

400
00:27:55,054 --> 00:27:57,063
你不要再打电话给我了
You've got to stop calling me.

401
00:27:57,064 --> 00:28:01,040
太晚了  好吗?我明天就去收养中心了
It's too late, all right? I’m going to see Adoptive Services tomorrow.

402
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:04,040
我已经告诉你几个月了 你不能这么做
I've been telling you for months, you cannot do that.

403
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,057
我怎么处理我的孩子 不关你的事
What I do with my baby is none of your business.

404
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,045
如果你不按照我跟你说的做
If you don't do what I'm suggesting,

405
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:10,046
将有大祸降临于你和你的孩子
great danger will befall...

406
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:12,005
不  如果你半夜三更 还这样给我打电话的话
Great danger will befall you if you don't stop calling me

407
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:14,029
你才会倒大霉
In the middle of the night.

408
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,032
我知道你内心什么感受  Claire
I know what you're feeling inside.

409
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:19,002
你在考虑你是否真要把孩子送人
You're doubting your decision to give up the baby.

410
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:22,062
听着  算我求你  不要这么做 至少先听听我的计划
Look, I'm begging you, don't do it. At least hear my plan first.

411
00:28:22,063 --> 00:28:24,072
晚安
Good night.

412
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,085
你去哪?
Where are you going?

413
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:36,058
回海边去
Back to the beach.

414
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,075
发生什么事了?
Well, what happened?

415
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:40,099
-Jack他...  -Jack想给我灌药
-Did Jack...?  -Jack tried to dope me.

416
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,088
他认为这些都是我编造出来的
He thinks I'm making all this up,

417
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,060
这些事其实并没有发生
that none of it really happened.

418
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:50,019
对所以为了证明你清醒的很 你就想一个人穿过这片丛林
Right. So, to prove your sanity, you go tromping through the jungle alone.

419
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,033
做得好
Well done.

420
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:58,093
我没有疯  Charlie
I'm not crazy, Charlie.

421
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,084
你要我的信息?
You want my information?

422
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:12,003
名字  Shannon Rutherford
Name: Shannon Rutherford.

423
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:13,032
年龄  20
Age: 20.

424
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:15,080
住址  Craphole岛
Address: Craphole Island.

425
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:19,053
那么昨晚你俩去哪了?
So, uh, where were you guys last night?

426
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:22,059
海边
Um, the beach.

427
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,095
你调查干什么?
Why the interrogation?

428
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,095
你是第20个问我这个问题的人
You're like the twentieth person to ask me that.

429
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:30,029
为什么人们对回答一些问题感到紧张?
Why is everyone uptight about answering questions?

430
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:35,029
也许人们对你设立"爱国者法案"不太满意
Well, maybe we're just not cool with you setting up your own little Patriot Act, man.

431
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,069
他是个自由主义者
He's a liberal.

432
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,080
说真的为什么要列清单?
Seriously, why the list?

433
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:42,063
没什么  只是昨晚山谷里面发生了点意外
It's nothing. We had an incident in the valley last night.

434
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:43,060
意外?
An incident?

435
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:46,011
是的Claire那个怀孕的女孩 你认识她吗?
Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl. You know her?

436
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:50,036
她...可以说是受到了攻击
She, uh, kind of got attacked.

437
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:51,077
-什么?!   -她没事吧?
-What?  -She okay?

438
00:29:51,078 --> 00:29:52,098
是的...她有点惊吓过度但...
Yeah, she's a little shook up, but...

439
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:57,043
我才不搬去那个鬼山洞!
I am not moving to the Rape Caves.

440
00:29:58,003 --> 00:30:00,081
你知道去找张旅客名单事情就好办多了
Your life would be much easier if you just had the manifest.

441
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:03,056
我们烧机身的时候已经把死者的名字划去了
We crossed out names of the dead after we burned the fuselage,

442
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:06,024
所以我们生还者的名字都登记在册的
so should be a full roster of the rest of us.

443
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:09,009
什么?真的吗?谁有?
What? Really? Who has it?

444
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,061
你觉得呢?
Who do you think?

445
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:23,081
我就开门见山了
I'm just gonna lay it out straight.

446
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:25,068
好的  你说吧
Okay, you do that.

447
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:27,020
我听说你有旅客名单
I hear you have the flight manifest,

448
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:30,075
我要用 所以我要你把它给我
and I need it and want you to give it to me.

449
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,001
就这样?
That so?

450
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:36,033
现在你可以做出反应了 人们请你帮忙时  你都会这么做的
Now, you could do what you normally do when someone asks for something,

451
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,059
告诉我"滚开"
tell me to screw off.

452
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,059
滚开?
Screw off?

453
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:44,006
或者你可以把它给我
Or you could just give it to me.

454
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:49,007
因为老兄你品德很好
'Cause, dude, you could use the points.

455
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,094
老天  你可真会奉承  胖子
Well, gosh, you sure know how to butter a man up, Stay-Puff.

456
00:30:53,095 --> 00:30:56,026
这是天赋
It's a gift.

457
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:05,015
旅客名单在褐色的手提箱里 你拿去吧
Manifest is in the brown suitcase. Take it.

458
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:07,040
我来帮你背包吧
Please let me carry your bag.

459
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,028
我能行
I'm fine.

460
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:10,037
我知道你能行 但还是我来背包吧
I know you're fine, but I can carry your bag.

461
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:12,030
为什么你老跟在我后面?
Why did you come after me?

462
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:16,061
可能是因为我喜欢你吧
Well, it's probably because I like you.

463
00:31:16,077 --> 00:31:18,009
什么?
What?

464
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,047
你不喜欢我  Charlie 你明白吗?
You don't like me, Charlie, okay?

465
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:23,056
你想救我只是因为我...
You just want to rescue me because I'm...

466
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:25,041
因为这东西
Because of this.

467
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:29,096
但我没事好吧?我不需要援救  我不...
But I'm fine, okay? I don't need rescuing. I don't need...

468
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:31,079
Claire?

469
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,055
什么? 怎么了? Claire? 你怎么了?
What? Claire, what? What is it?

470
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:42,044
-又宫缩了?  -是的
-Was that another one?  -Yeah.

471
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:44,020
好的...我们得计算宫缩频率
We need to time the contractions.

472
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:45,095
那就是你要做的 计算宫缩频率  好吗?
That's what you do. Time the contractions, okay?

473
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:48,002
一个糖李子仙女 两个糖李子仙女
One sugar plum fairy, two sugar plum fairy...

474
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:50,075
你得平静下来好吗?
You just need to calm down, all right?

475
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:53,009
深呼吸
Big deep breaths.

476
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:56,089
Charlie我要你去把Jack叫来
I need you to go get Jack.

477
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,007
-什么?  -我没事的
-What?  -I'll be all right.

478
00:31:58,008 --> 00:31:59,023
我不会留下你一个人的 我会接生小孩
I'm not leaving you alone. I can deliver a baby.

479
00:31:59,024 --> 00:32:01,005
-我能做到的  -拜托去叫吧!
-I can do this.  -Please, go!

480
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,080
Charlie你不知道如何接生
You don't know how to...

481
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:04,076
等等...听我说 我不会再让你发生意外的
Listen.I might not know what I'm doing,

482
00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:06,030
我或许不知道怎么做 但我会想出来的
but I'll figure it out.

483
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:09,027
我既然能戒毒 我就能接生孩子
If I can kick drugs,I can deliver a baby.

484
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,095
让我解释 我沉迷于毒品
Let me explain. I'm a drug addict.

485
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,013
我曾经沉迷于毒品 我现在已经戒掉了
I was a drug addict. I'm clean now.

486
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:15,048
叫Jack去!
Get Jack!

487
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:17,056
好的
Right.

488
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:31,066
Arlene和Joseph将带你去墨尔本
Arlene and Joseph will bring you to Melbourne.

489
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:34,051
他们会付给你生活与医疗费用
They'll pay your living and medical expenses.

490
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:38,093
我们给你找了间公寓 有两个卧室真的很好而且
We found you an apartment. It’s a really nice two-bedroom place,

491
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:41,050
而且我们认为你会住得很舒适的
and we think you're gonna be really comfortable in it.

492
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:45,018
正如我们先前说好的 孩子一出生就要交给Stewarts夫妇
As discussed, once the baby's born and handed over to the Stewarts,

493
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:47,075
你以后再也没权力去看望这个孩子
you'll have no right to see the child again.

494
00:32:47,076 --> 00:32:50,018
你也没权力和孩子联络
You'll have no right to correspond with the child,

495
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:52,066
至于是否告诉孩子关于你的事
it will be entirely up to Arlene and Joseph

496
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:55,061
一切都得由Arlene和Joseph决定
to decide whether to tell the child anything about you.

497
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:58,005
明白吗?
Understood?

498
00:32:58,016 --> 00:32:59,051
是的
Yes.

499
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:01,006
除了医院的费用
Upon your discharge from the hospital,

500
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:05,038
他们将额外再支付你20000美元
you will be given an additional payment of $20,000.

501
00:33:07,093 --> 00:33:11,095
我只是想确保你们会真的照顾好孩子
I just want to make sure that you're gonna take really good care of the baby.

502
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:14,039
我们当然会的
Of course we will.

503
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,096
现在我需要你在协议下面签字写上日期
Now, I'll need you to sign and date here where indicated.

504
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:31,076
你知道"Catch a falling star"这首歌吗?
Do you know Catch a Falling Star?

505
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:34,003
这首歌像摇篮曲
It's a song, like a lullaby.

506
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:37,089
"Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket"

507
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:43,014
小时候我爸就常唱给我听
My dad used to sing that to me when I was little.

508
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:48,082
你们能有空给孩子唱这首歌吗?
Do you think you could sing it to the baby once in a while?

509
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:51,045
当然
Of course.

510
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:10,081
-这支笔没墨水了  -用这支
-It's not working.  -Here.

511
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:47,017
我 ... 我 ... 我很抱歉 我不能这么做
I'm...I'm... I'm sorry. I can't do this.

512
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:51,057
什么?不!不!

513
00:34:56,024 --> 00:35:00,059
是什么?  你的建议是什么?
Okay, what is it? What’s your offer?

514
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:10,078
感谢上帝! 你叫什么名字来着?
Thank God! What's your name?

515
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,035
Ethan你行吗?
Ethan. Are you all right?

516
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:14,023
你得跑去山洞那儿叫Jack
Go the caves. Run to the caves. Get Jack.

517
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:16,025
-告诉他Claire...  -Claire她没事吧?
-Tell him Claire...  -Claire. She okay?

518
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:18,030
她要生了快去好吗?
She's having the baby. Go fast, okay?

519
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:20,011
我和她在一起 ... 就在那边的小路
I'll be with her, on the path there.

520
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:22,030
快去!
Go!

521
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,056

522
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:38,086

523
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:41,067
Claire!好的  Jack马上就来
Claire! Okay, Jack's coming.

524
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,055
感觉怎么样?
How you doing?

525
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,079
很疼
It hurts.

526
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,030
好  抓住我的手
Okay, just take my hand.

527
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:46,025
紧握
Squeeze.

528
00:35:46,026 --> 00:35:47,020
好的 呼吸
Okay, breathe.

529
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,031
吸气  呼气
Inhale. Exhale.

530
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:52,025
很好  呼吸
Good. Just breathe.

531
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:55,072
吸气 好...很好
Inhale. Okay, good.

532
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:58,001
我本不应该来这儿的
Oh, I'm not supposed to be here.

533
00:35:58,002 --> 00:35:59,085
我俩都有这个想法
We all feel like that a little bit.

534
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:02,063
我知道只是
I know. It's just...

535
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:05,044
有人向我保证事情不会这样的
Someone promised me it would be different.

536
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:09,069
但他说错了
Well, he was wrong.

537
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:12,083
是的他说错了
Yeah. He was wrong.

538
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:17,071
你用四个月的时间告诉我 我得自己抚养这个孩子
You spent the last four months telling me I have to raise the baby myself.

539
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:20,050
现在你却给我钱 说我不必这么做?
Now you're giving me money and saying I don't have to?

540
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:24,013
我在洛杉矶找到了一对 渴望收养孩子的夫妇
I found a couple in Los Angeles who are very eager to adopt.

541
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:26,072
孩子在他们的照管下会很安全的
The baby will be safe in their care.

542
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:29,073
-现在我预见到  -你预见到?!
-Now, I've foreseen...  -You've foreseen.

543
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:31,078
我甚至不知道我为什么来这儿 抱歉
I don't even know why I'm here. I'm sorry.

544
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,013
我知道这听起来很荒唐 Claire  所有这些占星学的东西
I know this sounds ridiculous, Claire, all this psychic business,

545
00:36:36,014 --> 00:36:39,083
我知道你一定会认为 我是个胡言乱语的疯子
and I appreciate that you must think I'm a raving madman.

546
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:43,098
但该来的总会来的
But this is what must happen.

547
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:50,022
那么你会给我6000美元
So you're giving me $6,000

548
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:54,048
把我的孩子送给洛杉矶的一对陌生夫妇?
to give my baby to a couple of strangers in Los Angeles?

549
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:56,002
12000美元
$12,000.

550
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:58,078
另外6000美元等你到洛杉矶的时候再给你
The other six when you arrive in Los Angeles.

551
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,066
他们不是陌生人Claire 他们是一对好夫妇
And they're not strangers, Claire. They’re good people.

552
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:10,045
-那种古里古怪的人?  -我知道这很另人难为情
-A psychic?  -I know. It's embarrassing.

553
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:16,031
经历了这么多 他真的很关心这件事
And after everything, he was just full of it.

554
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:23,077
或许不关心
Or not.

555
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:31,034
我意思是他的想法是 不要让任何人领养你的孩子对吧?
I mean, all he wanted was that no one else raise your baby, right?

556
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:36,040
或许他早就知道了
Maybe he knew.

557
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:37,083
我是说
I mean,

558
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:40,032
如果他想让事情变得足够的糟糕
if you wanted it bad enough...

559
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:42,093
你知道...如果他有那种天赋
You know, if he had the gift,

560
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:46,025
我相信有些人有...
and I believe some people do...

561
00:37:46,074 --> 00:37:50,019
那么他早就知道 会发生这样的事  Claire
Maybe he knew, Claire.

562
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:05,011
明天我不能去 我得去取我的...
I can't go tomorrow. I have to get my...

563
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:07,086
必须得坐这个航班 不能选其它的
It has to be this flight. It can't be any other.

564
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:10,018
你抵达的时候 他们已经安排好和你会面了
They're already scheduled to meet you when you arrive.

565
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:14,075
815号航班 815号航班
Flight 815. Flight 815.

566
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:28,091
洛杉矶根本没那对夫妇
There was no couple in Los Angeles.

567
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:31,078
他早知道了
He knew.

568
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,019
他知道飞机会...
He knew about the plane,

569
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,018
会发生什么事...
what was gonna happen...

570
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,015
上帝...他居然知道
Oh, my God, he knew.

571
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:53,099
感觉又要宫缩了吗?
You feel another one coming?

572
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,045
我不觉得
I don't think so.

573
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:02,041
Jack到底去哪了?
Where the hell is Jack?

574
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:07,010
我想...
You know, I think...

575
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:09,088
我想我没事了
I think I'm all right.

576
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:11,038
宫缩吗?
The contractions?

577
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,006
或许那是最后一次宫缩
Maybe that was the last one.

578
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:17,069
希望那就是最后一次吧
Please, let that have been the last one.

579
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:24,026
Jack说过压力会导致分娩的假象
Jack said that stress can cause a false labor.

580
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:27,009
你确定没事?
You sure you're all right?

581
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:30,002
不疼了
No pain.

582
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,075
避开紧急分娩了
Birthing emergency averted.

583
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:37,024
我说过我会照顾好你的
I told you I'd take care of you.

584
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:38,096
谢谢你Charlie
Thanks, Charlie.

585
00:39:38,097 --> 00:39:41,093
你太客气了
You're quite welcome.

586
00:39:43,062 --> 00:39:46,090
你觉得你能坚持回到山洞吗?
You think you can make it back to the caves?

587
00:39:49,002 --> 00:39:52,014
我不会让你发生任何意外
I won't let anything happen to you.

588
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,074
好的

总共是46个人
