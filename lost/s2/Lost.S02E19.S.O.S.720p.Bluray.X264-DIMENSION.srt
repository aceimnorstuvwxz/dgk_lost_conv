1
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:03,058
上集回顾
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:07,039
就是这儿 这有个界线
Right here, there's a line.

3
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:08,096
你要是越过着界线
You cross that line,

4
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:13,021
那就不是什么误会的事了
we go from misunderstanding to...something else.

5
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:14,046
我该怎么做?
What do I do?

6
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:16,052
去按那些按钮
That button has to be pushed.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,008
我从来都没有输入过那些数字
I never entered the numbers.

8
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:27,014
我从来没碰过那些按钮
I never pressed the button.

9
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:28,033
你说谎
You're lying.

10
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,060
没有 我从不说谎
No, I'm done lying.

11
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:34,083
的确是降落伞
It's a parachute.

12
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:52,094
这样 bernard 谷类食品放在左边
All right.Cereal goes on the left, Bernard.

13
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,083
这样做会让你很麻烦吗?
So this isn't bothering you at all?

14
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,046
哪里的话
What's "this"?

15
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:00,008
好的 就是这个
Well, this.

16
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,058
这个
This.

17
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:04,027
为什么这么一包土豆条却让我感到困惑?
Why is a bag of potato chips gonna bother me?

18
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:07,039
难道你对这些东西是从哪儿来的就不感到一点好奇?
Well, aren't you remotely curiousas to where all this came from?

19
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,072
你就像刚从超市回来一样
You're acting like we just got back from the supermarket.

20
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:14,032
好的 我猜想我从来没有因为我所受到的恩惠而被质疑过
Well, I guess I was raised never to question my blessings.

21
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:18,046
我却对这些贴上古怪标签的食物感到奇怪
I was raised to question piles of food with weird labels

22
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,063
rose 这简直就是天上掉下来的馅饼
that just fall out of the sky, Rose.

23
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:22,021
亲爱的 只是因为天气不好吗?
Well, honey,just because you're having a bad day,

24
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:23,096
但也不用扯着嗓子喊啊
doesn't mean you have to raise your voice.

25
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:25,071
天气不好?我在这个岛的另外一边过了7个星期的糟糕日子,
Bad day? I've had seven weeks of bad days on the other side of the island,

26
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:28,021
只是努力活着 从而回到你的身边
just trying to stay alive so I could get back to you.

27
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,058
但是这却...
But here...

28
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:36,064
天哪 Rose 他们在沙滩上建了个厨房
my god, Rose,they've built a kitchen on the beach.

29
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:39,027
他们已经放弃了
They've given up.

30
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:42,021
放弃?放弃什么?
Given up? On what?

31
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:44,033
放弃离开这
On getting rescued.

32
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,083
你要处理下那个玩意儿吗?
You gonna get that?

33
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:46,031
你最后一次进去见他是什么时候
When's the last time you went in to see him?

34
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:48,074
几个小时前 他正在睡觉
Couple hours ago. He was sleeping.

35
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:52,054
-他吃了吗  -没有
-Did he eat  -Nope.

36
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:54,055
到现在已经两天了
That's two days now.

37
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:58,052
不吃不喝  什么都不说
No food. No water. Nothing to say.

38
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:03,015
我不知道你是怎么想的  我是等的不耐烦了
I don't know about you, but I'm tired of waiting.

39
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,066
我听说你没有什么胃口
I hear you've lost your appetite.

40
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,051
好样的 不说拉倒
OK. Don't talk.

41
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:31,092
我向来对和病人沟通就不擅长
I was never that good at bedside manner, anyway.

42
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,020
让我来给你肩膀的伤口换个药
I'm gonna change your dressing.

43
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,021
如果你想打什么主意的话 那你就有大麻烦了 所以 henry
If you try anything, we've got a problem. So, Henry...

44
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:55,060
Henry.

45
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:01,044
我正在想在我们调查清楚出 你到底是谁之前说些什么
I was thinking about something you were saying before we found out who you are.

46
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:04,047
这有点痛
This is gonna sting.

47
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:11,085
你一直说如果你是他们的其中一员的话
Yeah, you were saying that if you were one of them,

48
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,092
你就会把我们带进陷阱
that you'd lead us into a trap.

49
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:19,079
绑架我们的人 和我们做交易 用你做交易
Capture our people, force a trade. Us for you.

50
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:24,080
Henry 这真是个好主意
Pretty good idea, Henry.

51
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:29,067
既然你是他们中的其中一员 我想你现在最好充分利用时间
And since you are one of them, I thought now might be a good time to use it.

52
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:35,031
我打算越过那条不应该被越过的界线
I'm going out to the line that we're not supposed to cross

53
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:38,008
告诉他们你在我们手上
and telling them that we've got you.

54
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,092
如果他们想带你回去 那就得拿东西来换
And if they want you back, it's gonna cost 'em.

55
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,042
当我们把Walt换回来
And when we get Walt back...

56
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:53,042
那你惹的这些麻烦也算值了
you might just have been worth all the trouble.

57
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:00,006
那你惹的这些麻烦也算值了
Did you say something?

58
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,050
他们不会把walt还给你们的
They'll never give you Walt.

Don't gun it. You're digging yourself in.

62
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:42,084

-Just tap the gas, lightly.  -All due respect,

63
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,091
我都在雪地里开了一辈子车了 你介意我往后退一点吗
I have driven in snow my whole life. Mind stepping back?

64
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,092
你介意我往后退一点吗 你这样做不能
You have to rock it out. You're not gonna be able to...

65
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:57,029
-我打"AAA"吧  -为什么 难到这样他们就会送一个拖车过来
-I'm calling triple A.  -What, so they can send a tow truck?

66
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:59,046
相信我 我能搞定这一切
Trust me, I can do this.

67
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:07,057
好的 慢慢往上加一点油门
OK. Ease on the gas.

68
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:11,001
就是这样 你做得真棒

I had to beat back half the group to get these. I saved them for you.

86
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,084
这不行  我在减肥

87

97
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:11,079

Hey, Richard, Craig, Jerome, come here. I got a great idea...

98
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,037
我还是不确定他们到底愿不愿意换人
I'm not sure trading people's their thing.

99
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:19,077
与他谈话也没有什么用
talking to him is getting us nowhere.

100
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:22,060
所以 也许我们能给他想要的东西
So, maybe we can get something for him.

101
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:25,067
你要我和你一起去吗?
You want me to come with you?

所以 也许我们能给他想要的东西
You need to stay here.

103
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,082
你只要待在这就好
You need it more than I do.

104
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,019

What, that's like four in the last half hour?

109
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,074
让我去叫吉尼斯纪录吧
Let me call the Guinness book.

110
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:03,051
你到底帮不帮我   我还要用我的时间多做些事呢
You want help or not? 'Cause I've got better things to do with my time.

111
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:07,085
快乐的一天 我们的微笑医生过来了
happy day. Here comes Dr. Giggles.

112
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:12,019
嗨  一个人啊
Hey, yourself.

113
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:16,083
我要再回到丛林里找 那个长胡子的"老朋友"谈谈
I'm going back to the jungle to talk to our friend with the beard.

114
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,026
看看我们能不能和他做个交易
See if we can make a trade.

115
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,033
俘虏交换
the old prisoner exchange.

116
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:25,033
难道你要叫上我一起去  顺便拿到那些枪
You're inviting me along 'cause you want a gun?

117
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,087
我不是在邀请你  我是在邀请kate
I'm not inviting you, I'm inviting Kate.

118
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:31,054
我已经有一把抢了,不过谢谢帮助.
And I've already got a gun, but thanks for offering.

119
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,077
你他妈的是怎么弄到枪的
How in the hell did you get a gun?

120
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:35,087
这有意义吗
Does it matter?

121
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:41,032
我收拾下我的东西
I'll get my things.

122
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:48,092
好的 我们已经被困在这岛上两个月了吧
OK, two months we've been on this island. Two months.

123
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,016
现在我们已经有了储水罐 
And already we have a water trough,

124
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,029
也有了食物仓库
and we've got a food pantry,

125
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:59,003
所有人都能在那舱里洗澡
and people are taking showers in your hatch.

126
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:03,010
难道你们已经忘了我们 是落难到这岛上的吗
Have you forgotten that we all crashed on this island?

127
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:07,048
-现在好像没有人想回家  -你说什么  我们都想回家
-It's like none of you want to go home.  -How can you say that? Of course we do.

128
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:11,061
-那为什么我们不为此做点什么  -哥们 我们做过一个木筏
-Why aren't we doing anything about it?  -Dude, we like built a raft.

129
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,035
不过散架了
But, it got blown up.

130
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:18,032
好的 那么我们现在干吗
OK. So, what are we doing now?

131
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,049
那降落伞里面有那么多食物
That pallet of food had a parachute,

132
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:23,050
那降落伞里面有那么多食物
which means a plane dropped it here,

133
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:27,002
那也就意味着会有别的飞机经过这里
which means there are other planes that fly over the island.

134
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:32,077
所以我们要建造一个标志物 一个在沙滩上巨大的标志物
So, we are gonna build a sign, a massive sign along the beach.

135
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:38,024
那样的话 如果有飞机飞过这里 或者卫星拍照的时候
So, that way, if a plane flies over or a satellite takes pictures from up there

136
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:42,058
我们必须有十足的把握  别人知道我们在这该死的岛上
we wanna make damn sure that they know we're here,

137
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:44,034
让他们知道我们的存在
that they know about us.

138
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:48,041
也许我们应当先和jack说一下
Maybe we should speak to Jack about this first.

139
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:52,039
难道我们做什么事都要经过jack批准吗
do we have to run everything by Jack?

140
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:56,026
我的意思是他并不是我们的总统 他-他只是个医生
I mean, he's not the president. He's... He's a doctor.

141
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,032
而你只是个牙医
You're a dentist.

142
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:06,083
我能和你说上几分钟吗
Could I speak to you for just a second?

143
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,037
过来
Come here.

144
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:14,048
亲爱的 这支是个标志物 我看不出有什么不妥
Honey, it is just a sign. I don't see what the harm is.

145
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:18,075
问题是你说的那些飞机以及
The harm is you are telling these people about airplanes and satellites

146
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,091
不知从哪里冒出来的卫星
coming out of nowhere to save the day.

147
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:24,082
不知从哪里冒出来的卫星 我想回到属于我的生活中去
I'm just trying to do something. I want to get back to our life.

148
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:29,009
好样的 唯一不妥的就是 你正在给这里的人们一个错误的希望
Well, the only thing you are doing is giving these people false hope.

149
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:41,030
对不起
Excuse me.

150
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:43,040
我自己去造
I have a sign to build.

151
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:49,051
就这样吧 我希望马上就能开工
All right, I want to get this going right away.

152
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,057
我们已经等的太久了
We've waited long enough.

153
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,059
这简直太棒了 不是吗
It's just amazing, isn't it?

154
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,003
当然 它太漂亮了
sure, it's beautiful.

155
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:11,063
-感觉你有点心不在焉  -是的
-You're not impressed  -yeah.

156
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:16,070
那么 上帝要怎么做才能吸引你的注意呢
So, what does God have to do to get your attention?

157
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,087
Bernard  你在想什么
Bernard? What are you doing?

158
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:32,095
Rose...

159
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:37,003
我打了56年光棍了
I'd been a bachelor for 56 years.

160
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:43,087
直到我遇见你
And then I met you and we just fell into this rhythm,

161
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:46,057
就像...我们相遇就像上天安排好了似的
like we had known each other forever.

162
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:51,014
我总是梦想能找到像你这么好的人
I had always dreamed of finding somebody like you,

163
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,061
但是我不能再错过这样的机会
but I'd given up hope that I ever would.

164
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:56,048
-Bernard  -我知道 我知道 这太疯狂了
-Bernard...  -I know, I know. It's crazy.

165
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:59,072
我们才认识五个月
I mean, we just met five months ago.

166
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:04,048
但是五个月已经足够得久了  
But five months is long enough

167
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:09,048
因为我知道哪怕只有五分钟 我也会这么想
because I knew after five minutes.

168
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,033
Rose...

169
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,073
我爱你
I love you.

170
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:20,074
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

171
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,014
Bernard  我快要死了
Bernard, I'm dying.

172
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:36,045
我病的很重 快要死了
I'm sick, and I'm dying.

173
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:45,036
能让我们单独呆一会儿吗
Would you excuse us for a minute, please?

174
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:03,028
前几年我的病情一度好转了
I've been in remission for the last couple of years,

175
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:06,081
但是现在 它不仅回来了反而又加重了
but now it's back, and this time it's not going away.

176
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:12,003
我的医生告诉我 我只有一年时间
My doctor says I have about a year...

177
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:15,043
也许还能再长一点
maybe a little longer.

178
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:33,081
你还没有回答我的问题
You haven't answered my question.

179
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:38,051
你确定吗
Are you sure?

180
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:45,099
你确定吗
Oh, I'm sure.

181
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:54,097
我愿意
Yes.

182
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,034
我愿意
Yes.

183
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:08,098
怎么 你和我一起待了48天 现在你却不和我讲话
Well, you bunk with a guy for 48 days, now he doesn't call or write.

184
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,068
你好  Bernard
Hello, Bernard.

185
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:15,065
-你们两个在干什么  -工作
-What have you boys got going up here  -Just working.

186
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:21,016
这样 听好了 我组织了一群人 要在海滩上建一个巨大的标志物
I got a team of folks throwing together a big sign down along the beach.

187
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:24,006
希望能有飞机或是卫星发现我们
Hopefully it'll get us spotted by a plane or satellite.

188
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:27,019
我们确信我们要有足够的人手来帮忙
We could use all the bodies we can get to help put it together.

189
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,013
对不起 我很忙
Sorry, I'm busy.

190
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,074
-Charlie  -对不起 Bernard 
-Charlie  -Regrets, Bernard,

191
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:36,050
我只有两只手  但还是祝你好运
I've only got two hands, you know? Good luck, though.

192
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,054
好的 至少能给我几根大木头吗
Could I at least grab some of these logs?

193
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:43,098
-我们要用  -我们正在用它们
-We could sure use...  -We're using them.

194
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,085
-到底用来干嘛  -一座教堂
-For what, exactly  -A church.

195
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:52,006
-一座教堂  -是的
-A church  -Yes.

196
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,019
岛上的每一个人都在建些东西
Everybody on this island is building something.

197
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,032
我只是想让我们获救
I'm trying to get us saved.

198
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:02,073
bernard 每个人都有各自的方法
People are saved in different ways, Bernard.

199
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:08,066
我想我还是更喜欢 那个用木棒打自己同伴的你
I think I liked you better when you just hit people with your stick.

200
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:14,074
我还是喜欢现在的你
I like you just the way you are.

201
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:48,011
我要和他说话
I need to talk to him.

202
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:51,021
枪给jack了 门不能开
The gun's with Jack. The door stays closed.

203
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:56,012
但是如果你坚持要 就去说吧
But if you wanna talk to him, talk to him.

204
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:12,066
Henry 你能听见我说话吗
Henry, can you hear me?

205
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,030
是我John  Henry.
It's John, Henry.

206
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:29,015
Henry 你输入过那些数字吗
Henry, did you enter the numbers?

207
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:34,019
你到底有没有按按钮啊
Did you push the button or not?

208
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:40,036
Henry! 我要知道 我要你回答我
Henry! I need to know! I want you to answer me!

209
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,053
回答我
Answer me!

210
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,070
henry你能听见我说话吗
Answer me, you hear me?

211
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:03,092
大家都怎么了?
What happened to everybody?

212
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:06,065
嗯 craig在哪儿  frogurt去哪儿了
Where's Craig? Where's Frogurt?

213
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,089
好吧 好吧 咱们继续 我们要把标志物弄满整个沙滩
OK, all right, moving on. We're gonna put this sign across this entire beach.

214
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:18,020
也就是说字母必须足够大  40英尺左右
Which means the letters have to be really big, about 40 feet.

215
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:23,004
这些黑石头要尽可能的与这些沙子区分开来
These black rocks will get maximum contrast with the sand.

216
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,048
伙计 我们好像要更多的石头
Dude, we're gonna need a lot more rocks.

217
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:29,017
是的 hurley我们的确要更多的石头
Yes, Hurley, we are gonna need a lot more rocks.

218
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:33,002
内岛大概半英里有一片石灰岩
There's a lava field about half a mile inland that's loaded with them.

219
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:35,005
我们要把它们搬过来 我们要分成两人一组
We'll haul them out in two-man teams.

220
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:37,002
所以你们两个一组
So, you guys double up,

221
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:41,079
我在沙滩上做字母的图形 我们开工吧
and I am gonna start sketching out the letters in the sand. Let's do this.

222
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,033
嗨 我可以做字母的图形
Hey, I can sketch the letters.

223
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,073
每一个人都有工作 hurley. 我做我的 你做你的
Everybody's got a job, Hurley. I do my job, you do yours.

224
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:53,050
什么 他在说什么
What? What did he say?

225
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:56,067
我想他对整个关于从半英里外的地方 运石头过来并不感到疯狂
I think he's not so crazy about the whole carry-the-rocks-a-half-mile thing.

226
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:59,044
好吧  嗯 这需要时间
OK. Look, this is gonna take time,

227
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:04,042
但是只有这样才能让我们离开这个地方 这不值得吗
but if this is the thing that gets us off this place, isn't that worth it?

228
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:06,082
你知道的 罗马也不是一天建成的
Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.

229
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:11,005
啊 不 你不知道...好了我们开始吧 加油干
No, you don't know. OK, all right, let's get started. Come on.

230
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:16,096
我们迷路了
We're lost.

231
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:19,069
甜心 这可不是你说迷路就迷路哦
You saying we're lost doesn't make us lost.

232
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:21,089
我知道我们在哪儿
I know exactly where we are.

233
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:23,066
我也是
Me, too.

234
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:27,007
我知道我们在澳洲内陆原地打转呢
Driving around in circles in the middle of the outback.

235
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:31,057
那就是为什么我想去海边度蜜月了
That's why I wanted to be on a beach for our honeymoon.

236
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,051
谢天谢地 文明世界
Thank goodness, civilization.

237
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:39,008
Bernard 我们去明确一下方向
Bernard, let's get directions.

238
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:41,031
哦 我不需要方向
Oh, I don't need directions.

239
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,032
我告诉过你 亲爱的 我们没有迷路
I told you, honey, we're not lost.

240
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,089
Bernard 怎么了
Bernard, what's going on?

241
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:53,079
我带你来这里 是因为我要你来见一个人
I brought you out here because I want you to see this man.

242
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:59,083
他叫 isaac of uluru  他已经帮助了成百上千的人
His name is Isaac of Uluru, and he's helped hundreds of people.

243
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:04,037
现在 我知道这看上去怎样  但是请相信我 他完全信得过
Now, I know how it looks but, believe me, he is completely legit.

244
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:09,041
Bernard 你带我来做信仰治疗
Bernard, you brought me to a faith healer?

245
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:17,076
他真的可以帮上忙 rose
He's the real deal, Rose.

246
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,055
曾经我告诉别人你的情况
Once I started telling people about your situation,

247
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:22,053
接到到三个不同的电话都向我推荐他
I got three calls recommending him.

248
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,076
我的情况
My "situation"?

249
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,016
这就是为什么要我来澳大利亚的原因
This is why you wanted to come to Australia?

250
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:33,026
-带我来看一个怪人  -不 他不是怪人
-To bring me to some kind of a kook?  -No, he's not.

251
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:36,043
Rose 我捐了 $10,000 只是为了带你来见他
I made a $10,000 donation just to get you in to see him.

252
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:39,045
-基本看来  -我不需要
-Normally...  -I didn't ask for this!

253
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,085
这只是
This is...

254
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:56,003
Bernard...

255
00:20:57,013 --> 00:21:01,016
我可以平静得面对发生在我身上的一切
I have made my peace with what's happening to me.

256
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:07,033
但是我不能
I haven't.

257
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:11,027
rose 我不能什么也不做
I can't just do nothing, Rose.

258
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:15,015
这不是我 这不是真实的我
That's not me. That's not who I am.

259
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:18,042
我得去尝试
I have to try.

260
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:23,031
rose 你愿意尝试吗
Will you try, Rose?

261
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,085
为了我
For me.

262
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:37,060
好的 这很棒 这真是个巨大的标志物
It's gonna be great. A really big sign.

263
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:39,007
太棒了
That's great.

264
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:42,080
如果你有时间来修你的房子  你就有时间来搬那些石头
If you have time to fix your hut, you have time to move some rocks.

265
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,094
我们需要你的帮忙
Come on, we could really use your help.

266
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:49,091
你在联合他们建沙场遇到了麻烦 对吗
What? You got union trouble down at the sand factory, Norma Rae?

267
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:54,088
来吧 sawyer 我需要你的帮忙
Come on, Sawyer. I need your help.

268
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:57,025
你说呢  没门
Now, what do you say?

269
00:21:57,032 --> 00:22:00,082
我说
I say... Pasadena.

270
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:18,074
-我希望你能开心  -关于什么
-Well, I hope you're happy.  -About what?

271
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:22,087
早上我还有15个人愿意一起造那个标志物 但是现在就只剩4个了
This morning I had 15 people willing to work on the sign. Now I'm down to four.

272
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:25,014
是我的过错吗
And how is that my fault?

273
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:28,019
至少我希望得到你的支持
At the very least, I expected your support.

274
00:22:28,026 --> 00:22:30,002
但是你却公然反对我
You had to go and attack me.

275
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:33,079
你还停下来好好想过  那些人退出的原因
Have you ever stopped to think, maybe the reason people are quitting

276
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:37,043
是你的管理方法上出了问题
is because you've got yourself a management problem?

277
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:42,047
rose 你到底是怎么了
What is the matter with you, Rose?

278
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:44,037
我只是想试着做些什么
I am just trying to do something.

279
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:46,093
那就对了 你总是在尝试做着什么
That's right. You're always trying to do.

280
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:49,067
为什么你不能任其自然呢
Why can't you just let things be?

281
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:55,041
如果我没有努力尝试 你就不会在这
If I didn't always have to do something, you wouldn't be here.

282
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,034
我很荣幸
I'm flattered.

283
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,097
嗯? 为什么
Yeah? Why is that?

284
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:29,014
因为你选择我和你一起去而不是sawyer
Because you chose me to go with you instead of Sawyer.

285
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:32,088
我先问的sayid 但是  他拒绝了我
I asked Sayid first, but he turned me down.

286
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:38,012
我只有问你 因为 他们 不需要你
And I only asked you because they don't want you.

287
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,022
他们抓住你不放 用枪威胁你
They grabbed you, had you at gunpoint.

288
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:43,066
他们本可以抓走你 但却没有
They coulda kept you, but they didn't.

289
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:46,096
话说回来 他们也不需要我
Then again, they didn't really want me either.

290
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:50,099
损坏的货物  我们两个
Damaged goods... both of us.

291
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:06,017
那是什么
What's that?

292
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,072
Kate...

293
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,016
-是个玩具  -等等 等等 不
-It's a doll.  -Wait, don't!

294
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,085
别 别
Don't! Don't!

295
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:28,057
对不起
Sorry.

296
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,022
-你还好吗  -是的
-You OK?  -Yeah.

297
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,028
还好能听见我讲话
good, so you can hear me.

298
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:46,045
这不会是他们设置的一个陷阱吧
This isn't one of theirs.

299
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:49,009
不 这还不够老练
No, it's not sophisticated enough.

300
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:53,053
一定是rousseau做的其中一个陷阱 希望她离这不是很远
Must be one of Rousseau's traps. Hopefully she's not far from here.

301
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,019
也许她一个星期后才出现
Could be a week before she shows up.

302
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,026
-你在干什么  -我正试着那我的枪
-What are you doing?  -I'm trying to get the gun.

303
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:05,054
-我的手翻不过来  -好的 这 我来
-I can't get my arm around.  -All right, here, let me...

304
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:06,091
好的
All right.

305
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:14,032
对不起  我可不想对你开枪
Sorry, I don't want to shoot you.

306
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:17,018
好的
OK.

307
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:18,052
你拿到了吗
You got it?

308
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,022
-好的 准备好了吗  -是的
-OK, ready?  -Yeah.

309
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:22,042
拿到了 拿到了 拿到了
Got it! Got it, got it, got it!

310
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:26,056
-这 拿到了  -现在把枪给我
-Got it.  -All right. Now, give me the gun.

311
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:29,093
-为什么  -试着射那个结
-Why? What for?  -I'm gonna try to shoot the rope.

312
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:36,031
我的枪法比你准
I'm a better shot than you.

313
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:37,054
真的吗
Oh, really?

314
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:40,070
当然 我告诉过你  我从小和我父亲一起打猎
Yeah. I told you, I grew up hunting with my dad.

315
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,075
该死的
Damn it!

316
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:52,012
好样的 至少他们知道我们在哪里了 好的 现在把枪给我
at least they know where we are. OK, now, give me the gun.

317
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:55,009
-难道你还要再浪费一颗子弹吗  -别担心
-Are you gonna waste another bullet?  -Don't worry.

318
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:58,010
我们还有13颗可以互相射击的子弹 加油
We'll still have 13 more to shoot each other with. Come on.

319
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,040
好的  反正你的角度比我的好
Fine. You have a better angle than I anyway.

320
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:04,033
如果我射中了你就把这当作借口吧
that's gonna be your excuse when I make the shot?

321
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,057
如果你打中的话
When you make the shot.

322
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,091
好的
OK.

323
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,085
好枪法
Nice shot.

324
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:30,055
不!不!不!不!不!不!
No! No-no-no-no-no!

325
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:32,050
全做错了
You're doing it all wrong!

326
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,076
我告诉过你排成三行
I told you, three rows!

327
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,047
三行 那样你才可以从天上看见它
Three, so they can see it from the air!

328
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:43,064
三行 那又有多难
Three rows. How hard is that?

329
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:50,021
难道什么都要我自己做吗
Do I have to do everything myself?

330
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:56,055
不! 不!不!不! 不!jin 不!等等
No. No-no-no! No, Jin! No, wait.

331
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:58,092
求求你
Please.

332
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:03,042
我只是想带我妻子回家
I just want to get my wife home.

333
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,040
Rose.

334
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:11,016
我想带Rose回家
I want to get Rose home.

335
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:17,068
对不起
Sorry.

336
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:37,002
你在我的地盘上
You're in my spot.

337
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,033
我可以走
I can move.

338
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:46,064
-你可以吗  -噢 那很有趣
-Can you?  -Oh, that's funny.

339
00:27:48,044 --> 00:27:52,090
我猜你的幽默感和你腿一起被困在门里面了
I guess your sense of humor got trapped under that door with your leg.

340
00:27:56,055 --> 00:28:00,058
我看见你丈夫走进丛林了 搬石头
I saw your husband walking through the jungle, hauling rocks.

341
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:07,092
他正在在沙滩上建一个巨大的标志物 那样卫星可以看见它
He's building a big sign in the sand, so the satellites will see it.

342
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:14,046
他还不能区分什么是徒劳无功
That man doesn't know the difference between an errand and a fool's errand.

343
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,067
这样 rose 我们中绝大多数都不能
Well, Rose, most of us don't.

344
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:23,013
那么你来这下面干什么 john
So, what are you doing down here, John?

345
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:26,065
我都不记得上一次你走出舱门是什么时候的事
Can't remember the last time I saw you out of that hatch.

346
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:31,004
我受不了那个舱了
I'm done with the hatch.

347
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:34,002
你现在只是心情比较沮丧
now, you're just frustrated.

348
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:39,096
你很快就能丢掉那个夹板在岛上到处跑了
You'll be out of that splint and running around the island again in no time.

349
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:43,029
jack说这至少得用上4个星期
And yet, Jack said it'd be at least four weeks.

350
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:48,053
但是 亲爱的 你和我都知道 其实并没那么久
But, honey, you and I both know it's not gonna take that long.

351
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:08,085
这边走 Rose
Right this way, Rose.

352
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,021
你就是Rose
You must be Rose.

353
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:46,058
为什么不坐呢
Why don't you have a seat?

354
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:54,012
那么 要怎么做
So, how does this work?

355
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,053
我坐在这 你唱赞歌吗或者祈祷或是其他什么
I sit here and you chant or pray or what?

356
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:04,017
在地球上某个地方有着很巨大的能量
There are certain places with great energy,

357
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:08,004
就像现在我们所在的地方一样
spots on the Earth like the one we're above now.

358
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:12,057
可能是地质能量 磁能
Perhaps this energy is geological, magnetic...

359
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:16,085
或是其他什么
or perhaps it's something else.

360
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:19,072
在适当的时候
And, when possible,

361
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:24,016
我接收这些能量把它给别人
I harness this energy and give it to others.

362
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,046
我可以吗
May I?

363
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,081
什么
What...

364
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:51,048
怎么了
What... What is it?

365
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:55,052
对不起
I'm sorry.

366
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,056
我不能帮你 Rose
I can't do anything for you, Rose.

367
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:06,053
我本来也不指望
I didn't expect you to.

368
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:16,011
并不是说你不能被治愈
It's not that you can't be healed.

369
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:20,098
就像我说的  有不同的能量
Like I said...there's different energies.

370
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:24,025
对你而言 这不是正确的地方
This is not the right place for you.

371
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,059
哪里才是正确的地方
Where is the right place?

372
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:31,062
我希望我知道
I wish I knew.

373
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:36,056
-我将把你丈夫的募捐还给他  -不要这样
-I'll return your husband's donation...  -Don't.

374
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:41,080
我告诉他你治好了我
I'm gonna tell him you fixed me.

375
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:50,095
我告诉他你治好了我
I'm going to tell him you fixed me.

376
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:07,062
你刚才说的是什么意思
What did you mean back there?

377
00:32:08,063 --> 00:32:11,033
-什么  -在网子里
-What?  -In the net.

378
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,017
你说他们很老练
You said they were sophisticated, the Others.

379
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:23,071
上个星期小孩病了 Claire 和我走进丛林 
Last week when the baby got sick, Claire and I went into the jungle,

380
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:25,088
却发现了另一个舱
and found another hatch.

381
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:29,072
-什么  -像一个医疗站
-What?  -Like a medical station.

382
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:33,069
没有你要用的东西 全部都清空了 但是
There was nothing you could use, it was all cleared out. But...

383
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:38,066
我发现了一些橱柜  它们里面都是些破的和脏的衣服
I found some lockers. They had clothes inside, all worn and dirty,

384
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:42,017
衣服都是挂着的  像就像演出的衣服 你知道吧
but they were on hangers, like costumes, you know?

385
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:45,000
还有化妆箱
And there was a makeup kit...

386
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,074
和假须
and a fake beard.

387
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:52,004
你打算什么时候告诉我这些
When were you gonna tell me this?

388
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,057
当你决定让我回到舱里的时候
When you decided to let me back in the club.

389
00:32:58,035 --> 00:32:59,091
什么
What?

390
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:04,051
你可以把其中一个锁在舱里 一个星期 却什么都没说
You can keep one of them locked up in the hatch for a week and say nothing,

391
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:06,058
但那时 当我
but then when I...

392
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,089
我们到了
We're here.

393
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:13,060
你确定? 我
Are you sure? I...

394
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:16,026
那就是他们向sawyer射击的地方
That's where they took the shot at Sawyer.

395
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:21,083
在那里 那里就是他们把 套着包的你从草丛里推出来的地方
Over there is where they pushed you out of the jungle with a bag on your head.

396
00:33:21,091 --> 00:33:24,010
这就是
And right there is where I...

397
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:27,017
我放下枪的地方
where I laid my guns down.

398
00:33:37,052 --> 00:33:39,015
我回来了
Hey, I'm back!

399
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,062
你说你正监视着我们
You say you're watching us?

400
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:46,052
听见我的话了吗
You hear me?

401
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,053
我们手里有你们的人
We've got your man.

402
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,003
如果你要他回去 你们就快点出来
You want him back, you're gonna have to come out here.

403
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:57,051
快出来
Come on out!

404
00:33:57,058 --> 00:33:59,020
-Jack  -我知道你们在那儿
-Jack!  -I know you're there!

405
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:03,004
-我知道你们能听见我讲话  -Jack 他们不在这
-I know you can hear me.  -Jack, they're not here.

406
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:06,031
我就在这里不走知道你出来和我对话
I'll be right here until you talk to me.

407
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,011
我就在这里
I'll be right here.

408
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:31,007
我给你带来了点晚餐
I brought you some supper.

409
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:34,048
谢谢 你只要把它放在那里就好
Thanks. You can just set it down there.

410
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:42,082
他们人呢
Where is everybody?

411
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,070
我欠你一个道歉
I owe you an apology.

412
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:55,043
你没有什么要和我道歉的 这只是我自己该死的错误 让我自己待在这里
You don't have anything to be sorry for. It's my fault I'm here by myself.

413
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,087
我不是为了那个向你道歉
That's not why I'm apologizing.

414
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:02,090
我对你说谎了
I lied to you.

415
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:09,030
在澳大利亚  Isaac  他没能治好我
Back in Australia... Isaac, he didn't heal me.

416
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:13,011
他什么也没做
He didn't do anything.

417
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:21,039
-他当然做了...你...  -Bernard  他没能治好我
-Of course he did. You're...  -Bernard, he didn't heal me.

418
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:25,089
但是这并不意味着我没有好
But that doesn't mean I'm not healed.

419
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:31,097
当你生病的时候
When you're sick

420
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:35,044
你可以感觉到原本在身上并没有的东西  
and you have something inside you that doesn't belong there,

421
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,053
你可以感觉到它
you can feel it.

422
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:42,098
坠机之后 我在也感觉不到了
And after the crash... I couldn't feel it anymore.

423
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:47,038
起初 我以为我被撞晕了
At first I thought it was just shock...

424
00:35:50,076 --> 00:35:52,082
但那不是
but it wasn't.

425
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:57,073
就是这个地方
It's this place.

426
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:02,073
但是--但是你说isaac治好了你
But you said Isaac fixed you.

427
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,056
我那样说
I told you that,

428
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:10,044
是不想让你 再浪费剩下来的时间 我们要留下来一起做一些事情
so that you wouldn't spend what time we had left trying to do something.

429
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:18,058
Rose 可能只是略微好了一点
Rose, you could just be in remission.

430
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:21,009
你怎么知道不是isaac治好了你
How do you know it wasn't Isaac who healed you?

431
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:23,085
-你怎么知道他没有治好你  -我知道
-How do you know he didn't heal you?  -I know.

432
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:28,088
我知道
I know.

433
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:45,077
是你的吗
These yours?

434
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:48,044
是的 谢谢
Thank you.

435
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,065
不客气
You're welcome.

436
00:36:57,086 --> 00:36:59,085
相信我
Trust me.

437
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:03,015
我知道
I know.

438
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:13,030
你不想被救离这里 是不是
You don't want to be rescued, do you?

439
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:20,011
你是觉得如果你离开这 它又会回来
You think if you leave, it'll come back.

440
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:26,048
如果你不想离开
And if you can't leave...

441
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:31,075
我也不离开
neither can I.

442
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,082
我们永远也不离开这 Rose
We won't ever leave, Rose.

443
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,094
我愿意
I would...

444
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:59,038
我会把这些标记拆掉 但是  反正我们开始没多久
I would offer to take down the sign, but we didn't get very far.

445
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,055
是我按的按钮
I pressed your button.

446
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:38,095
按钮不是我的
It's not my button.

447
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:44,023
你去了哪里
Where did you go?

448
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:50,067
我只是需要 伸展一下我的双腿
I just needed to... stretch my legs.

449
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,063
jack 你还要等多久
How long are you gonna wait, Jack?

450
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:04,063
直到得到回音
Until I get my voice back.

451
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,097
我还会再喊几声
And then I'm gonna yell some more.

452
00:41:12,024 --> 00:41:14,021
可能他们根本就没听见
Maybe they can't hear you.

453
00:41:15,095 --> 00:41:17,094
他们一定听得见
They can hear me.

454
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,075
对不起 我吻了你
I'm sorry I kissed you.

455
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:38,040
没什么大不了的
I'm not.

456
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:22,011
Michael!

457
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:40,050
