-我们得发射闪光弹  -这毫无道理...
-We have to fire the flare.  -It doesn't make...

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:19,005
听着  你到底是把枪给我
Look, are you gonna give me the damn gun,

7
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:23,044
还是逼我去抢?
or am I gonna have to take it?

8
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:27,035
我的天啊
Please, God!

9
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:31,050
回来了  回来了
It's coming back! It's coming back!

10
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:36,068
我们得把那个男孩带走
We're gonna have to take the boy.

11
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:38,072
什么?  你说什么?
What? What did you say?

12
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:44,058
那个男孩  我们得带走他
The boy. We're gonna have to take him.

13
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:46,094
嘿  爸爸
Hey! Hey! What...Dad!

14
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:51,007
-爸爸  -不
-Dad!  -No!

15
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,026
爸爸  救我
Dad! Help me!

16
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:58,051
-Walt  -救我  爸爸
-Walt!  -Help me, Dad!

17
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,063
不  不  不
No, no, no...

18
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:06,076
停下
Stop it!

19
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:10,088
停下  我们不能这么做
Stop it! We can't!

20
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:18,052
Locke发现了一个...
Locke found a...

21
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:21,052
在地下发现了一个舱门
a hatch in the ground.

22
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,086
太阳在3小时内就会升起
The sun comes up in three hours

23
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:25,040
我们一定会在这里看见那一刻的
and we're all gonna see that happen.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,070
我们大家今晚一起呆在这儿  好么?
We're gonna stay here tonight, OK?Together.

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,067
-John  你在干什么?  -我要下去
-John, what are you doing?  -I'm going in.

26
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:36,020
不管你反不反对  Locke还是准备下到那里面去
Locke's going into that thing,whether you like it or not.

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,057
我要下到舱门里去
I'm going to the hatch.

28
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,005
一起生  单独死  对么?
Live together, die alone, right?

29
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:42,050
是的
Right.

30
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:55,056
John  我想下面好像有东西
John! I think there's something down here!

31
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:11,099
爸爸  救我  爸爸
Dad, please! Dad!

32
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:18,062
Walt  Walt

Mike

41

迷 失
第二季 第二集

54
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:53,086
-Walt在哪儿?  -我不知道
-Where's Walt?  -I don't know.

55
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,053
-他在哪儿?  -我不知道
-Where is he?  -I don't know!

56
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:59,035
我儿子到底在哪儿?
Where the hell is my son?

57
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:03,019
Walt

58
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:10,003
你怎么伤到腿的?
How'd you hurt your leg?

59
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:13,032
被一辆车撞了
Got hit by a car.

60
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,090
恩
Yeah.

61
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,082
那么这是你前妻发来的文件
So, this is the paperwork your ex-wife sent over...

62
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:21,008
她不是我的前妻  她是...
She's not my ex-wife, man.

63
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:23,076
她只是Walt的母亲
She's just Walt's mother.

64
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:24,083
她  呃...
She...

65
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,098
Susan...她刚刚和她的男朋友在罗马找到工作
Susan, she just got a job in Rome with her boyfriend.

66
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,059
他们想让Walt跟他们在一起
They want to take Walt with them.

67
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,093
别担心  我会尽力帮助你的  Dylan先生
Don't worry, I'm gonna take real good care of you, Mr Dylan.

68
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:35,001
是Dawson
Dawson.

69
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,018
哦  是的  对不起  Dawson
Right. Sorry. Dawson.

70
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:41,069
那么她的男朋友...是叫Brian Porter么?
So this boyfriend,this is this guy Brian Porter?

71
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,008
是的  怎么了?  上面写了什么?
Yeah. Why? What's it say?

72
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,031
看起来好像Susan
It seems that Susan

73
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:49,031
想让你放弃作为Walt的父亲的权力
wants you to relinquish your rights as Walt's father

74
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,081
这样Porter先生就能领养他了
so that Mr Porter can adopt him.

75
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:53,067
她想让我放弃孩子?
She wants me to sign my son away?

76
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:56,091
是的  这是他们想领养你的孩子的唯一途径
It's the only way they can proceed with the adoption, yeah.

77
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:59,093
听着  如果你签了这个文件  从法律上来说
Listen, if you sign this document, legally

78
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:02,067
他对你来说就和在街上遇到的其它孩子没什么区别了
he'll be no different than any other kid you pass on the street.

79
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:07,008
你等于放弃了你所有作为父亲的权力
You'd be giving up your paternal rights.All of them.

80
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:09,061
那么我能阻止她离开么?
So then, can I stop her from going?

81
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:11,088
我想我们能申请一个禁令
Well,I guess we could file an injunction

82
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:13,056
那么她就不能离开这座城市了 但是...
so she couldn't leave the city,but...

83
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:16,017
对  好的
Yeah, that. That.

84
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:17,085
我就要那么做
I want to do that.

85
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,044
好的
Right.

86
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:23,058
Dawson先生
Mr Dawson,

87
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:26,067
你这么辛苦得赶来让我知道了
the fact that you came in through these doors tells me something.

88
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:32,008
我是你能负担得起的最好的律师
It tells me that I'm the best that you can afford.

89
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,011
如果我们继续这件事的话
If we go forward with this,

90
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,090
那么就会很耗钱...很多很多钱
it's gonna take money a... lot of it.

91
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,088
即使是在我这样的价位上
Even at my rates.

92
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:43,099
现在我们处在弱势  所以我得问你
This is David and Goliath,so I gotta ask you,

93
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:47,073
你真得想要这么做么?
are you sure you wanna do this?

94
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:52,022
他们不能带走我的儿子
They're not taking my son away.

95
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:54,025
Walt

96
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:57,066
Walt

97
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,020
Walt

98
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,036
Mike  你省点力吧
Mike! You should save your energy.

99
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:02,071
他们带走了我的儿子
They took my son!

100
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:04,054
是的  我看见了...上了一艘船
Yeah, I saw. Onto a boat,

101
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:06,015
这就意味着任你怎么叫他也听不到
which means he's not in shouting distance!

102
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,071
-你不会知道的  -我能感知到
-You don't know that!  -I got a good sense.

103
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,057
并且即使他听见了  你又能怎么办呢?
Even if he was,there's nothing you can do.

104
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,009
听着  如果他能听见我叫
If he can hear me,

105
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,066
他就知道我还活着
he knows I'm alive,

106
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,069
而且我一定会去找他
that I'm coming for him,

107
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,012
并且把他救回来
that I'm going to get him back!

108
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:20,050
现在我唯一的希望就是他能听见我喊他
Right now, all I got is that maybe my son can hear me...

109
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,038
这和你有关系么?
Does that make any sense to you?

110
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:32,075
Walt

111
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:37,007
Walt

112
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,059
Kate

113
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:18,021
Kate

114
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:19,013
John

115
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:21,038
放松  没事  没事的
Easy, easy, easy.

116
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:25,040
你后面
Behind you.

117
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:31,029
你是他么?
Are you him?

118
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:36,006
你是他么?
Are you him?

119
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:41,005
Jin

120
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,064
Jin

121
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:45,068
Jin

122
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:49,070
我们省点力吧
I thought we had to save our energy.

123
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,039
噢  呃...Jin还在水中
Yeah, well,Jin's still out there in the water,

124
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,064
如果不影响你  我打算再叫一会儿
so if it's OK by you I'm gonna keep shoutin' awhile.

125
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:00,029
Jin

126
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,038
心虚了么?
Feeling guilty?

127
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:04,080
什么?
What?

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,005
是你叫我发射闪光弹的
You made me fire that flare.

129
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:11,077
是我叫你发射...
I made you fire...

130
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,084
什么  这是我的错么?
What, this is my fault?

131
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:15,078
他们带走了我的儿子
They took my son.

132
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,058
他们找到了我们  带走了Walt
They found us, took Walt,

133
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:19,076
全都是因为你叫我发射了闪光弹
because you made me fire the flare.

134
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,053
至少Walt还在一艘船上
Well, at least Walt is on a boat.

135
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,087
可能还裹着毯子喝着可可
Probably wrapped in a blanket with a cup of cocoa

136
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:26,051
-而我们只是在...  -离开我的筏子
-while we're on...  -Get off my raft.

137
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:29,066
-什么?  -离...
-What?  -Get...

138
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:34,031
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

139
00:10:57,017 --> 00:11:01,001
你还紧握着你最好的伙伴啊
I see you managed to hold on to your best friend, there.

140
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,085
它不会有用了
Thing ain't gonna work anyway.

141
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:04,079
-它会有用的  -你落过水
-It'll work.  -You were underwater.

142
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,074
你对枪有多了解  笨蛋?
What do you know about guns anyway,Hoss?

143
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:11,093
它还能用
It'll work.

144
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,033
如果子弹是干的  那火药也是干的
If the bullets are dry,the powder's dry.

145
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:20,001
如果火药是...
If the powder's...

146
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:26,054
哦天...那到底是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that?

147
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:30,069
是鲨鱼
It's a shark.

148
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:34,033
只是一只鲨鱼
It's only a shark.

149
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,080
"只是一只鲨鱼"?
"It's only a shark"?

150
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,002
是为了让我好过点么?
That's supposed to make me feel better?

151
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:40,064
呃  我想我知道为什么鲨鱼游到这儿来了
Well, I guess I know why the shark is hanging around.

152
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:42,028
你的肩膀

153
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:46,018
哦  好  那我马上去止血
Oh, well, I'll just stop bleeding then.

154
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:49,030
你突然好像什么都忘了
You suddenly forget what happened?

155
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,055
-我为什么会被击伤?  -什么?
-Why I got shot?  -What?

156
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:54,047
我是说  你连一点感激都没有么?
How about a little gratitude here?

157
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,051
我是说  你说句谢谢行不?
I mean, how about "Thank you"?

158
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,074
谢谢?  为了什么?
Thank you? For what?

159
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:04,069
是为了你想救自己?
For you trying to save your own ass?

160
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:08,068
你要我离开这个筏子?
You want me off this raft?

161
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:13,026
好吧
You got it!

162
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:50,047
我是为了要救你的孩子

大概一年前吧
About a year ago.

167

实际上是14个月

168
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:09,032
-这是一个问题么?  -为什么  Dawson先生?
-Is that a question, Lizzy?  -Why is that, Mr Dawson?

169
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:11,015
为什么这么长时间没见孩子?
Why so long?

170
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:14,019
Susan因工作原因把他带去了阿姆斯特丹

171
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:16,018
你对这件事没有意见是么?

172
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:17,011
你说什么?
Excuse me?

173
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:20,075
因为现在她要去罗马但你又要申请禁令
Well, since she's now going to Rome and you're filing an injunction,

174
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,096
看起来和以前的有点矛盾
it just seems a little inconsistent.

175
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:25,014
矛盾...不
Incon... No.

176
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,000
-不  不  不  -她在引诱你

你说过我无能为力的
You said there was nothing I could do.

180
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:32,040
然后你就什么也没做  是么?  
And you didn't, did you?

181
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
他不会回答这个问题的
He's not gonna answer that.

182
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,001
那是因为他回答不出
Because there is no answer.

183
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:41,092
你最近是不是刚遭遇了车祸?

是谁付的钱  Dawson先生?
Who paid for all that, Mr Dawson?

189
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,052
我并没有向你要过什么
I didn't ask you for anything.

190
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:57,023
这是不是能说明Dawson先生承认 
Could the record reflect Mr Dawson acknowledged

191
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:58,023
Lloyd小姐帮他付了这些钱?
Miss Lloyd paid his bills?

192

Susan  告诉他们我并没有向你要过什么

00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,051
你是不是太不了解你的孩子了  Dawson先生
you don't seem to know much about your son, Mr Dawson.

203
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,052

00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:43,098
抱歉  能说得响点么  是说给记录员听的
I'm sorry, could you say that louder,please?  Just for the record

205
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:48,027
我是他的父亲
I'm his father.

206
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:01,083
你疯了么?

你想徒手取出子弹么?

你一个人是做不到的

我想我们已经分道扬镳了  Mike
I thought we parted ways.Mike

212
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:21,013
我们都被困在同样的洋流上
We're caught in the same current.

213
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:25,039
你还要说什么?

我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

221

228
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,012
把刀放下
Get rid of the knife.

229
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:22,042
你不是他
You're not him!

230
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,048
我们不是来伤害你的

怎么说?
How's that, brother?

243
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:30,073
绑我是毫无意义的  我不是危险人物
It's pointless to tie me up,I'm not dangerous.

But her? She's a fugitive.

那你说的那些
What about all that stuff you said

258
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:34,030
等着看日出的话是怎么回事?
about waiting until morning and watching the sun rise?

259
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,082
我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

260
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:44,011
你想是怎么回事?
What do you suppose all that's about?

261

我猜Jack要做一些豪情壮举了
I reckon Jack's going to do something heroic.

262

怎么了?
What?

263
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,027
你总是以故意说笑来掩饰
You always try to be funny

264
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:54,027
当你不想回答一个问题的时候
when you don't want to answer a question.

265
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:58,062
"故意"说笑?
"Try" to be funny?

266
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:04,052
这是什么?
What's this?

267
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:09,046
噢  在丛林里找到的
I found it in the jungle.

268
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:12,013
-你找到的?     -是的
-You found it?    -Yeah.

269

272
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:23,018
你得小心点  你知道  这是圣母玛利亚
You gotta be careful with it, you know,it's the Virgin Mary.

273
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:24,050
她是很神圣的
She's holy.

274
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,016
倒没发现你居然是这么虔诚的信徒
I didn't realise you were so religious.

275
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:31,088
我不是  这只是...你知道
I'm not. It's just, you know,

276
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:34,044
它迟早会派上用场的
it might come in handy.

277
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:39,013
带在身上是不错的东西
Be a nice thing to have around.

278
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:50,073
那不是因为闪光弹
It wasn't the flare.

279
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:57,030
我说了  那不是因为闪光弹
I said it wasn't the flare.

280
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,077
那些人这么做...
Those people that did this...

281
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:06,096
起先我以为他们是渔民或是海盗什么的
At first I thought they were fishermen or pirates or something.

282
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:09,085
然后我仔细看了他们的船
Then I got a good look at their boat.

283
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:13,088
你了解船么  Mike?
You know anything about boats, Mike?

284
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:16,074
那种船不是用来在大洋上开的
Boat like that wasn't built for the open ocean.

285
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,069
一点小风小浪就能让船进水
Water's coming over the side the first little squall.

286
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:23,065
航程可能也就一百多里吧
Maybe got a range of a hundred miles.

287
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:28,065
不  像那样的船应该是在一个很近的码头驶出的
Nope. A boat like that had to have left port from somewhere close.

288
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:31,096
比如说那个岛
Like the island.

289
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:36,047
法国女人说"其他人"是冲着孩子来的
French chick said the Others were coming for the kid.

290
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:40,000
我认为他们来了  Mike
I think they came, Mike.

291
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,067
-什么?    -他是他们想要的人
-What?    -He's the one they wanted,

292
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,079
我肩膀为什么会中弹
why I got a bullet in my shoulder.

293
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,038
那些人炸飞了我们就是因为他们想要你的孩子
Bluebeard blew us up because they wanted your kid.

294
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:51,044
-你是说这都是我的错?    -是的  这就是我要说的
-You saying this is my fault?    -Yeah. That's what I'm sayin'.

295
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,037
-他们是因为你才带走我的孩子的    -我们
-They took him because of you.   -We

296
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:54,049
他们当时已经驶远了
They were sailing away!

297
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,057
他们找到我们是因为他们在找我们  在找Walt
They found us because they were looking for us! For Walt!

298
00:21:57,057 --> 00:21:59,091
你不许再叫他的名字  不许
Don't ever say his name again, ever!

299
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:04,077
你能怎么样  用水泼我?
What you gonna do? Splash me?

300
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:50,088
-听着  我知道...   -闭嘴
-Look. I know...    -Shut up!

301
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:53,024
别说了
Don't even...

302
00:22:53,024 --> 00:23:01,087
你根本不知道怎么关心别人
You have no idea what it's like to care for somebody else.

303
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:19,042
你的律师呢?
Where are your lawyers?

304
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:23,022
我跟他们说了  我想和你单独谈谈
I told them I wanted to talk.Just you and me.

305
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:25,018
但如果你想让你的律师来  我能理解
But if you want yours, I understand.

306
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:30,017
不  不用了
No. It's OK.

307
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:39,044
我想你会赢
I think you're gonna win.

308
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:42,087
-什么?  -在法庭上
-Excuse me?  -In court.

309
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:47,011
我想你会有权阻止我带着Walt离开的
I think you're going to keep me from leaving the country with Walt.

310
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:51,087
但是我只是...想问你为什么
But I just have to ask you why.

311
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:55,055
-什么为什么?  -你为什么这么做?
-Why what?  -Why are you doing this?

312
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:58,053
-他是我的儿子  -从什么时候开始的  Michael?
-He's my son.  -Since when, Michael?

313
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:00,099
听着  我知道你不关心我如何好过
Look, I know you don't care about what's best for me,

314
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,003
但是在罗马  我在公司可以是一个资深合伙人
but in Rome I'll be a senior partner at the firm.

315
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:06,065
我可以给Walt他需要的一切
I'll be able to give Walt anything he needs.

316
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:10,031
你现在行动仍然受限Michael  你无法工作
You're still on disability, Michael.You can't work.

317
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,062
你的公寓快被收回了
You're about to be evicted.

318
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,022
你的律师是在调查我么?
Got your lawyers checking up on me?

319
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:15,033
恩  当然是的
Of course I did.

320
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,072
就像你的律师也在调查我一样
Just like you had your lawyers check up on me.

321
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:22,076
-大家都不是赢家  -那么住口
-Nobody's winning.  -Then stop.

322
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:29,014
Michael  你需要做的第一件事是照顾好你自己
Michael, the first thing you need to do is take care of yourself.

323
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:30,098
你得健康起来
You need to get healthy,

324
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:32,081
你得有足够的经济基础
you need to get back on your feet financially

325
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:36,079
那样你才能继续回去追求你的艺术
so you can get back to pursuing your art.

326
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,066
作为一个艺术家你有罕见的天份  Michael
You have rare talent as an artist,Michael.

327
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:43,007
但是你怎么才能做到这些事呢
But how are you going to do that,any of that,

328
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:47,057
这样能成为Walt生命中的一部分么?
and still be a part of Walt's life?

329
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:50,057
我会通过努力做到的
I'll do it by doing it.

330
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:53,098
抚养Walt也是我的责任
Walt is my responsibility too.

331
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:58,005
那么就放他走
Then let him go.

332
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:00,048
因为这不是关于我和你的事
Because it's not about you or me.

333
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:05,047
这是他的事
It's about him.

334
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:18,063
我不想和你打官司  Michael
I don't want to go to court, Michael.

335
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:22,094
那么就拜托你...
So please, just...

336
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:27,022
放他走吧
let him go.

337
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,076
飞行员说我们失去了无线电联络
The pilot said we had lost radio contact,

338
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:37,028
但是在那之前  我们已经偏离了航线近千里了
but by then we were already a thousand miles off course.

339
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:40,006
并且搜救队几周前就应该放弃搜索了
Any search teams would've given up weeks ago.

340
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:43,012
那么你正从悉尼飞往洛杉矶?
So you were travelling from Sydney to Los Angeles?

341
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,000
是的
Yes.

342
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,057
那么另外那些人还在外面?
So the world is still out there?

343
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:51,046
就我所知  是的
Yeah, as far as I know.

344
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:56,015
你能告诉我你的名字么?
Could you tell me your name?

345
00:28:57,003 --> 00:29:01,042
我的名字?
My name?

346
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:04,033
我叫Desmond
My name is Desmond.

347
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:07,047
Desmond  我是John
Desmond, I'm John.

348
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:10,044
你得明白  现在真的不需要这把枪了
You should know the gun is really unnecessary.

349
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,013
噢  是么?
Oh yeah?

350
00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:17,075
那么我应该把它交给你了  是么?
So I should just hand it over to you then, should I?

351
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,058
你们那儿有多少人?
How many of you are there?

352
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:24,094
呃  43个  但是有4个今天早上坐筏子出海了
43. But four sailed out this morning on a raft.

353
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:27,065
筏子?
A raft?

354
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:31,054
那个模拟日光  是因为你从来不离开么?
That simulated sunlight,is that because you never leave?

355
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:34,065
还有其他的出口么?
Is there another way out?

356

你们有多少人生病了?
How many of your group have gotten sick?

357

生病?
Sick?

358
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:41,096
生病  就是病了死了
Sick. As in ill. As in dead.

359
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:44,009
这就是为什么舱门里写着"检疫隔离"的原因么?
Is that why it says "Quarantine"on the hatch?

360
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,076
-回答我     -没人生病  没有人

Locke

379

Who the hell is that?

380
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:34,032
一定是Jack
That would be Jack.

381
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,042

Who is he?

382
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:54,093
他叫Jack
His name is Jack.

383
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:56,053
他是我们的医生
He's our doctor.

384
00:31:56,053 --> 00:31:58,061
他在这儿干什么?
What's he doing here?

385
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:03,095
老实和你说吧  看到他我也觉得很惊讶
To be honest with you,I'm a little surprised to see him.

386
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:10,011
你们的医生带着枪
Your doctor has a gun, brother.

387
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:13,061
走
Move.

Jack

392
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:47,019
Jack

393
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:51,028
如果是我 我不会这么做  Jack
I wouldn't do that, Jack.

394
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:53,027
- Kate在哪儿?  -你到底...

00:32:56,096 --> 00:32:59,012
-放下枪  -Kate在哪儿?

-Kate在哪儿?  -她没事  放下...
-Where's Kate?  -She's fine. Just put down...

400

我什么也不放
I'm not putting down anything...

401
00:33:06,008 --> 00:33:10,028
你想他死么?  放下枪
Do you want him to die? Put it down.

402
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:12,059
这就是你所说的么  Locke?
Is this what you were talking about,Locke?

403
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,097
这就是你的命运么?
Is this your destiny?

404
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:18,081
-"该发生的总会发生的"    -冷静点
-"All roads lead here"?    -Calm down.

405
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,015
放下枪
Lower your gun,

406
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:25,060
否则我崩了他的脑袋
or I'll blow his damned head off, brother.

407
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,067
是你
You!

408
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:08,058
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that?

409
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:12,060
筏子的一部分  浮着的竹筒
It's part of the raft,one of the pontoons.

410
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,034
别划了
Stop paddling.

411
00:34:15,034 --> 00:34:17,007
嘿  停下
Hey, stop it!

412
00:34:17,007 --> 00:34:22,040
你把绳索拉太猛了  筏子会散架的
You're putting a strain on the vines. It's going to break us up.

413
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,054
混蛋  你会...
Damn it, you're gonna sink us!

414
00:34:25,054 --> 00:34:29,042
Sawyer

415
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:34,098
-上来    -我上来的话我们都会沉下去
-Climb up!    -I do and we both sink.

416
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,025
我游到竹筒那儿去
I'm going for the pontoon.

417
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:46,042
别傻了
Don't be an idiot.

418
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,041
你看到那个尖牙的畜牲
You see that toothy son of a bitch,

419
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:53,080
-瞄准了就开枪  知道了么    -知道了
-you aim and squeeze. Got it?  -Got it.

420
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:12,090
加油  加油  快  快
