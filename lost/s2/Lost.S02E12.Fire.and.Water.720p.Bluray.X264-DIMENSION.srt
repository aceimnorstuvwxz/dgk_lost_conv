上集回顾
Previously on Lost:

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,050
那飞机上装了海洛因

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,095
他说他是在那边丛林发现的
He said he found it in the jungle.

4
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,036
丛林哪儿?
Where?

5
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:16,018
-不过是个雕像嘛  -仅仅是雕像吗?

这是什么?
What's this?

8
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:25,065
这些是在你雕像里发现的
Because this was in your little statue.

9
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:27,022
我不知道
I didn't know.

10
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:32,076
如果是事前藏好的  我怎么会知道?
If it's sealed up inside a statue, how would I know?

11
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,015
你骗了我  Charlie
You lied to me.

12
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:40,036
听着  离我的孩子远点  明白吗?
I can't have you around my baby.

13
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:47,023
Claire Charlie  别再睡我们边上  明白吗?
Claire...I don't want you sleeping anywhere near us.

14
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,002
是百兽王!(一部美国动画片)
Voltron.

15
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:41,084
我的礼物在哪儿?
Where are my presents?

16

18
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:03,047
-是给我的吗?!  -是的  Charlie
-This is mine?  -Yes.

19
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:08,086
圣诞老人一定发现了你的天赋
Father Christmas must've known how talented you are.

20
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:13,038
亲爱的  你是天才

21
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:18,039
总有一天你会带我们离开这儿
Someday you're gonna get us out of here.All of us.

22
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,009

弹吧  小弟弟
Come on, baby brother.

25
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:34,022
如果你不弹琴  你就救不了一家了
You can't save your family if you don't play.

26
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:35,086
来吧  Charlie
Come on, play.

27
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:38,074

音乐哪儿都不能带你去  小Charlie
Music will never get you anywhere, Charlie boy.

31
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:52,034
你必须付出代价
You need a trade.

32
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:54,065
爸爸?
Dad?

33

45
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,053

我应该把雕像的事告诉你

还有里面藏毒品的事

57
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:01,020
我只是希望我们能像以前那样
I just wish things could get back to the way they were before.

58
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,005
可我们没有"以前"  Charlie
There is no "before. "

59
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,079
我们上了同一班飞机后才认识的
We were strangers on a plane and became friends.

60
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,041
现在Locke是你的朋友了?

Karen  这不关他的事

我们从Dresden的俱乐部过来

我跟Karen说你只是错过了飞机

你在干什么  伙计?
What are you doing, man?

146
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:23,055
出什么事了?
What's going on?

147
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:27,040
已经是深夜了  你抱着孩子在那干吗?
What are you doing with the baby?

148
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,057
我不知道
I don't know.

149
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:37,003
来人啊  有人偷了我的孩子!
Help. Somebody took my baby.

150
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,033
Claire  出什么事了?

151
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,040
我不知道  Aaron不见了
I don't know. Aaron's gone.

152
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,051
没事  我们在这儿
It's OK. We're over here.

153
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,063
孩子没事儿吧?  他还好吧?!
Is he all right?

154
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:49,011
Claire...

155
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:51,007
我不清楚发生了什么
I don't know what happened.

156
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:53,077
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:56,073 --> 00:13:02,033
他很好  我做了一个梦
He's OK, though. I had this dream...

158
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,049
不要了?
Stick?

159
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:25,010
不是玩21点吗?  我以为你还会要的
I don't know, dude. Don't I need 21? I think I should hit.

160
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,043
如果拿到6  我就暴了
But I got a six. I'm gonna bust.

161
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:28,095
你怎么知道你会暴?
How do you know that?

162
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:32,068
我不清楚  但你在想我要暴了
I don't. But you gotta assume that I'm gonna bust.

163
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:35,042
为什么?
Why?

164
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:44,074
看看是谁正要去洗衣服呢
Well, well, look who's off to the Laundromat.

165
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:48,066
快去啊
Go on.

166
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:52,083
我想你肯定也有衣服要洗吧  Jethro?
I'm sure you've got a load you need to drop in, Jethro.

167
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:56,057
我在等待时机
I'm kind of waiting for my moment.

168
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:59,046
那么...
Well...

169
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:04,054
你的机会来了  Hoss
Your moment is now, Hoss.

170
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:07,065
嘿  Libby
Hey, Libby.

171
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,070
你一个人啊
Hey, yourself.

172
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:31,049
你好  John
Hey, John.

173
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:33,046
能和你谈谈么?
Talk to you for a second?

174
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,054
好  什么事  Charlie?
What is it? Charlie?

175
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:38,038
我想你已经知道昨晚发生的事了吧?
I take it you heard about what happened last night?

176
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:42,049
你是说你半夜里把Claire的孩子偷走的事
You taking the baby out of Claire's tent in the middle of the night?

177
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,075
是的  我听说了
I heard.

178
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:46,093
整件事就是个误会  John  当时我在梦游
It was a big misunderstanding. I was sleepwalking.

179
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,081
我也不知道怎么了
I don't know how or why.

180
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:50,086
你想我帮什么忙呢  Charlie?
Is there something you want from me??

181
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:53,044
我想你替我跟Claire解释一下
I was hoping you could speak to Claire for me.

182
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:55,098
你懂的  帮我说点好话
Put in a good word.

183
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:58,062
你还在碰那东西吗?
Are you using?

184
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,050
什么?
What?

185
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,086
海洛因  你还在吸毒么?
Heroin. Are you using again?

186
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:06,092
Kate看到一只马  有吗
Kate sees a horse, nothing.

187
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:09,051
几乎每天都有人看到Walt在丛林里晃荡
Pretty much everybody's seen Walt in the jungle.

188
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,012
怎么轮到我  就肯定是因为吸毒的原因呢?
When it's Charlie, it must be the drugs.

189
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:15,008
好吧  你还没正面回答我呢
It's funny, you didn't answer the question.

190
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:17,078
还记得那驾飞机吗  John?
You remember the plane?

191
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:20,066
我和Eko把它烧了
We burned it. Eko and me.

192
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:23,073
我们把一切都烧掉了  包括海洛因  还有那些雕像
We burned the whole thing. The heroin, the statues.

193
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:27,035
都没了  销毁了
It's all gone, destroyed.

194
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:28,072
全部么?
All of them?

195
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:31,094
当然
All of them.

196
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:39,054
失去的信任是很难找回来的
Trust is a hard thing to win back.

197
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:42,020
Claire还需要时间
Claire needs time.

198
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,090
你得让他们母子静一静
You should leave her and the baby alone for a while.

199
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:07,033
你还好吧?  你脸色很差
Can you do this? You look green.

200
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,056
滚开  我很好
Sod off. I'm fine.

201
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:12,033
好的  我们再来一遍
Let's give this another go, shall we?

202
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:16,022
那好  振作起来好吗?  免得你忘记  我们就得这样
Get it together. Lest you forget, we need this.

203
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:18,022
给我杯茶
Tea.

204
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:20,014
你们准备好了么?
So, you lads ready?

205
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:21,077
当然  我们准备好了
We're ready. Let's go.

206
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:23,017
这次别演砸了  行么?
Let's try not to blow it this time.

207
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:24,077
谢了  你还好吧 没问题
You good?

208
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,061
我们还有二十分钟
We've only 20 minutes till we're in overtime.

209
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:32,064
现在  各就各位  准备好
Get it right.

210
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,005
留心你的拖鞋

211
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:38,093

All right.

212

214
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,059
都把产品举起来
Hold the product up.

215

217
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:50,043
开始!
And action.

218
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:05,013

Acting like...

219
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,084
停!
Cut.

220
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:11,006
没事儿
It's all right.

221
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:13,039
就这样  收工!
That's it. We're wrapped.

222
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,025
等等  伙计  等等!
No. Mate. Hang on.

223
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,036
等等
Wait.

224
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,083
等等  你这是什么意思?
What are you doing?

225
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,098
我们别浪费时间了
Let's not waste any more time.

226
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:24,005
用你们已经是给你们律师面子了
You were only hired as a favour to your lawyer.

227
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,012
我找Dirt Spigot
I wanted Dirt Spigot.

228
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,049
得了  伙计
Come on, mate.

229
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,078
再给我们一次机会
Give us another chance.

230
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,071
你想再来一次吗?  那就听我的
You want another chance? Take my advice.

231
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:35,093
甩掉他  他是害群之马
Ditch that one. He's a bloody disaster.

232
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:39,070
我不会丢下任何一个
I'm not ditching anyone.

233
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,084
他是我兄弟
He's my brother.

234
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:44,021
好吧  那这样
Right. Well, then,

235
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,088
我想你被解雇了
I guess you're fired.

236
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:51,087
这儿就洗衣机和干衣机还不错了  是吧?
Is this washer and dryer newer than everything else in here?

237
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:54,002
对我来说  只要能洗就行
It washes clothes. That's all I need to know.

238
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:55,090
总算
Finally.

239
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,032
有人觉得这事容易了
Someone who keeps it simple.

240
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:00,087
看这件衣服
Look at this.

241
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:04,075
我在一个没人要的皮箱里找到的
I got it in some of the abandoned luggage.

242
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:08,042
你觉得我穿了好看么?
You think I can pull this off?

243
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:11,092
让我给你点提示
Let me give you a hint.

244
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:15,015
通常如果一个女孩这样问
When a girl asks that kind of question,

245
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:18,070
那她就是想得到称赞
she's looking for validation.

246
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:23,077
我们...之前见过么?
Do I know you from somewhere?

247
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:28,001
你指除了在飞机上之外?
You mean other than the flight?

248
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:30,086
飞机上... 好了  转过身去
The flight... Turn around.

249
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:34,000
转过去  转过去  我想试试这件衣服
Turn around. I'm gonna try it on.

250
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,011
-好吧  尽管试  -不许偷看
-Sure, go ahead.  -No peeking.

251
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:46,020
我不敢相信你忘了曾经踩过我的脚
I cannot believe you don't remember stepping on my foot.

252
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,035
-是么?  -当然咯  而且还踩的很痛
-I did?  -Yes, you did. And it was hard.

253
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:53,001
我记得你因为你是最后一个上飞机的
I remember you were the last one on the flight,

254
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:57,056
你急急忙忙全身是汗  还戴着耳机
and you were all sweaty and you had headphones on

255
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:59,063
喀一声
and crunch,

256
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:01,094
然后你就踩了我
you stepped on my foot.

257
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:05,027
好了  转过来吧
Turn around.

258
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:11,072
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

259
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:14,091
太好看了
It's awesome.

260
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:18,082
谢谢
Thanks.

261
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:27,062
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

262
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:31,002
给树做记号
I'm marking trees.

263
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:34,020
为什么?
Why?

264
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:37,038
因为...
Because

265
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,086
这些是我的爱好
these are the ones I like.

266
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:45,040
你告诉Locke我拿了飞机上的雕像么?
Did you tell Locke you gave me a statue from the plane?

267
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,091
我为什么要那样做?
Why would I do that?

268
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:50,017
可他知道了  伙计
He knows, man.

269
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:53,098
那个秃子好像知道了什么
That bald wanker knows something.

270
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,038
出什么问题了  Charlie?
Is something wrong?

271
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,046
除了有点失控之外  别的还行
Apart from me losing my mind? No. Everything's peachy.

272
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:02,034
为什么你说你有点失控呢?
Why would you say you are losing your mind?

273
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,005
要不怎么会梦游
How about the fact that I've been sleepwalking?

274
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:08,075
半夜把孩子抱走...
Stealing babies from their cribs?

275
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:12,008
还有真实不能再真实的梦
And the vivid dreams that make me feel like I'm awake

276
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:16,022
直到醒来才发现是假的
until, of course, I wake up.

277
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,087
你都梦到了什么?
What are your dreams about?

278
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:25,098
各种有关Aaron遇险的事...
Variations of Aaron being in mortal peril.

279
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,075
困在钢琴里
Trapped in a piano.

280
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:30,068
漂浮在大海里...
Drifting out to sea.

281
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:32,024
还有一只鸽子
There's the flying dove,

282
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:37,086
Claire和我的妈妈穿的像个天使 并告诉我要我去救那个孩子
and Claireand my mum dressed as angels telling me I need to save the baby.

283
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,098
怎么了?
What?

284
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:50,060
你是否想过这些梦有某些含义?
Have you ever considered that these dreams mean something?

285
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:53,007
例如?
Like what?

286
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:57,029
假如你真应该去保护那个孩子呢?
What if you do need to save the baby?

287
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,020
我有话要跟她说
I have to talk to her.

288
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:07,056
不  我现在一定要跟她说  她会听的
She'll wanna hear this.

289
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:12,064
-你知道什么了?告诉我 我转告她  -Kate 不 不 Claire!
-Tell me and I will tell her.  -Kate,no,no, Claire!

290
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:14,048
Claire  听我说
Please.

291
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:16,037
-Aaron有危险  -你说什么?
-Aaron's in danger.  -What?

292
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:20,042
孩子有危险!  听着 我一直在做那个梦 我知道那意味着什么
The baby's in danger.I've been having these dreams.I know what they mean now.

293
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:23,091
Claire  听着  我们必须给Aaron作个洗礼
We have to baptise Aaron.

294
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:25,076
-什么?  -我们可以做的  Eko就是个神父
-What?  -We can do this. Eko's a priest.

295
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:29,057
－我们可以做的   －说完了吧  说完了就走吧
-We can do this.  -You've said your piece.It's time for you to go.

296
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:32,063
不  等等  我不能走  Claire  我们必须给Aaron做洗礼!
Wait. We have to baptise Aaron.

297
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:37,022
Claire  孩子有危险  我们必须这么做  必须!
He's in danger. We've got to do this.

298
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,074
给  下雨的时候用的着
Here. For when it rains.

299
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:02,081
谢谢
Thanks.

300
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:18,016
你打算什么时候告诉我丛林里发生了什么?
When are you gonna tell me what happened in the jungle?

301
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:19,057
我已经说了
I already did.

302
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:22,083
拉紧点否则会松的
Pull it tighter, or it'll sag.

303
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,074
你只告诉我那家伙说了什么
You told me what that guy said.

304
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,006
你还没说你为什么要返回那儿
You didn't tell me what made you turn around.

305
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:34,047
为什么你又回来了
What made you come back.

306
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:37,080
他拿枪指着Kate的头
He had a gun at Kate's head.

307
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:44,056
你反感那样?
You hitting that?

308
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,038
你什么意思?
What?

309
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:50,023
飞机失事...你们却活下来了...
Plane crash. You both survived.

310
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:52,015
美丽的沙滩...
Nice beach. She's hot, you're hot.

311
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:57,008
她很热情你也一样  是人都会这么做的
She's hot, you're hot.That's what people do.

312
00:22:57,086 --> 00:23:01,008
我并非"反感那样"
I'm not "hitting that. "

313
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:36,049
Karen把我甩了
Karen kicked me out, man.

314
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,093
什么?
What?

315
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,043
发生什么事了?
What happened?

316
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:45,046
她...

317
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:48,065
她觉得跟我在一起没有安全感
She thinks I'm dangerous.

318
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,094
她为什么会那么想?
Why would she think that?

319
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:57,015
因为我冷谈了她
Because I dropped her.

320
00:24:57,015 --> 00:25:00,052
我抛弃了Megan
I dropped Megan.

321
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:06,099
Liam  没事儿的
Liam, it's all right.

322
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:11,043
我没钱  什么都没有
We've got no money.We've got nothing.

323
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:13,087
我们能干什么?
What are we gonna do?

324
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:18,056
-我们能熬过去的  -怎么熬?
-We'll get through this.  -Yeah? How's that?

325
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:21,016
我又开始写歌了
I'm writing again.

326
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:23,058
我写了首新歌
I got a new song.

327
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:25,024
是关于兄弟的
It's about two brothers.

328
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,087
两个本应做屠夫的兄弟
Who should've been butchers.

329
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:29,057
别这么说  这是首好歌
Don't say that. This is a good one.

330
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:31,049
我觉得会一鸣惊人
I feel like this might be the one

331
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,045
好了  先听听
Listen to this.

332
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,032
真滑稽
Nice, man.

333
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:48,046
你发现我站在这儿

334
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:52,039
真可笑

335
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:58,082
我在雨中哭泣

336
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:03,064
就这样

337
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:10,007
我们永不言败

338
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:15,036
振作起来

339
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:20,083
我们能生存下来

340
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,061
不错吧
This could work.

341
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:23,086
肯定能红
It's good,

342
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:26,019
不错吧? 我们能办到的
right? We could make it work.

343
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:29,093
就像过去一样写歌
Write all night, just like the old days.

344
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,064
恩  然后呢?
So,

345
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,049
好兄弟
baby brother,

346
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,090
你还有那个（海洛因）吗?
you got any?

347
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,003
我对你很失望  Charlie
I'm disappointed in you.

348
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:48,047
你跟踪我?
You followed me?

349
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:51,065
你来这里多久了?
How long you been coming out here?

350
00:26:51,065 --> 00:26:53,098
John  你误会了
You've got the wrong idea, man.

351
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:55,040
你说你把海洛因全部销毁了  结果呢  这还有
You said you destroyed them and yet here they are.

352
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,036
这也是个误会吗?

353
00:26:57,036 --> 00:27:00,006
我来就是为了销毁它们的  我就要这么做了
I came to finish the job, to get rid of these.

354
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:03,053
被我发现了  你当然就这么说啦
Very convenient, now that I've found them.

355
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:05,008
你打算怎么做?
What are you doing?

356
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,093
我已经给你机会了
There was a time when I let you choose

357
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:12,022
让你选择你是否还需要它们
whether or not you were gonna do this to yourself.

358
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:15,017
现在  让我帮你下决心
Now I'm making that choice for you.

359
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:16,053
你不相信我?
You don't believe me?

360
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:20,060
给我  给我  看...我现在就销毁他们!
Give them to me right now. I'll destroy them.

361
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,056
我把它们全扔了  让它们随这鬼风飘走!
I'll throw them in the sodding wind.

362
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:25,015
听着  John  我知道我撒谎了 好吧?
Look, John,I know I lied, all right?

363
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:27,051
等等  你等等  John
Just wait.

364
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:29,015
记得我们说过什么吗?
Remember all those talks we had?

365
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,074
你跟我说过
You and me?

366
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:34,059
在这里发生的任何一件事 都有一个理由
You said everything happens for a reason.

367
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,084
这个岛正在考验我们
This island tests us.

368
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:41,013
这就是一个  John  一个考验 是对我的考验  这就是海洛因还在这的原因
That's what this is. This is my test. That's why these are here.

369
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:43,002
那是因为你把它们藏在这里了  Charlie
These are here because you put them here.

370
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:46,039
不  等等  John  等等
Wait.

371
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,007
你到哪儿去?
What are you gonna do?

372
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:51,022
你打算告诉Claire?
Are you gonna tell Claire?

373
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:52,059
不可以
You can't.

374
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,096
如果她看到这些  我就完了
If she sees them, I'm done.

375
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:56,051
她再也不会相信我了  而她现在需要信任我  John
She'll never trust me again, and she has to.

376
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:59,073
都是为了孩子  对吧?
It's about the baby.

377
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:02,070
Aaron有危险
Aaron's in danger.

378
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,098
你必须相信我
You have to believe me.

379
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:10,002
你自己放弃了被人信任的权利  Charlie
You've given up the right to be believed.

380
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:31,042
我们的小男孩怎么样了?
Hi.How's our boy?

381
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,075
他很好
He's good.

382
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:36,089
John  我能问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you something?

383
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,052
当然
Sure.

384
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:40,026
你是否相信
Do you think Aaron and I

385
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:45,069
我和Aaron能在机舱里待着么?
could stay in the bedroom in the hatch for a while?

386
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:50,002
每隔一个半小时就会有很吵报警声
Alarm goes off every hour and a half.

387
00:28:50,002 --> 00:28:53,016
不适合婴儿在那儿过夜
It's not the best place for a baby to sleep through the night.

388
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:57,019
当然
Yeah, sure.

389
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,079
要不我把帐篷搬过来
How about if I move my stuff down here,

390
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,001
就靠着你的帐篷
set up right next to your tent?

391
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:08,082
如果能那样最好了  谢谢你
That'd be great. Thanks.

392
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:12,015
好  就这么定了
Then consider it done.

393
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:14,063
John  你是否了解
You don't know anything about baptism,

394
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:17,063
你是否了解有关洗礼的事?
do you?

395
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:20,075
不是很了解  怎么了?
Not a whole lot. Why?

396
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:25,004
Charlie之前来我的这儿并且...
Charlie came by my tent before.

397
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:29,034
他说Aaron必须要接受洗礼...
He told me Aaron had to be baptised.

398
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:34,077
因为他有危险
That he was in danger.

399
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:41,017
我的理解是洗礼能保证无论发生什么
My understanding is baptism is about making sure children get into heaven,

400
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:44,028
小孩子将来都能进天堂
should anything happen.

401
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,016
因此称为"精神保险"
Call it spiritual insurance.

402
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:53,011
这儿很安全  Claire
There isn't any danger.

403
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:56,016
Charlie只是...
Charlie just...

404
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:04,088
Charlie只是感觉他有义务保护孩子
Charlie just feels like he has to save the baby

405
00:30:04,088 --> 00:30:08,044
因为他无法保护自己
because he can't save himself.

406
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,058
晚上见
I'll see you tonight.

407
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:14,054
好的
OK.

408
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:03,029
Charlie  能帮我们一把吗?
Charlie, can you give us a hand?

409
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:06,043
现在不行  Sayid
Now's not a good time, Sayid.

410
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:09,001
我们把它抬起来
Let's lift this.

411
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:12,004
好的  搞定了
Okay,I got it. I got it.

412
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:22,087
着火了  着火了!
Fire.Fire.

413
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:26,027
拿上工具  还有盛沙子的  还有其他能带的
Grab tools, containers for sand, anything you have.

414
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:30,049
如果现在不扑灭  火会烧到营地这儿的!
If we don't stop it now, it'll burn right through the camp.

415
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,030
在这儿看好Aaron
Stay here with Aaron.

416
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:41,032
我们需要从这儿把火势切断!
We need to cut a fire break right here.

417
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,054
保证一个桶的距离!
Form a bucket line.

418
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:45,034
带上一些人  去弄点水!
Some of you people, down to the water.

419
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:47,063
Sawyer!

420
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:51,000
我们会处理的  在这等着!
You're heading them off. Right here.

421
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:24,074
Liam?!

422
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:28,032
我的钢琴
My piano.

423
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:32,098
发生...出什么事了?
What's going on?

424
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:34,080
Liam

425
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,010
我的钢琴呢?
Where's my piano?

426
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,091
我卖了
I sold it.

427
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:42,013
什么?
You what?

428
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,064
-等等  -别管我
-Wait.  -Get off me.

429
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:47,006
那钱呢?  又去买毒品了?!
Where's the money? Is it up your sodding arm?

430
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,083
我没有  我已经两天不吸了
I'm clean. I haven't used in two days.

431
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:52,057
两天?  真该恭喜你啊!
Two days? Happy anniversary.

432
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:53,090
那你多就不碰了?
How long you been clean?

433
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,042
钱到哪儿去了?
Where's the money?

434
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,098
她要离开我
She was gonna leave me.

435
00:32:57,098 --> 00:33:00,046
Charlie  她想把Megan带走
She was gonna take Megan.

436
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:02,009
你打算怎么办  Liam?
What did you do?

437
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:04,042
Karen在澳洲有个叔叔
Karen's got an uncle in Australia.

438
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:05,094
他能给我一份工作
He's gonna get me a job.

439
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:07,075
悉尼有个戒毒中心
There's a rehab clinic in Sydney.

440
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:11,056
我们需要去那儿的钱
I just needed the money to get us there.

441
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:14,037
我不得不这么做
I have to do this.

442
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:17,029
为了她们母女  为了我的家庭
I have to take care of myself, for them, for my family.

443
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:20,051
我必须好起来

444
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,073
我也是你的家人啊!
I'm your family.

445
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:26,054
再等等  你就不能再等等吗?
Wait. Will you just wait?

446
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:27,095
我再也不能等了  Charlie
I can't.

447
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:32,028
你走了乐队怎么办?  那首歌怎么办?
What about the band? What about the song?

448
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:37,035
请你理解  我必须走
Try to understand. I have to go.

449
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:39,032
必须
I have to.

450
00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:44,071
好吧  事情安顿好之后我会联络你的
I'll give you a call when things settle down for me.

451
00:33:44,071 --> 00:33:46,086
都为你?  那我呢?
For you? What about me?

452
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:49,052
我的家庭怎么办?
What about my family?

453
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:53,059
我的家怎么办?
What about my family?

454
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:23,017
Charlie!  你在干什么?!
What are you doing?

455
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:25,039
我必须这么做!  他带走了我的孩子!
I'm doing what I have to do. He's got my baby.

456
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,040
-住手!  -不!Claire  没事儿的!
-Stop it.  -It's all right.

457
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,002
-Charlie  住手!  -这不是... 不!我...
-Help! Help!  -It's not...

458
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:33,029
救命啊! 来人啊! 来人啊! 他抢了我的孩子!
Somebody, help! He's got my baby!

459
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,007
来人啊!
Come on,

460
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,021
够了  Charlie  求求你了
please.

461
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,058
别这么做
Stop.

462
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:40,028
我只想救他!
I just want to save him.

463
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:43,065
Charlie!  够了! 求求你!
-Charlie!  -It's all right.

464
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:48,006
把孩子给我
Give me the baby.

465
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:52,084
Eko  告诉他们!  都告诉他们Eko!
Eko, tell them.

466
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:56,028
告诉他们你跟我说的那些  你说孩子必须接受洗礼!
Tell them what you told me. That the baby has to be baptised.

467
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:59,058
不是这种方式
This is not the way.

468
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,031
Charlie...

469
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:03,027
来  把孩子给我
Give him to me.

470
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,023
你以为你是谁  John?!
Who the hell are you?

471
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:07,064
Aaron的事跟你无关!
Aaron's not your responsibility.

472
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,031
他出生的时候你在哪儿?!
Where were you when he was born?

473
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:11,031
他出事儿的时候你又在哪里?!
When he was taken?

474
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,083
你不是他的父亲
You're not his father.

475
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:15,052
你和他不是一家人!
You're not his family.

476
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:19,012
你也不是  Charlie
Neither are you.

477
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:26,062
我必须做  我知道
I have to do this. I need to.

478
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:29,013
我不想伤害他
I'm not gonna hurt him.

479
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:33,009
可你伤害了我  Charlie
You're hurting me.

480
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:04,020
Claire.

481
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,046
对不起
I'm sorry.

482
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:56,008
你得缝一下
You need stitches.

483
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:13,087
忍一下
Try to be still.

484
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:25,096
火是我放的  Jack
I started the fire.

485
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:29,047
我知道
Yeah, I know.

486
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:30,093
我太绝望了  她不...
I was desperate.

487
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:34,022
我需要知道你再也不会干这种傻事儿了
I need to know you're never gonna do anything like this again.

488
00:37:34,022 --> 00:37:37,003
再也不
Ever.

489
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:39,081
我知道后果
I know what this looks like,

490
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:42,011
人们会怎么想
what people think.

491
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:45,011
这都不重要了  但是...
It doesn't matter now,

492
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:48,018
我没吸毒
but I didn't use.

493
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:51,044
我很想
I wanted to.

494
00:37:51,044 --> 00:37:54,095
我真的很想
I really wanted to.

495
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:59,039
但我忍住了
But I didn't.

496
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:03,064
这不是我关心的  Charlie
That's not what I asked.

497
00:38:04,012 --> 00:38:07,086
不会再发生了
It's not gonna happen again.

498
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:55,009
Charlie告诉我你是个神父
Charlie told me you're a priest.

499
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:58,042
是的

500
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:00,041
他说是你告诉他的  我必须...
He said you told him that I had to have...

501
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:04,045
我没有让Charlie那样做
I did not tell Charlie to do what he did.

502
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:08,023
他误解了这我很抱歉
I'm sorry if he misunderstood me.

503
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:15,005
但你是否也认为这孩子必须接受洗礼?
But do you think the baby has to be baptised?

504
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:18,065
你知道洗礼是什么吗?
Do you know what baptism is?

505
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:22,028
它可以让你进入天堂
It's what gets you into heaven.

506
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:29,094
施洗约翰给耶稣洗礼时
It is said that when John the Baptist baptised Jesus,

507
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:31,079
天堂开了
the skies opened up

508
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,027
一只鸽子从天空中飞下来
and a dove flew down from the sky.

509
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:38,000
它告诉约翰
This told John something,

510
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,015
他已经帮这个人洗净了所有的罪孽
that he had cleansed this man of all his sins,

511
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:45,000
约翰释放了他
that he had freed him.

512
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:49,085
天堂最终还是接纳了他
Heaven came much later.

513
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:53,085
我没被洗礼过
I haven't been baptised.

514
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:57,039
是不是说如果你给Aaron做洗礼
Does that mean if you do it to Aaron

515
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,069
一旦发生了什么事
and something happened to us,

516
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:04,090
我跟她就不能在一起了?
that we wouldn't be together?

517
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:11,079
如果你们都接受洗洗了就没事了
Not if I baptise you both.

518
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:31,060
