00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:03,046
剧情回顾...
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:05,020
Desmond说我会死的
Desmond said I was gonna die.

3
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:08,001
他告诉我他有某种幻觉
He told me he has these flashes... visions.

4
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:11,022
当我看到闪电击打顶蓬时 你被电死了
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,you were electrocuted.

5
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:13,001
当你听到Claire溺水时
And when you heard Claire was in the water,

6
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:16,006
为了救她  你自己却淹死了 我下了水才救了你的命
you drowned trying to save her.I dove in myself, so you never went in.

7
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:17,072
不管我怎么努力
No matter what I try to do,

8
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:19,026
你总是要死的 Charlie
you're gonna die, Charlie.

9
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,074
在Hurley的帐篷里有个女人
There's a woman in Hurley's tent

10
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:22,073
她昨天才跳伞 来到这个岛上
who parachuted onto the island yesterday.

11
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:25,082
她说她的船就在距离 这里80英里的地方
She says that the boat she took off from is about 80 miles off the coast,

12
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:28,091
如果她能与那艘船取得联系 我们就得救了
and if she can find a way to contact it,we'll all be rescued.

13
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:30,042
为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

14
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,026
因为他们不信任你
Because they don't trust you.

15
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:33,050
Kwon怀孕了
Kwon is pregnant.

16
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:34,061
你从哪里弄到的?
Where'd you get that?

17
00:00:34,062 --> 00:00:36,097
你以为你有权利 来问我们吗?
You really think you're in a position to ask questions?

18
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:39,016
我告诉Jack 他们逼我这样做的
I told Jack what they were making me do.

19
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:40,066
为什么不告诉我们?
Why didn't you tell us?

20
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:43,049
因为我还不知道 该怎么做
Because I hadn't decided what to do about it yet.

21
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:20,048
有人知道...
Anyone wants to venture a guess

22
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,063
Jack把我们带到 这荒僻的地方来干什么吗?
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us out in the middle of nowhere?

23
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:26,026
我也不知道 是看些东西吧
I don't know. Stuff.

24
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:28,044
也许是秘密的东西
Probably secret stuff.

25
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:30,051
有必要每件事都保密吗?
Why does everything have to be such a secret?

26
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:33,020
为什么大家不坦诚一些呢?
How about some openness for a change?

27
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:35,020
我们为那个跳伞的女人保密
We kept the parachute lady secret.

28
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:36,051
这个性质不同
Ah, that's different.

29
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,001
怎么不同法?
Different how?

30
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:41,020
因为我们可没有 到那里去和他们"踢足球"
Well, because we weren't out there playing football with them.

31
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:43,053
怎么了?
What?

32
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:44,070
没什么
Nothing.

33
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,030
等等
Wait.

34
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:50,001
你又有幻觉了是吗?
You had one of your flashes again,didn't you?

35
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:53,024
不  Charlie  没有
No, Charlie, I didn't.

36
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:57,089
我们到了
We're here.

37
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,070
几天前...
A couple of nights ago,

38
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:13,095
Juliet告诉了我所有的事...
Juliet came to me,and she told me everything...

39
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:17,014
Ben让她来找出 我们这里的孕妇
That Ben had sent her here to find out which of our women were pregnant.

40
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:18,090
那你们想在我们身上做实验咯?
So what, you guys were doing tests on us?

41
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:22,038
不  但他要我这样做
No, but that's what he wanted me to do.

42
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:26,003
我把磁带 留在那个医疗站里
I've been leaving tapes at the medical station.

43
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,051
你们都听见他说的了
You all heard what he said.

44
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:30,027
他们明天就来
They're coming tomorrow.

45
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:34,020
Sun 很抱歉对你撒了谎
Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

46
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,038
我很感激你的坦诚 Jack
While I appreciate your honesty, Jack,

47
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,058
但这也不能解释为什么 把我们带来这里
it doesn't explain why you brought us out here.

48
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:45,058
Danielle

49
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:55,077
让他们瞧瞧
Show'em.

50
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:18,051
当Juliet告诉我 他们要来时
When Juliet told me they where coming,

51
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:20,092
我想到的第一件事就是...
the first thing I thought was,

52
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:23,052
这次我们又要往哪儿躲?
where the hell are we gonna hide this time?

53
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,007
躲躲藏藏是没用的
But hiding's pointless.

54
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:27,088
他们还会不断的回来
They're just gonna keep coming back.

55
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:30,083
所以我出去寻求帮助
So I went out, and I found some help.

56
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,000
在这几天里
And for the past few days,

57
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,099
她一直从"黑岩"那边 搬炸药回来
she's been bringing dynamite back from "the black rock."

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,015
难得这一次...
For the very first time,

59
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,044
我们知道他们想要什么 他们什么时候会来
we know exactly what they want,when they're coming to get it,

60
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:42,040
而且他们还蒙在鼓里
and they have no idea

61
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,093
我们会在这里等着他们
that we're gonna be waiting for'em.

62
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:48,052
Juliet会按照原来的指示
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents

63
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:51,044
用白色的石头给帐篷做标记
with the white rocks,just like she was told to,

64
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:53,066
但里面不会有孕妇
but there's not gonna be any pregnant women inside.

65
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:57,014
里面有的是我们 用在那颗树上的东西
There's gonna be plenty of what we used on that tree.

66
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:59,071
明天晚上...
So tomorrow night...

67
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,015
我们不再躲藏
We stop hiding.

68
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,032
我们不再逃跑
We stop running.

69
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:07,044
我们不再生活在恐惧之中 因为当他们出现时...
We stop living in fear of them,because when they show up...

70
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:10,074
我们会把他们炸上天
we're gonna blow'em all to hell.

75
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,075
该死的!
Bloody hell!

76
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,038
我们干嘛要这样做?
Why are we even doing this?

77
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,066
冷静点  老兄
Chin up, mate.

78
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,093
-我们在做宣传   -宣传?
-We're headlining.   -Headlining?

79
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:42,050
我们要在Clitheroe演出...
We're playing Clitheroe...

80
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:43,088
这里又是哪里?
The arse end of nowhere.

81
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:45,026
演出是演出
A gig's a gig.

82
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:46,063
可我们得发展我们的歌迷
We're building our fan base.

83
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:49,038
我们的歌迷会给我们 买个新轮胎吗?
Will our fan base pay for a new sodding tire?

84
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,054
只有当我们 出现在公众场合
Only if we show up.

85
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:54,041
所以我们还是走吧  好吗?
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

86
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,078
你知道吗 Liam?
You know what, Liam?

87
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,013
你去吧
You get on with it.

88
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:58,057
我不干了
I quit.

89
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:01,032
-你就这样放弃了吗?    -我们根本没什么可放弃的!
-You're giving up?   -There's nothing to give up on!

90
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,044
我们破产了  专辑根本卖不出去! 我们只是个笑话!
We're broke! The album's not selling! We're a bloody joke!

91
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:06,076
都闭嘴!
Hey, shut it!

92
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:09,077
听
Listen.

93
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,000
那是我们
That's us.

94
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:20,060
我们上电台了!
We're on the radio!

95
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:23,048
那是我们
That we are.

96
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:27,025
我们他妈的上电台了!
We're on the bloody radio!

97
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:32,028
我告诉过你  兄弟!
I told you, baby brother!

98
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:35,094
我们会成为摇滚明星的
We're gonna be bloody rock stars.

99
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,044
能问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you something?

100
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,095
你们在向谁开战?
Who are you people about to go to war with?

101
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:50,042
说来话长
Oh, that's a long story.

102
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:52,069
还想问我什么?
Want to ask me something else?

103
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,056
你在笑吗?
You having a laugh?

104
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,098
当然不是
Of course not.

105
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:58,095
我绝不会不尊重 曼彻斯特同胞的
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

106
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:01,030
-你是曼彻斯特的咯?   -是啊
-You're from Manchester, then?   -I am.

107
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:04,073
我们的乐队是从Oldham大街上的 一个酒吧开始的
My band got its start at the night and day bar on Oldham street.

108
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,092
-什么乐队?      -我们叫它"Drive Shaft"
-What band?     -We were called Drive Shaft.

109
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:09,052
是啊  我认识你
Yeah. Yeah, I know you.

110
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,044
我们有过一段辉煌的日子
We had our moment in the sun.

111
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:13,023
不  不是那个...是坠机
No, not that... the crash.

112
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,066
你是那个死了的 摇滚巨星
You're the dead rock star.

113
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:17,036
他们找到飞机后 就开始宣传这件事
They made a big deal out of you when they found the plane.

114
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:19,039
什么纪念活动啦 新唱片啦
Huge memorial service, new album.

115
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,052
还有新唱片?
There's a new album?

116
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:22,046
到处都有卖...
Yeah. God, it was everywhere...

117
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:25,081
还是"精选集"来着
A "greatest hits" thing.

118
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:31,086
往好的方面去想
Hey, look on the bright side.

119
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:35,030
你没有真死  对吗?
You're not really dead, right?

120
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:38,031
是啊
Yeah, right.

121
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,046
我们需要更多的导线
We need more wire,

122
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,067
以便于能在 安全的距离引爆
so we can trigger these from a safe distance.

123
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,093
我可以叫他们去 飞机残骸那找找
I can get people to start stripping the plane wreckage.

124
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:09,091
很好  我们应该在24小时内
Good. I should be able to finish rigging these tents

125
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,068
把帐篷都布置好
in the next 24 hours.

126
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:15,038
为明晚做好充分的准备
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

127
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:21,002
我们得谈谈Naomi电话的事
We need to talk about Naomi's phone.

128
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:22,092
-不是现在    -如果你因为我怀疑你而生气
-Not now.    -If you're angry I doubted you,

129
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:24,096
等等我会向你道歉的
I'd be happy to make a sincere apology later,

130
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:27,095
-但现在我们有...     -我现在很忙
-but now we have a means...    -Look, I'm a little bit busy right now.

131
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:32,032
我努力想让大家都得救!
And I am trying to get us off this island!

132
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,083
我不能往外发信号
I can't transmit using this phone

133
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:39,092
因为Danielle的求救信号 阻隔了我们的信号
because Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency.

134
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,074
如果你能带我们去 那个无线电塔
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

135
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:44,036
我就能把你的信号关掉 然后发出求救信号
I can go there, switch off your message and call for help.

136
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:46,094
我的信号 已经播放了16年了
My signal has been playing for the last 16 years,

137
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:48,023
但谁都没收到
and nobody has heard it.

138
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:50,011
你怎么肯定 你的运气比我更好?
Why do you think you'll have better luck?

139
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:54,041
Naomi的船就在80英里外
Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore.

140
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,086
我相信只要关闭Danielle的信号 他们就能听到我们
I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

141
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,074
不  他们不会的
No, they won't.

142
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:00,082
怎么会?
And why is that?

143
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,029
都是我们在阻挠
We're jamming it.

144
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,037
什么?
What?

145
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,007
Ben在使用一个达摩的站
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations

146
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:07,061
来阻挠除了我们 所有发出岛的信号
to block all of the signals off of the island except for ours.

147
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:08,099
那是什么站?
What station?

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,039
他们叫它"守望镜"
They call it the "Looking Glass."

149
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,084
-守望镜?    -是的
-The looking glass?    -Yes.

150
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:17,001
但那在海底 我也不知道在哪儿
But it's underwater.I have no idea where it is.

151
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:20,037
我想我知道
I believe I do.

152
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:22,061
我知道Jack总不会错的
Look, I know...I know Jack thinks it's best,

153
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:27,012
但他们来找他怎么办?
but, you know, what if they're coming for him again?

154
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:29,061
Claire 听我说
Claire, listen to me.

155
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:31,036
我会保护你的
I'm gonna protect you.

156
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:34,025
我会保护Aaron
I'm gonna protect Aaron.

157
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:36,025
我保证
I promise.

158
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:40,026
一切都会好起来的
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

159
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:44,055
抱歉
Sorry.

160
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:48,079
Charlie 能帮下忙吗?
Can you give me a hand with something?

161
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,025
当然 Desmond
yeah,Desmond,Of course.

162
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:07,042
你可以说你今天早上 看到什么了吗?
So you ready to tell me what you saw this morning?

163
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:09,067
好吧
Aye.

164
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:13,098
这次又会发生什么?
Right. So how does it happen this time?

165
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:17,048
说啊 Des!
Come on, Des!

166
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:21,001
你可以告诉我 我能接受的
You can tell me. I can take it.

167
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:27,029
我看见的...Charlie  是...
What I saw, Charlie, was...

168
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,060
Claire和她的宝宝 登上了直升机...
Claire and her baby getting into a helicopter...

169
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:33,041
那个直升机...
A helicopter that...

170
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:38,004
从这座岛上起飞了
That lifts off, leaves this island.

171
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,085
你确定吗?
You sure?

172
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,035
是的
Aye.

173
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:47,004
救援飞机...
Rescue helicopter...

174
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,035
在这个海滩?
On this beach?

175
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:51,085
这个岛?  你看见了吗?
This island? That's what you saw?

176
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,045
我们都得救了!
We're getting bloody rescued!

177
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:58,084
我还以为我又会死了呢!
I thought you were gonna tell me I was gonna die again.

178
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:05,023
是的 Charlie
You are, Charlie.

179
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:08,042
等等  你说什么?
Wait. What?

180
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:10,074
如果你不死的话...
If you don't...

181
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:13,099
这些就都不会发生
None of it will happen.

182
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:17,046
不会有什么救援
There won't be any rescue.

183
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:21,030
我很抱歉  老兄...
I'm sorry, brother...

184
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:24,032
但这一次...
but this time...

185
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:29,004
你必须得死
This time you have to die.

186
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:40,015
来啊!
Come on!

187
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:45,044
来啊 Charlie  跳进来!
Come on, Charlie. Jump in!

188
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,087
我会接着你的  孩子
I'm gonna catch you, boy.

189
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:50,016
不  你会松手的
No. You're just going to back away.

190
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:53,086
别傻了  跳进来啊!
Don't be daft. Jump in!

191
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:57,028
我保证 Charlie  我会接着你的
I promise, Charlie. I'm gonna catch you.

192
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,003
不  他不会的!
No, he won't!

193
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:01,052
你给我闭嘴
Zip it, you.

194
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:03,066
别听你兄弟瞎说
Look, don't listen to your brother.

195
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:06,073
跳进来吧
Just jump on in.

196
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:11,041
没什么好害怕的 Charlie
There's nothing to be afraid of,Charlie.

197
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:15,059
我保证会接着你的
I'll catch you. I promise.

198
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,043
我做到了!
I did it!

199
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,062
你做到了!
You got it!

200
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:45,020
-我做到了     -你在游泳 Charlie
-I did it.      -You're swimming, Charlie.

201
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:54,090
你在写什么?
What you writing?

202
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:03,085
没什么
Nothing.

203
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,066
好吧  告诉我
All right, tell me.

204
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,046
你确定吗?
Are you sure you want to know?

205
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:21,007
如果那样会好受点...
I mean, it might be easier if you just...

206
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:24,027
我想知道
I want to know.

207
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:27,071
你在一个舱里
You're inside a hatch.

208
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:30,030
那里...
It's...

209
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,074
有很多仪器设备
a room full of equipment.

210
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:36,070
有个闪着黄灯的开关
There's a blinking yellow light above a switch.

211
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,092
你扳动了开关
You flip the switch.

212
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,019
灯就灭了
Light goes off.

213
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,043
然后你就被淹死了
And then you drown.

214
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,019
在什么时候?
When?

215
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:06,011
我也不知道
I don't know.

216
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:08,086
你确定看见Claire和Aaron 登上直升机了吗?
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron get on that helicopter?

217
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,087
是的
Aye.

218
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:15,062
那么...
So...

219
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:19,083
在我淹死之前
before I... drown...

220
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:23,044
我就扳了那个开关?
I just have to flip a switch?

221
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,063
是这样的
That's right.

222
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:32,031
那个地方在哪里?
Where is it, then?

223
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:36,099
这就是"守望镜"
Now this is the Looking Glass.

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,093
是一个水下的达摩站
It's an underwater Dharma station.

225
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:42,018
能告诉我你所知道的吗?
Please, can you tell me anything you might know about this place?

226
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,084
我从来没下去过
I've never been down there.

227
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:45,099
我也不知道谁下去过
I don't know anyone who has.

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,057
怎么会?
Why not?

229
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,053
因为发生了意外
There was some accident.

230
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:51,099
Ben告诉我们那个站 已经被淹了
Ben told us that the station was completely flooded.

231
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,018
如果被淹了 怎么还能工作?
Well, if it's flooded,then how does it still work?

232
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,086
怎么工作的并不重要
How it still works is irrelevant.

233
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:58,030
问题在于我们怎么下去 让它停止工作
The question is, how do we get it to stop working,

234
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:02,001
然后用我们的卫星电话
so we could use the satellite phone?

235
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,066
这张图表示"守望镜"
The diagram shows that the Looking Glass

236
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,030
和这座岛 以一根电缆相连
is connected to the island by a cable.

237
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:09,030
我相信这和那根...
I feel sure that this is the very same cable

238
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,079
深入海里的电缆是同一条
down the beach which runs into the ocean.

239
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,070
所以我们顺着这条电缆 就能找到那个站
So if we follow the cable,it should lead us to the station.

240
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,047
那我们怎么进去?
So how are we gonna get in?

241
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:17,085
游泳进去
We swim in.

242
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:20,026
那里有个小潭...
There's a moon pool...

243
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,079
在站下有个地面敞开的房间...
A room with an open floor at the base of the station...

244
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,001
大到能让一艘 潜艇停泊
Big enough for a submarine to dock.

245
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:27,021
即使站已经被淹了
Even if the station's flooded,

246
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:29,085
我想还是有办法找到开关 来解除阻隔信号
I think I'll be able to find the relay switch and disable it.

247
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:33,044
那怎么游出来呢?
What about swimming back out?

248
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,099
我不会让你去执行 什么自杀任务的
No. I'm not letting you go on some suicide mission

249
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,031
只是扳个开关
just to flip the switch.

250
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:40,081
总要有人去做 否则我们永远别想离开这里
Someone has to do it,or we'll never leave this island.

251
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:42,032
我来吧
I'll do it.

252
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:44,083
我能游下去  扳下那个开关 然后游上来
I can swim down, turn off that bloody switch, swim back up.

253
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,088
小菜一碟
Piece of cake.

254
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,017
Charlie你根本不知道 我们在说什么
Charlie, you don't even know what we're talking about.

255
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,047
我可是北英格兰 少年组游泳冠军
I was junior swim champion in northern England.

256
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:51,094
我闭气能达到4分钟
I can hold my breath for 4 minutes.

257
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:55,074
我知道你们在说什么
I know exactly what you're talking about.

258
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:00,065
不  现在我们还没必要做这个
No, and there's no reason to do this now.

259
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,024
我们得把精力放在"the others"上 然后再来处理这件事
We're gonna focus on the others,and then we'll deal with this.

260
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,066
等等 我们有机会发信号出去
Wait a minute.We have a chance to signal for a rescue.

261
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:09,098
90天来大家都要我 做出决定
Look, for 90 days, I've been asked to make decisions for this entire camp.

262
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:13,065
很好  我刚就做了一个
There you go.I just made one.

263
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,038
Rose 那是个"水手结"
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.

264
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,018
绑不紧的 你要像我这样弯一下
It's not gonna hold.You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.

265
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,050
那你是个打结专家咯?
Oh, so now you're a knot expert.

266
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:31,084
相信我  这...
Well, trust me, it's...

267
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,098
你是怎么做到的?
How did you do that?

268
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:40,040
边观察边学习  亲爱的
Watch and learn, dear.

269
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,040
你要等到什么时候 才告诉我?

270
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,040
拜托了 Sun

271
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,039
我听见Juliet的磁带上 有你我的名字

272
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,040
大家都看着你

273
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,040
是怀孕的事吗?

274
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,039
我看见我们的孩子了

275
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,088
在超声波仪器里

276
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,089
Juliet带我去了那个医疗站

277
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:28,088
而且她...

278
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,023
孩子还好吗?

279
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:34,024
非常非常的健康

280
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,086
看那边! 看啊!
Look there! Look!

281
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,009
该死的  放开他! 没关系的
Get off him, damn it! It's okay.

282
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,085

-What? He's one of them!   -I know! It's okay.

283
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:11,012
他被关在我旁边 的笼子里
He was in the cage next to me.

284
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,000
我认识这家伙
I know this guy.

285
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:15,058
你来这里干什么 Karl?
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

286
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,084
他们...来了...

287
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:18,093
我的人

抱歉你大老远的过来白说一通 我们已经知道了
Sorry you came all this way for nothing,but we already know.

289
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,089
那你们为什么还在这里?
Then why are you still here?

290
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,080
因为当他们明晚来的时候 我们会做好充分的准备
'cause when they'll show up tomorrow night, we're gonna be ready for'em.

291
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:30,087
明天?  不不 他们今晚就来!
Tomorrow? No, no,they're coming tonight.

292
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,026
他们现在就来了!
They're coming right now!

293
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:46,050

在他的帐篷里  你...

301
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:12,087
是时候行动了
It's time to get them.

302
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,045
但你说是明天
But you said tomorrow.

303
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:16,095
这是Jacob的决定
Jacob wants it to happen now.

304
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,026
那里发生了什么事?
Look, what happened out there?

307
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,042
是?
Yes, sir?

308
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:26,057
如果你们现在就出发
If you leave right now,

309
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:28,099
到他们的营地要多久?
how long will it take you to reach their camp?

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,090
如果我带上我的10个精英 黄昏就能发起攻击
Well,if I take my ten best,we could set up to hit'em by nightfall.

311
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:34,015
-那你们最好现在就出发    -Ben等一下

改变计划...
Moving up the schedule...

313
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,057
Juliet也许还没准备好 如果她没有时间...
Juliet may not be ready.What if she hasn't had time...

314
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:41,000
那我们就把所有的女人 都带走...
Then we'll take all their women...

315
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:43,050
然后再找出我们想要的
And we'll sort out the ones we need later.

316
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:44,084
男人呢?
And the men?

317
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:47,082
如果他们挡你的道的话
If any of'em are stupid enough to get in your way,

318
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,081
杀了他们
kill'em.

319
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:52,083
好吧
All right.

320
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:06,029
Karl!

321
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:09,084
是我!
It's me!

322
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:12,056
还以为你带兔子来了
I thought you were bringing rabbit.

323
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:15,001
你现在就得走

324
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:17,020
什么  他发现我在这里了吗?
What? Did he find out I was out here?

325
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:19,070
不  但他已经派Pryce 去他们的营地了
No, but he's sending Pryce to their beach camp right now,

326
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:20,085
你必须去警告他们

00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:22,028
-警告他们?    -你必须现在就去!
-Warn them?     -You have to go now!

328
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,052
我以为他们只是去 抓孕妇
I thought they were just gonna take the pregnant women.

329
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:25,057
如果你坐木筏去
If you take the outrigger,

330
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:27,060
你就能在他们之前到那儿
you'll get there a few hours before them.

331
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:31,096
-等等 Alex...  -他会杀光他们的 Karl!

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,067
Austen和Ford救了你的命
Austen and Ford saved your life.

333
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,059
你欠他们的
You owe them.

00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,075
最好带上这个

00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:51,039
如果我这次被抓住 你爸爸会杀了我的

337
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:05,021

就这些了吗?
Is that everything?

339
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,016
我们能相信他吗?
Can we trust him?

340
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,043
你不相信我?
You don't trust me?

341
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:37,093
那她呢?
What about her?

342
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:40,021
她是个间谍
She's a spy.

343
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:43,050
她会在孕妇帐篷外 用白色石头做标记的
She's supposed to mark the tents of the pregnant women with white rocks

344
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:47,094

-so they can take them.    -They know, Karl, but thanks.

345
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:50,074
-那我们现在怎么办?    -我们必须现在就走...躲起来
-So what are we gonna do?   -We have to leave now... Hide.

346
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:55,057
去哪儿?  这是他们的岛 他们想杀我们就一定能找到我们
Where? It's their island. If they wanna kill us,they'll find us.

347
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:58,027
几小时后就日落了
The sun's gonna go down in a few hours.

348
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:00,089
-我的导线准备的怎样了?   -还差的很远
-Do we have enough wire yet?    -Not even close.

349
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,033
我们必须另想办法 来引爆炸药
We have to find out another way to set the dynamite off.

-We can shoot.   -We don't have enough guns.

他们有10个人 都带着武器
Ten of them are coming, armed.

352
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:08,017
不是"the others"... 是帐篷
Not the others... the tents.

353
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,043
我们把炸药隐藏 在帐篷的旁边
We can camouflage the dynamite next to the tents,

354
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:14,061
我们能在树林里 瞄准它们
target it from our positions at the tree line.

355
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:18,092
Juliet给3个帐篷做了标记 我们需要3把枪

I'll take your gun,but you're not staying here.

359
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,096

You're gonna lead everyone to the radio tower... Everyone.

360
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,012
无线电塔?
The radio tower?

361
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:36,039
如果行动失败的话 我们不能冒险失去
If this doesn't work,we can't risk losing the chance

364
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,074

Yes. I think so, yes.

433
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,095

抱歉我"心脏病"又犯了

Well, that makes you even more of a hero, doesn't it?

438
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:21,082
换作别人也会这样做的
I just did what anyone would do.

439
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:25,019
3个人路过这里
Three people walked by the alley.

440
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,004
-什么?   -他们看见我了
-What?    -They saw me,

441

你是个英雄  先生...
You are a hero, sir...

443
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:39,038

448
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,000
-那是什么?    -重量带
-What's that?   -It's a weight belt.

449
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,074
它能很快把你带到那里
It should bring you down quicker than swimming.

450
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:03,006
每秒都很重要
Well, every second counts.

451
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,063
那么我到了海底就松开它们
So I just take it off when I hit bottom,

452
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:07,069
然后游到那个小潭

453
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,089
进入那个站
into the station,

找到一个有黄灯的开关
swim into whichever room has the yellow blinking switch,

455
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:18,023
然后扳一下
flip it.

456
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:21,063
就这么简单?
Nothing to it.

457
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:29,042
你能闭气多久?
So how long can you really hold your breath for?

458
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:32,064
这还重要吗?
Does it matter?

459
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,049
-想要我再打一个吗?   -不  我想你能做到
-Do you want me to hit another one?    -No,you've made your point.
