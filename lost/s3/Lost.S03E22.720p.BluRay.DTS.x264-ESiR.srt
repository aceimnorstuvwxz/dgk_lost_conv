If I told you that I'd help you with your "S.O.S." sign,would you change your mind?

和Jack待在一起 如果累了就停下来休息

45
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,000
Jin...

46
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
你为什么要这样做?

47
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:40,001
因为...我们要...回家
Because...we have... to go... home.

48
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:58,071
好了
Alright.

我们出发吧!
Let's do it.

50
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,080
Jack 能问你个问题吗?
Jack,can I ask you a question?

51
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,073
当然
Sure

52
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:23,099
在你变成土著人之前 你是干什么的?
What did you do for a living before you became Moses?

53
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,018
我是一个医生
I was a doctor.

54
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:28,001
那当然咯
Right. 'course you were.

55
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,021
我想让你看看这个  医生
Well, I need your attention for a minute, doctor.

56
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:35,060
她没关系吧?
Is she okay?

57
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,079
为什么这样说?
Why wouldn't she be?

58
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,011
因为大家都不信任她
Because none of your people trusts her.

59
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:41,066
我不是针对你
No offense.

60
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:43,075
那我先走了 你们慢慢跟上
Why don't you catch up to me when you're done?

61
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:45,095
-Juliet...  -没关系的
-Juliet...  -It's fine.

62
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:53,070
我想让你知道这小玩意是怎么用的 如果我发生了什么事
So I need to show you how this wonderful gadget works,in case anything happens to me.

63
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:56,065
你可以使用它来 联络我的船
You need to be able to call my boat.

64
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,038
好啊
Okay. Show me.

65
00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:59,038
当然也很简单
It's actually simple.

66
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:00,099
按这里打开
Turn her on here.

67
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,076
这个将打开 连通货船的直接频道
This opens a direct channel to the freighter.

68
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:05,095
按这里  然后听到拨号音...
Give her a tap here. Wait for the beep

69
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:07,086
你就可以说话了
and say hello.

70
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:09,087
没错
That's it.

71
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:13,005
一旦摇滚巨星把水下的 那个阻挠系统关闭...
Once the rock star turns off whatever underwater contraption is jamming us up,

72
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:16,050
这个红色的灯就会变绿
this red light will turn a lovely shade of green.

73
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,050
这随时都会发生 是吗?
That'll be any time now, yeah?

74
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:22,032
希望如此
Hopefully.

75
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,087
你是谁?
Who are you?

76
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,033
如果你告诉我们你是 怎么下来的  我们就不会伤害你
If you tell us how you got down here,we won't hurt you.

77
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:44,005
我乘着隐型潜艇来
I came in my invisible submarine.

78
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:45,082
你看不出来吗?
Don't you see it?

79
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,047
你冷静点!
Take it easy.

80
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:50,022
冷静?  他是他们的人
Take it easy? He's one of them.

81
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,048
你为什么来这里?
Why are you here?

82
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:55,060
你是怎么知道这个站的?
How did you find out about this station?

83
00:10:57,065 --> 00:11:00,038
Juliet告诉我们的
Juliet told us.

84
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:02,074
她现在和我们是一伙的了
She's one of us now.

85
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:05,010
你没有听说吗?
In case you haven't heard.

86
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,014
住手!
Stop!

87
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:11,001
我们通知Ben吧
We gotta call Ben.

88
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:15,053
你最好通知Ben
Let's call Ben.

89
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:19,072

Come on.

90
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,046
有个装着很多仪器的房间
You're inside a room full of equipment.

91
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:37,071
有个闪着黄灯的开关
There's a blinking yellow light above a switch.

92
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,076
你扳动了开关 灯就灭了
You flick the switch.Light goes off.

93
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:45,002
然后你就被淹死了...
And you drown...

94
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:57,005

Can you hear me?

97
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:09,010

Why are you breaking radio silence?

98

他们中的一个人在这里
One of them's down here.

99
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,081

We've got him tied up, but he's here.One of them swam down here.

101
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:17,011
谁?  哪个人?
Who? Which one?

102
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:18,031
他不肯告诉我们
He won't tell us.

103
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:21,070
Charlie!  向Ben问声好
It's Charlie! Tell him I said hi!

104
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,094
他是怎么知道那里的?
How did...How does he know about the station.

105
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:27,063
他说Juliet告诉他的
He said Juliet told them.

106
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:38,011
待着别动  别做任何事 我去叫增援
All right, sit tight. Don't do anything.I'm sending help.

107
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:42,057
Mikhail 你下去那里 查清Charlie在那里干什么
You need to go down to the Looking Glass
and find out what Charlie Pace is doing down there.

108
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:44,063
你告诉我们"守望镜" 已经被毁了...
You told us the Looking Glass was inoperable...

109

110
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:48,037

黄昏前应该能到
I can be there by dawn.

113
00:12:55,008 --> 00:13:00,039
如果Juliet告诉他们"守望镜"  她还会告诉他们什么?
But if Juliet told them about the Looking Glass,what else did she tell them?

114
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,098
Ryan 你听到吗...

应该有三次爆炸才对
There were supposed to be three explosions.

130
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:46,019

00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,021
一起车祸
a car accident.

143
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,017
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

144
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:49,055
是的  我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

145
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:53,017
你又喝多了吧?
Were you drinking again?

146
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,071
-是吗 Jack?  -没有!
-Are you, Jack?  -No.

147
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,051
你为什么来这里 Sarah?
Why did you come down here, Sarah?

148
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:08,076
我还是你的紧急联系人
I'm still listed as your emergency contact.

149
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:17,082
你当时在做什么 凌晨两点还在外面开车?
What were you doing driving around at 2:00 in the morning?

150
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:39,023
你能载我回家吗?
Maybe you could give me a lift home?

151
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,024
我想这不大合适
I don't think that would be appropriate.

152
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:48,060
是啊...
yeah...

153
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:52,008
那...
Well...

154
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:57,003
谢谢你来这里 Sarah
Thanks for coming down,Sarah.

155
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,074
再见 Jack
Goodbye,Jack.

156
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:17,025
为什么只有两次爆炸?
Why were there only two explosions?

157
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,012
也许他们不需要引爆 第三个帐篷
Maybe they didn't have to blow the 3rd tent.

158
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:21,052
-但那里枪声是怎么回事?  -他不会有事的 Rose
But those gunshots...What was that about?  -He's okay.

159
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:22,078
你这么认为吗?
Do you believe that?

160
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:26,042
他们根本毫无防备
Listen,they had no idea that we were waiting for them,

161
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,091
而且Sayid也和他们在一起 他们会没事的  几小时后就能赶上我们
and Sayid's with your husbands.They're gonna
 be fine,and they're gonna be a couple hours behind us.

162
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:33,095
-那我们等在这里  你先走...  -不行!
-We should wait for them here.You go...  -No.

163
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,005
谁也不能留在这里
No one gets left behind.

164
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:40,057
如果你对我说"同生独死"的话 Jack  我会给你一巴掌
If you say,"live together, die alone" to me,I'm gonna punch you in your face.

165
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,002
这很公平 Rose
Fair enough, Rose.

166
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,053
这很公平
Fair enough.

167
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:47,098
但我们有计划
But we have a plan!

168
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:50,021
我们现在知道  我们成功了
And for all we know, it worked.

169
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:54,065
没事的  会好起来的
It's gonna be okay.Everything is gonna be all right.

170
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,016
我们继续前进好吗?
Let's just keep moving, okay?

171
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:12,055
没关系的  我们走...
It's okay. Let's go.

172
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:22,033
我再问你一遍
I'm gonna ask you this one more time.

173
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,083
你为什么来这里?
Why are you here?

174
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,084
我来这里...
I'm here...

175
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:33,092
是来关掉你们的阻挠系统 就在那个黄灯的旁边
to turn off your jamming equipment.In there,next to the flashing yellow light.

176
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:37,003
-你是怎么知道这些的?  -我就是知道呗
-Now how'd you know about that?  -I know because I know.

177
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:40,057
不管你们想对我怎么样 我都要关了它
Whatever you ladies do to me,I'm going to turn it off.

178
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:42,044
- 是吗?  - 一点没错
- You are, huh?   - Most definitely am.

179
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:44,067
那密码是什么?
So what's the code?

180
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,083
什么?
What?

181
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:50,092
如果你想要关掉它 你还需要一个密码
If you're gonna turn off the jamming equipment,you're gonna need the code,

182
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:56,042

and only three people know it. Me,her and Ben.

183
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:03,009
那...
Well...

184
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:08,078
我不需要什么密码 当这个站被淹掉后...
Guess I won't need the code...Since this entire station's gonna be flooded anyway.

185
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,061
只要关掉那个开关 直升机就会来救我的朋友了
Now just turn off your little jammer,and the
helicopters come and rescue all my friends.

186
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:18,062
如果这个站淹了...
But if this station floods,

187
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:21,042
那你又会怎么样?
what happens to you?

188
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,065
我死了呗...

是吗?  为什么?
Really? And why not?

236
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,080

我会和他们谈妥的

-What'd you do that for?  -To wake you up.

268
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,089
自从你从Locke那边回来 你就像梦游一样
Ever since you got that tape from Lock,it's like you've been sleepwalking.

269
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,060
你不在乎我们的朋友 那没关系
You don't care about our friends, fine,

270
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,079
但你好像什么都不在乎了
but it's like you don't care about anything anymore.

271
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,059
还有从什么时候开始 你叫我"Kate"了?
And since when did you start calling me "Kate"?

277
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,080
Des!  Des!

278
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,000
妈的 你还好吗?
Bloody hell. You all right?

279
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,080
如果你不走 我就惨了
Not for long if you don't get out of here.

280
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,070
你必须躲起来Des  快躲起来 那里面有人
You have to hide.There's people in there.

281
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,010
快藏起来  快快快快!!
Quick, hide, hide!

282
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,079
他在和谁说话?
Who's he talking to?

283
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,060
"Acting like it's stupid stupid people wearing..."

284
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,070
你在和谁说话?
Who were you talking to?

285
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,090
没有啊
Wasn't talking to anyone.

286
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,010
我只是在唱歌
I was just singing.

287
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,060
"You all everybody"

288
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,069
"You all everybody"

289
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,030
"You all everybody"

290
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,029
"You all everybody"

291
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,030
闭嘴
Shut up.

292
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,029
好吧
Right, okay. You got it.

293
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,029
进来
Come on.

294
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,079
需要帮助吗?
Can I help you?

295
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,060
只是在看她的受伤状况
Just checking her chart.

296
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,060
抱歉  我是Hamill Rob医生
I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill...Rob.

297
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,090
我是这里的新外科主任医师 我想我们还没见过面
The new chief of surgery. I don't think we've met yet.

298
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,030
Jack  Shephard

299
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,090
Shephard医生 那个英雄
Dr. Shephard, the hero...

300
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,029
已经两次了
Twice over.

301
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,070
你还好吗?
You all right?

302
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,029
经过昨晚这么一折腾 你还来继续工作啊
After last night,I'm surprised you'd even wanna come in.

303
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,090
说起正确的时间地点
Talk about right place, right time, huh?

304
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,070
这个女人很幸运有你在场
This woman is very lucky you were there.

305
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,070
如果她够幸运 她的背就不会骨折了
If she was lucky,she wouldn't have a fractured back

306
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,020
她的脊椎受到了严重的外伤
that was impinging upon her spinal cord.

307
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,079
我想一早就给她做手术
I'd like to...operate first thing in the morning.

308
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,090
你想做手术?
You wanna operate?

309
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,010
是的
Yes.

310
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,020
很抱歉  但她不是你的病人
I'm sorry, but this isn't your patient,

311
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:29,049
她的情况我们都了解  Gary Nadler 6点会给她做手术
and we are well aware of the issues.Gary Nadler's doing the surgery at 6:00 a.m.

312
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,000
请恕我直言
With all due respect...

313
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,099
Hamill医生  但我还是 想自己来做
Dr.Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.

314
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,030
昨晚
Last night,

315
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,070
你把这个女人8岁的孩子 从着火的车里拉了出来
you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son out of a flaming car,

316
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,089
然后又跑去救她
then you went back for her.

317
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,040
我想你做的够多的了
I think you've done enough.

318
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,049
我想做这次手术
I wanna do the surgery.

319
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,060
一切都在掌握之中
Look, everything's under control here.

320
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,020
她会没事的
She'll be fine.

321
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,060
回家吧
Go home.

322
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,080
去喝一杯
Have a drink.

323
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,059
这是你应得的
You deserve it.

324
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,089
情况表 Jack
The chart, please.

325
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,080
你随时打电话给我
You call me.

326
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,099
我想了解情况
I wanna know what happens.

327
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,000
今晨  第6大街的这座桥 被关闭了几小时
This morning,the bridge of six avenue was shut down for several hours

328
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,090
这里发生了车祸 有两名伤者
in the wake of a fiery car accident that left two injured.

329
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,030
一名40岁的女士和她的儿子
An unidentified 40-year-old woman and her son.

330
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,090
他们很幸运
Fortunately for the two of them,

331
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,010
Jack Shephard医生就在现场
Dr.Jack Shephard was near the scene of the crash

332
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,080
他把两个人拉出了 着火的车子
and pulled both victims from the burning wreckage

333
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,000
然后对他们进行了急救 直到救护车的到来
and treated them at the scene until paramedics arrived.

334
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,050
伤者稍后被转到St.Sebastian医院
The victims were later transported to St. Sebastian hospital.

335
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,009
目前还没有最新情况
Further details of their conditions have not yet been released.

336
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,070
我回去吧
I'm going back.

337
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,060
什么?
What?

338
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,010
我回去海滩那里
I'm going back to the beach.

339
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,000
这不行
No way.

340
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,020
我们得继续前进
We keep moving.

341
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,039
我可不指望得到许可
I ain't asking permission.

342
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,080
你有事要做
Look, you got a job to do here.

343
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,050
我不会碍事的 你在这里也不需要我
I ain't gonna stand in your way of doing it,but you sure as hell don't need me.

344
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,060
你认为你孤身一人 又不带武器过去 能够搞定?
What do you think you're gonna get done,alone and unarmed?

345
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,040
-我和他一起去  -不行
-He won't be alone.I'll go with him.  -No.

346
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,080
20分钟前你还不想回去
20 mins ago,you weren't even interested in going,

347
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,060
-现在你突然告诉Jack...  -我不想和你一起去
-and now all of a sudden,you're telling Jack...  -I didn't wanna go with you.

348
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,070
没枪的话就只是去送死
It's a suicide mission without guns.

349
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,030
我知道哪里有枪
I know where there are some guns.

350
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,050
离这里几英里的地方 有个隐藏地点
There's a hidden cache a couple of miles from here.

351
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,090
我们去海滩的路上 能顺便去下那里
I can take us back to the beach on a route past it.

352
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,070
Juliet 你不必这么做的
Juliet, you don't have to do that.

353
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,060
是的 Jack  我要这么做
Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.

354
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,080
我们走吧
Let's do this.

355
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,050
别干傻事
Don't do anything stupid.

356
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,050
如果你不做的话
I won't if you won't.

357
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,040
别等我们
Don't wait up.

358
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:55,000
我叫你闭嘴!
I told you to shut up!

359
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,040
你知道一个曲子 一直萦绕在脑海里
You know how you get a tune stuck in your head?

360
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,060
这首歌就会让你 有灵感了
This song...It just started coming to me.

361
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,000
如果找到桥的话 就完成了
It's almost finished.Just need to find the bridge.

362
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,060
-拿叉枪来  -什么? 为什么?
-Get the speargun.  -What? Why?

363
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,070
因为我想搞点伤害
'Cause I want it to hurt.

364
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,060
-不  Ben说我们...  -你不去  我去
-No, Ben said we...  -You don't wanna get it? I will.

365
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,050
Bonnie

366
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,070
好好好  我闭嘴!
No. I'll... I'll shut up!

367
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,080
我闭嘴!  一定闭嘴!
I'll shut up,I'll shut up

368
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,040
Mikhail?

369
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,000
我还以为你们在加拿大
I thought you two were on assignment in Canada.

370
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
他让我们承诺不告诉任何人
He made us promise not to tell anyone.

371
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,010
-你好啊   -另一个人在哪里?
-Hello again.  -Where is the other one?

372
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,040
-什么?  -那个白痴跳下了船
-What?  -This idiot swam down from a boat.

373
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,000
我刚向他的朋友开了枪
I was just shooting at his friend.

374
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,090
他潜水下来了 只有他一个人
He dove down here. He's alone.

375
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,080
你确定吗?
Are you sure about that?

376
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,040
我有个更好的问题  电磁人
Here's a better question to ask, Cyclops.

377
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:55,010
为什么你们的小朋友Ben 告诉你们这个站被淹了?
Why did your little friend Ben tell you people that this entire station was flooded when it isn't?

378
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,090
还有为什么这两个人 一直在阻挠这里的信号?
Or, why these two have been jamming transmissions off the island?

379
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,030
什么?
What?

380
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,090
是真的吗?
Is that true?

381
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,030
-那是Ben  -我来和他说
-That's Ben.  -I'll get it.

382
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,070
你要明白  我做的一切 都是为了这座岛
You have to understand.Everything I did,I did for the island.

383
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:19,010
这座岛告诉你你能 欺骗自己的人吗?
The island told you it was necessary for you to jam your own people?

384
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,070
我也没办法
Yes, it did.

385
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,020
你一直都很忠诚 Mikhail 现在你要相信我
You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail.Now I'm asking you to trust me,

386
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,000
相信Jacob  是他 告诉我这样做的
to trust Jacob who told me to do that.

387
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,050
Jacob让你对自己人撒谎?
Why would Jacob ask you to lie to your own people?

388
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:35,030
因为这座岛一直受到强大力量 的袭击  未来我们也必须这样做
cos this island's under assault by
 forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many,many years,

389
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,060
所以我们要保护它  不惜一切代价
and we are meant to protect it,by any means necessary.

390
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,010
阻挠信号是为了大家的安全
The jamming was for everyone's security.

391
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,060
我们的处境很危险
We are in a serious situation here.

392
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,060
为什么不信任我?
So why not trust me?

393
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,080
我犯了个错误
I made a mistake.

394
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,060
我应该告诉你的 我向你道歉
I should have told you, and I apologize.

395
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,020
Mikhail 你还在吗?
Mikhail, are you still there?

396
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,000
是的
Yes.

397
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,070
我需要你的帮助
I need you to help me.

398
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,060
我要你弥补我的过失
I need you to help me clean up this mess that I've made.

399
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,010
我要你杀了Charlie
I need you to kill Charlie.

400
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,050
确保干扰设备继续正常运转
Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all cost.

401
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,070
我们不能冒险让Greta和Bonnie 告诉其他人这件事
And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others what we've done,

402
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,040
所以把他们也一起解决了
so you'll have to take care of them, too.

403
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
我怎么才能相信你对 他们说的也是这一套?
How do I know you didn't say the same thing to them about me?

404
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:46,010
因为我说了的话 Mikhail 你早就没命了
Because if I had, Mikhail...you'd already be dead.

405
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:10,035
你还好吗?
You okay?

406
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,002
没事  只是...
Yeah, I just...

407
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:15,056
鞋里有块石头
got a rock in my shoe.

408
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:27,013
他不是那个意思
He didt mean it, you know.

409
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:31,048
-什么?  -Sawyer
-What?  -Sawyer.

410
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:34,079
他说他不想跟你一起回去 他不是那个意思
When he said that he didn't want you to go with him... he didn't mean it.

411
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,077
如果他不是那个意思 他干嘛那么说?
If he didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

412
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:41,001
他只是想保护你
He was trying to protect you.

413
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,090
这也就是我叫你 别回来找我的原因
That's why I asked you not to come back for me.

414
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:56,047
你干嘛要替Sawyer说话?
Why are you sticking up for Sawyer?

415
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,022
他绝不会替你说话
He'd never do it for you.

416
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:06,075
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

417
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:33,040
把我们赶出关熊的笼子 然后把我们锁在一起
Out of those polar bear cages and put us on the chain gang,

418
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,080
还有为什么让我们 打碎那些石头呢?
what the hell did you have us breaking all those rocks for, anyway?

419
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,020
我们在建跑道
We were building a runway.

420
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,070
跑道?  干嘛用的?
A runway? For what?

421
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,000
那些外星人
The aliens.

422
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,080
我也不知道 你以为他们什么都告诉我吗?
I don't know what for.Do you think they told me everything?

423
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,060
随便你说吧
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

424
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,060
-你和Jack上过床了吗?  -没有
-So you screwing Jack yet?  -No.

425
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,080
你呢?
Are you?

426
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,090
离那些枪还有多远?
How far away are these guns?

427
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,040
根本没什么枪
There aren't any guns.

428
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,030
什么?
What?

429
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,030
-我撒了谎  -你撒谎
-I lied.  -You lied.

430
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,040
这是他能让我们 回来的唯一借口
It was the only way he'd let us go back.

431
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,060
你为什么要回来
So why are you going back?

432
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,080
因果报应吧
Karma.

433
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,020
你又什么要回来呢 James?
Why are you going back, James?

434
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,000
伙计们  等一下!
Hey, guys! Wait up!

435
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,070
你想干什么?
What the hell do you want?

436
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,030
我想和你们一起去
I'm coming with you guys.

437
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,050
不行
No way. Not a chance.

438
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,030
拜托  我能帮上忙的
Come on. I can help.

439
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,040
他们也是我的朋友
They're my friends, too, man.

440
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Charlie不肯让我和他们去
Charlie wouldn't let me go with him,

441
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,090
Jack在那边忙得没空和我说话
and Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me.

442
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,040
我只是想帮下忙  好吗?
I just wanna help. Please?

443
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:55,080
看在上帝的份上Hugo  瞧瞧你 你只会拖累我们
For God sakes, Hugo, look at you!You're just gonna get in the way.

444
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,030
你想让我们全死啊?
You wanna get us killed?

445
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,030
走吧
Come on.

446
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,040
如果我们朝北走 我们可以在他们之前到塔那里
If we head north,we should get to them before they reach the tower.

447
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,070
为什么让我一起来?
Why did you let me come?

448
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,010
我让你来是想把你 交托给一个新的家庭
I let you come because I'm delivering you to your new family.

449
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,040
我让你来是因为你背叛了我
I let you come because you betrayed me.

450
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,010
你把Karl关在笼子里
You locked Karl in a cage.

451
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,090
还把他关在那个房间里 给他洗脑
You put him in a room and tried to brainwash him.

452
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,010
我不想让你怀孕
I didn't want him to get you pregnant.

453
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,050
我想我反应过度了
I suppose I overreacted.

454
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,050
我们最好现在就上路 
We'd better get going.

455
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,080
你为什么要阻止他们?
Why do you have to stop them?

456
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,000
就不能让他们走吗?
Why won't you just let them leave?

457
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,000
因为我不能 Alex
Because I can't, Alex.

458
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,060
别这样 John
Don't, John.

459
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,050
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

460
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,040
-Walt?  -起来John
-Walt?  -Now get up, John.

461
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:05,050
他朝我开枪 我的腿动不了了
He shot me, and I can't...move my legs.

462
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,010
你能的
You can move your legs.

463
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,030
快从坑里爬起来
Now get out of the ditch.

464
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,030
为什么?
Why?

465
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,070
因为你还有事要去做
Because you have work to do.
