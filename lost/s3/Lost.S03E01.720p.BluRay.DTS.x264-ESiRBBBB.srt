00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,074
剧情回顾...
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:05,076
这不是你们的岛
This is not your island.

3
00:00:05,076 --> 00:00:07,000
这是我们的岛
This is our island.

4
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:12,055
他们攻击我们  分裂我们   绑架我们  谋杀我们
They've attacked us,sabotaged us,abducted us,murdered us.

5
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:16,026
我们都知道这个岛上还有其他人
We're not the only people on this island,and we all know it!

6
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:19,020
第一晚他们来  抓走了三个人
They came the first night,took three of us,

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,005
第二次  又抓走了九个人
then they came back and took nine more.

8
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,063
他们聪明而且凶残
They're smart,and they're animals.

9
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:28,089
你们跟我们走
You're coming with us.

10
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:53,086
When you're alone

11
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,005
and life is making you lonely

12
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,063
You can always go…

13
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,045
Downtown…

14
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:03,081
When you've go worries all the noise and the hurry

15
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:06,072
seems to help I know…

16
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,024
Downtown…

17
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:12,037
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city

18
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:16,055
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

19
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:19,029
How can you lose

20
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:22,038
The lights are much brighter there

21
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:24,065
You can forget all your troubles

22
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:26,037
Forget all your cares

23
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,095
so go downtown

24
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:31,069
Things will be great when you're downtown…

25
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,066
No finer place for sure… downtown…

26
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,064
我把松饼烤焦了....还有我的手...
I burnt my hand...and my muffins.

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,081
还没修好吗?
Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?

28
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:47,002
工作正在进行中
It's a work in progress.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,013
这根本不是文学作品  只是部闲书
It's not even literature. It's popcorn.

30
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:51,091
为什么不是  Adam?
And why isn't it literature, Adam?

31
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,082
我很想知道
I'm dying to know.

32
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:53,077
里面没有比喻
There's no metaphor.

33
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:55,078
只有些数字和宗教传闻
It's by the numbers,religious hokum-pokum.

34
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:57,039
-没有比喻?     -这是科学小说
-No metaphor?  -It's science fiction.

35
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,096
现在我知道为什么Ben没有来
Now I know why Ben isn't here.

36
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:00,017
什么?
Excuse me?

37
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:05,006
我知道应该由主人选书  但是说实话  Juliet 他根本不会浪费时间看这本书
I know the host picks the book,but seriously,
Julie,he wouldn't read this in the damned bathroom.

38
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:13,007
Adam  我就是主人  我选了这本书 并且这本是我最喜欢的
Well,Adam,I am the host,and i do pick the book,and this,is my favorite book,

39
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:18,007
我真的相当"内疚"你不喜欢它
so I am absolutely thrilled that you can't stand it.

40
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:22,046
我很愚蠢  居然选择了Ben不会喜欢的东西
Silly me for sinking so low as to select something that Ben wouldn't like.

41
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:28,033
所以我想 大家还是可以自由的选择...
Here I am,thinking that free will still actually exists on...

42
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:31,085
去门口
In the doorway,get in the door way.

43
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:28,050
Goodwin

44
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,005
看到飞机尾部落在哪里了吗?
You see where the tail landed?

45
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,056
看到了  应该在海里
Yeah,probably in the water.

46
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:34,037
跑过去  一小时就能到海滩
You run,you can make that shore in 1 hour.

47
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:36,032
Ethan  去机身那里
Ethan,get up there to that fuselage.

48
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:39,089
应该会有幸存者  你就假装是他们的一员
There may actually be survivors,and you're one of them.

49
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,059
一个乘客  装得惊慌点
A passenger,you're in shock.

50
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,038
他们问起的话就编个故事
Come up with an adequate story if they ask.

51
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:44,062
没问你就不要说
Stay quiet if they don't.

52
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,003
边听边学  别搞砸了
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

53
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:48,069
三天内我要拿到乘客名单
I want list in three days.

54
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,078
快去
Go.

55
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:02,070
我想我已经退出图书俱乐部了
So I guess I'm out of the book club.

56
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,070
迷失

00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:19,044
你认为我会回答你这个问题吗?

你不和我说话吗?

Comforted that your friends were looking out at the same ocean.

我让你穿这身衣服让你看起来像位女士
I gave you the dress so you'd feel like a lady,

142
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:17,063

and I wanted you to eat your food with a real live fork and feel civilized.

143

我做这些事情让你心情愉快点
I did all those things so that you'd have something nice to hold on to.

144
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:28,024
因为  Kate...
Because,Kate...

145
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:34,027
接下来的两个星期会很不愉快
the next two weeks are going to be very unpleasant.

146
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:46,031
你好
Yeah, hi.

147
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:50,031
我在火车上遇到一个女人...Sarah
I met a woman on the train,Sarah,and,

148
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:53,021
我捡到了她的手机 但我不知道她姓什么
she dropped her cell phone,and I don't even know her last name,

149
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:57,066
但是我看到你的电话号码在她的手机里 所以我想...
but your number was in her phone,so I was just wondering...

150
00:17:57,066 --> 00:18:00,073
对不起  对不起  算了
I'm sorry,I'm sorry.Forget it.

151
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:04,002
等一下  爸爸
Just give me a minute,dad.

152
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,086
我不是让你等一下吗?
I asked you to give me a minute here.

153
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,020
这是什么?
What's this?

154
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,011
为什么你打这些Sarah手机上的电话?
Why are you dialing all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone?

155
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:15,069
因为他们当中有一个是和她在一起的男人
Because one of them is him.

156
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:17,031
你不能这样做 Jack
You gotta stop this,Jack.

157
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:18,025
已经结束了
It's over.

158
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:23,031
除非我知道他的名字  他在哪里工作  他住在哪里
Not until I know his name,where he works,where he lives.

159
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:24,034
他们在哪里第一次接吻
When they first kissed.

160
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:28,058
我想知道他是一个怎么样的人
I wanna know what it is about him.

161
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:40,028
爸爸  为什么Sarah会给你打电话?
Why is Sarah calling you,dad?

162
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:42,092
我觉得你应该就此罢手了
I think it's time that you let this go.

163
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:44,038
她为什么会给你打电话?
Why is she calling you?

164
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,009
-因为她担心你 - 爸爸...
-Because she was afraid...for you.  -Dad

165
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:50,041
我想清楚的知道她为什么会给你打电话
I wanna know exactly why the hell she would call you!

166
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,061
她看得出来你在逃避
She saw that you were slipping.

167
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,017
-你无法控制自己     -问题不是我能不能控制自己
-You were losing your grip.   -My grip is not the problem.

168
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:55,085
那正是现在发生这些事的原因
Which is exactly what's happening here.

169
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:57,071
算了吧 Jack
Jack! Come...

170
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,059
我认为你知道怎样让自己好点
I think I know a little something about being obsessive.

171
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:07,057
不  当一个酒鬼不是解决问题的办法
No,being a drunk is not obsessive.

172
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:22,028
放手吧 Jack
Let it go,Jack.

173
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:57,010
什么?
What?!

174
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:02,035
如果你是在和我说  那我听不见
If you're trying to talk to me,I can't hear you!

175
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,059
放手把 Jack
Let it go,Jack.

176
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,032
我知道你饿了
I know you're hungry.

177
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:12,050
我给你带了点吃的
I brought this for you.

178
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,074
现在我们这样
This is how it will work.

179
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:20,068
你坐在这里  背对着墙壁
You sit there,across from the door,back against the wall.

180
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:23,084
我把门打开留下盘子
I open the door and leave the tray.

181
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:27,082
我可以相信你吗?  Jack
Can I trust you to do that,Jack?

182
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:31,010
我不想要你的食物
I don't want your food.

183
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,034
这个三明治很可口...
It's a delicious sandwich...

184
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:38,011
我想你告诉对讲机那边的人  他可以放弃了
I want you to tell the guy who's talking to me through that intercom that he can give it up!

185
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,082
可能你现在真的很饿了
Maybe you're hungrier than you think.

186
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:43,088
那个对讲机已经坏了很多年了
That intercom hasn't worked in years.

187
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:45,063
那是什么?
What's that for?

188
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:48,014
那个按钮是用来干什么的?
The button-- what it's for?

189
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,031
是紧急时刻用的
It's for emergencies.

190
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:53,039
谁在监视我?
Who's watching me?

191
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,017
你能背靠着墙坐下吗? 这样我才能打开门
Are you going to sit against the wall so I can open the door?

192
00:20:56,017 --> 00:21:00,029
这个煎饼刚刚才烤好
It's...just off the frying pan.

193
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,074
你自己吃吧
You can have it.

194
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,064
你是干什么的 Jack?
What do you do,Jack?

195
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:12,059
你的职业是什么?
What's your profession?

196
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,001
我是讨债的
I'm a repo man.

197
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:20,096
当人们不能按时付款时 我代替银行收回他们赊款的东西
You know,when people don't pay their bills,I go in for the bank,and I collect their possessions.

198
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:23,074
我是一个有人性的人 所以我很喜欢这个工作
I'm a people person,so I really love it.

199
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,084
你结婚了吗?
Are you married?

200
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,089
没有
No

201
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:30,036
从来都没有机会
I never saw the point.

202
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,052
你呢?
What about you?

203
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:36,067
除了做三明治你还有什么工作?
What's your job,besides making sandwiches?

204
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,081
这不是我做的
I didn't make it.

205
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:41,031
我只是把牙签插上去
I just put the toothpicks in.

206
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:51,010
当你们的飞机坠毁时 你们是从哪里起飞的?
When your plane crashed,where were you flying from?

207
00:21:58,007 --> 00:22:00,014
悉尼
Sydney.

208
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:02,074
你在那里干什么?
What were you doing there?

209
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:05,000
我去把我爸爸带回家
I was bringing my father home.

210
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,003
-你走这么远的路只为了...    -因为他死了
-Why would you go all the way to Australia just to...  -because he was dead.

211
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:14,071
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

212
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,061
我知道
I'm sure you are.

213
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:21,030
谢谢
Thanks.

214
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:30,098
你可以相信我  Jack
You can trust me,Jack.

215
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,074
我不会伤害你
I'm not gonna hurt you.

216
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:46,054
这里到底发生了什么事?
What the hell is going on here?

217
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:19,069
从这里到你们的营地需要多长时间?
How long would it take to get to your camp?

218
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:23,078
你现在肯跟我说话了吗  小子?
What,you're talking to me now,Chachi?

219
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:27,097
从他们抓到你的地方出发  需要多久 一天吗?  两天?
From where they got you,how long a walk was it--Day? Two days?

220
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:30,093
你们飞机上的那些人怎么样?
Hey,what are the people like--from your plane?

221
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:33,042
他们太可怕了
Oh,they're just awesome.

222
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:37,028
我们的伊拉克人拷打了你们最后一个 来参观我们营地的人
Last one of you boys came for a visit got tortured by our Iraqi.

223
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:39,082
他也拷打过我
He tortured me,too.

224
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:44,064
他自己再清楚不过了
Well,hell,he don't know any better.

225
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,072

230
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,053

00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:58,051
你往那边跑
You run that way.

232
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:01,044
-等一下      -你往那边跑

00:24:51,037 --> 00:24:52,089
说吧
Say it!

237
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:55,073
说啊  Karl
Say it,Karl.

238
00:24:55,095 --> 00:25:00,078
对不起
I'm...sorry.

239
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:06,008
我尝试逃跑却把你卷进来了
Sorry I involved you in my breakout attempt.

240
00:25:34,088 --> 00:25:40,027
你刚来的时候我们给你的药有很强的副作用
The drugs we gave you when we brought you here have a fairly serious side effect--dehydration.

241
00:25:40,027 --> 00:25:41,078
你的头会很痛
Your head is probably sore.

242
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:49,087
舌头变得干燥  并且如果你不尽快进食   就会产生幻觉
Your throat is raw,and if you don't eat
 or drink something soon,you're going to start hallucinating.

243
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:54,033
那你是个医生了?
So you're a doctor,huh?

244
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:56,009
不
No.

245
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:59,057
我也是个讨债的
I'm a repo woman.

246
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,068
你不必被绑着
No strings attached.

247
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:05,070
你不需要回答问题
You don't have to answer any questions.

248
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,047
你什么都不用做  只要背靠墙坐好
You don't have to do anything but sit with your back up against the far wall.

249
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:16,024
我会打开门 放下盘子就走
Let me open that door,put the plate down and leave.

250
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:23,010
我知道如果你照做 就会好像你放弃了  输了
I know it feels like you're giving up,like you're 
losing if you do anything that I ask you to.

251
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,004
但是你没有
But you're not.

252
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:28,097
你需要吃东西
You need to eat.

253
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:34,094
你说呢?
What do you say?

254
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:12,000
谢谢你  Jack
Thank you,Jack.

255
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:23,048
拔掉脑膜上的管子  进入观察阶段
Let's take out the epidural catheter and get him started on a P. C. A.

256
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:29,049
你确定他能自我恢复么?
You sure he's ready to self-administer his pain meds?

257
00:27:39,063 --> 00:27:42,066
Shephard医生?
Dr. Shephard?

258
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:27,051
Jack?

259
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:28,040
把你的手机给我
Give me your cell phone.

260
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,073
-什么? 什...   -我现在就要看
-What?    -I wanna see it. Now.

261
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:32,041
看看你在哪儿  Jack
Look where you are,Jack.

262
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:36,025
拜托你四周看看
Just look around you,please.

263
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,020
把手机给我
Give me the phone!

264
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,033
这里不方便说这个
This is not the place for this.

265
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,084
你一定是Jack了
You must be Jack.

266
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:46,046
想坐下加入我们吗?
Why don't you,grab a chair and join us?

267
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,011
你...
You...

268
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:54,036
你认识我?
You know me?

269
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,065
是的
Yes.

270
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:57,040
你父亲经常和我们说起你
Your father's told us all about you.

271
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,025
是吗?  他说了我什么?
Yeah? What's he told you about me?

272
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:03,068
你和他们说了我什么  爸爸 那个你的...你的儿子总是失败者?
What'd you tell'em about me,dad-- that your--your son never really had it?

273
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:06,010
和他爸不一样
Not like the old man.

274
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:11,054
他不想成功  包括他的... 他的生活  他的工作  他的婚姻?
I didn't have the will to make it work-- my--my life,my job,my marriage?

275
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:15,098
关于我的婚姻你和他们说了什么  爸爸?
What'd you tell'em about my marriage,dad?!

276
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:19,036
你们知道他怎么安排的吗?
You know how he manages his marriage?

277
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:21,079
每晚吃饭钱喝一瓶苏格兰酒
A bottle of scotch every night before dinner.

278
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:25,011
你父亲已经50天没喝酒了
Your father has been sober 50 days now.

279
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:28,068
我们很为他骄傲
We're very proud of that.

280
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:33,009
喔  爸爸
Dad!

281
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,030
我想...是什么帮助了你?
I wonder what--what helped you turn that corner?

282
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,042
也许是...一个新的女朋友?
You think maybe it was--a new lady friend?

283
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,042
-你认为是这样... -我不会听你讲话了
-You think maybe that's what it was..  -I will not let you talk to me..

284
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:47,082
我不会让你和我妻子上床
I will not... sleep with my wife

285
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:49,028
Jack

286

Jack  我是你父亲

Jack  求你了  放手吧
Jack,please,just let it go!

288
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:20,045
往哪儿出去?
Which way out?

289
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:21,078
别这么做  Jack
Don't do this,Jack.

-打开门       -不  我不能  我不能  Jack
-Open the door.  -No,I can't Jack.

293
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:41,046
-开了门我们就死了   -你骗我
-I do that, we die.   -You're lying to me.

294
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,052
我没有  没有
I'm not.

她说的是真的  Jack
She's telling the truth,Jack.

我对天发誓... 我会杀了她

好吧
Okay.

299
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:03,003
反正你开了门她也会死的
Have her open the door,and she dies anyway.

300
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:06,010
我们都会死
We all do.

301
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:41,025

一直走

Stick your hands out through the bars.I'll take off your cuffs.

313
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,094
这手铐把你弄得够惨的  不是吗?
They scratched you up pretty bad,didn't they?

314
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,040
我过会给你带点消毒水

你忙的时候我能吹吹头发
While you're at it,I could use a blow-dry.

317

你弄到了个鱼形饼干
You got yourself a fish biscuit.

318

你怎么做到的?
How'd you do that?

319
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,061
我识破了你们的小发明  就是这样
I figured out your complicated gizmos,that's how.

320
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:33,045
上次那只熊只用了两个小时
Only took the bears two hours.

321
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:37,049
还有多少这样的?

衣服真漂亮
Nice dress.

328
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:10,000
他们逼我穿的
They made me wear it.

329
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,062
你饿么?
Are you hungry?

330
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:11,099
是个水族馆
It's an aquarium.

331
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,071

Excuse me?

332
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:19,070
这东西是干什么的...养鲨鱼?

334
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,085
我们在水下  是吗?
We're underwater,aren't we?

335
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:34,041
是的
Yes.

336
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:36,046
这是他们站点的其中之一吗
Is this one of their...

337
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:39,066
那个达摩组织
stations-- the--the Dharma Initiative?

338
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:43,021
他们叫这个为九头蛇站
They called it the Hydra.

339
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:47,061
所以你们就是...
So you people are just...

340
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:52,018
他们留下的人?
whatever's leftover of them?

341
00:36:52,032 --> 00:36:56,034
那是很久以前的事了
Well,that was a long time ago.

342

我们知道你的一切  Jack Shephard

你们一点都不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

我们知道你是洛杉矶圣塞巴斯蒂安医院的 脊椎外科医生
We know that you're a spinal surgeon based out of St.Sebastian's hospital in Los Angeles.
