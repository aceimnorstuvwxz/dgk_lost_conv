我没告诉他那是你的

Can I ask why he's being included in the conversation?

113
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,068
是为了伤害我的感情吗?
Is that supposed to hurt my feelings?

114
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:01,054
把你告诉我的告诉他

和其他站交流
that it can be used to communicate with other stations.

147
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:14,020
他计划这个周末就出发
He was leaving at the end of the week.

148
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,077
他去完成学业
He was going to continue his studies.

149
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,029
我会替他去
I will take his place there, too.

150
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,048
不  别
Don't! No!

151
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,071
求你了
Please!

152
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:14,034
不!

153
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:22,081
忏悔
Confess.

154
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:40,051
我们要去的珍珠站 有台电脑可能会帮助我们找到我们的人
We're headed now to the Pearl station.There's a
computer there that might help us find our people.

155
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:43,024
有人愿意和我们一起去吗?
Anybody want to come along?

156
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,088
你说"有人愿意和我们一起去吗"是什么意思?
What do you mean:"Anybody wanna come along"?

157
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,083
我的意思是 想来就来 岛上的景点都是免费的
I mean, if you'd like to join us,it's a free island.

158
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:53,051
没错  但是Jack都是一个人做事情
Yeah, see, Jack would go and do stuff alone

159
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:56,074
或者他带上Sayid或者Kate
or he'd take Sayid or Kate.

160
00:14:56,075 --> 00:15:01,048
是的  没错  但我不是Jack
Yeah, well, I'm not Jack.

161
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:03,030
人多力量大
The more the merrier.

162
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:05,026
-我去  -很好
-I'll go.  -Great.

163
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:06,031
什么?
What?

164
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:09,005
其他想来的人十分钟以后在树那里集合
Anybody else wanna come, meet us at the tree line in ten minutes.

165
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,004
带上水
Bring water.

166
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:13,022
你不是认真的吧
You're not serious.

167
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:16,044
你不是总抱怨他们不带上我们吗?
What? You always whine about not being included.

168
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:19,027
现在机会来了
Now's our chance.

169
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,047
你介意我问你一些问题吗  兄弟?
Do you mind if I ask you a question, brother?

170
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:27,048
说
Shoot.

171
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:30,044
我们是去找电脑
Are we going off to poke at a computer,

172
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:33,051
还是去找你们的Eko?
or are we going after your man Eko?

173
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:36,080
一箭双雕
Two birds, one stone.

174
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,005
Eko去了飞机坠毁的地方
Eko's heading for the plane that crashed

175
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,066
就在舱门的上面
on top of the entrance to the Pearl station.

176
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:46,001
是吗  太巧了
Well, that's quite a coincidence.

177
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:50,014
不要把命运和巧合搞混了
Don't mistake coincidence for fate.

178
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,042
你不该那样做
You're not supposed to do that.

179
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,057
那是圣水
That's holy water.

180
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:38,006
我用它洗去罪恶
I'm washing away my sins.

181
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:39,039
Yemi神父从来不...
Father Yemi would never...

182
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,021
我不是Yemi神父
I'm not father Yemi.

183
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,093
别动
Wait there!

184
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,070
Yemi神父在哪里?
Where... Where is father Yemi?

185
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:06,054
谁想知道?
Who wants to know?

186
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,001
也许你没听清楚
Perhaps you did not hear me.

187
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,036
我说  Yemi神父在哪里?
I said,where is father Yemi?

188
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,057
货还没到  我刚接到电话
The shipment is late.I just got off the telephone.

189
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:22,046
他们保证星期五会到的
They assure me it will arrive on Friday.

190
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:24,008
什么货?
What shipment?

191
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,085
你应该告诉你们的新神父我们之间的协议
You should explain our arrangement to your new priest.

192
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:30,091
收到的红十字会疫苗中...
We receive shipments of vaccines from the Red Cross.

193
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,050
我们保留20%
We are allowed to keep 20%.

194
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,093
剩下的给Emeka和他的人
The rest, we give to Emeka and his men.

195
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:38,007
这是保护费
In exchange for protection.

196
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,095
那么...你看  神父
So you see, father...

197
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:44,074
大家都很高兴吧
everybody is happy, huh?

198
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:47,056
大家都很高兴
Everybody's happy.

199
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:50,005
大家都得到了好处
Everybody benefits.

200
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:55,044
所以我希望你继续我们的协议
So I hope you will continue to honor our arrangement.

201
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:59,080
我不怕你
I am not afraid of you.

202
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:19,097
我星期五来取疫苗  神父
I'll be back for the vaccine on Friday, father.

203
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,078
你不想再死人了吧
You don't want more lives on your conscience.

204
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:25,020
你好  Eko

205
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:45,010
猜猜午餐吃什么?
You wanna guess what's for lunch?

206
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:48,033
我不擅长猜谜
I'm not...I'm not big on mysteries.

207
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:51,010
当然
Of course you're not.

208
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:58,078
你们有干酪汉堡?
You people have cheeseburgers?

209
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,039
你不知道
You have no idea

210
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,098
为了做这个给你我费了多少心
what I went through to make this for you.

211
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,037
我杀了牛  割下肉
I killed the cow,processed the meat,

212
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,023
烘烤芝麻

213
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,087
还有面包...
And the fries...

214
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:13,009
用动物油炸的
try rendering animal fat.

215
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:16,024
没有调味番茄酱吗?
No ketchup?

216
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:28,010
-我想和他谈谈  -好 谈吧
-I'd like to talk to him.  -Okay, so talk to him.

217
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:29,086
可以单独谈吗
Alone, please.

218
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:31,003
我不介意她听
I'm fine with her being here.

219
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:32,033
我知道你不介意  Jack
And I'm thrilled that you're fine, Jack,

220
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,053
但这是隐私
but it's private.

221
00:20:34,054 --> 00:20:38,043
医生和病人之间的秘密?
Doctor-patient confidentiality?

222
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:45,089
当然  没问题
Sure.Of course.

223
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,054
介意我吃东西吗?
Mind if I eat?

224
00:20:59,064 --> 00:21:04,006
我们有一个很好的击败你的计划  Jack
We had such a wonderful plan to break you, Jack.

225
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,077
击败我?
Break me?

226
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:08,051
骗过你
Wear you down

227
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:11,091
等到你相信我们不是你的敌人
until you were convinced we weren't your enemies.

228
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:14,077
得到你的信任
Get you to trust us.

229
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:16,000
到时候  我们让你相信
And then, of course,we'd lead you to believe

230
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:20,096
你做的事都是上天安排的
that you were choosing to do whatever we asked you to do.

231
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:25,045
当然这都是计划  你自己会思考
All of this assumed, of course,that you would get invested.

232
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:27,080
思考什么?
Invested in what?

233
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:29,003
你发现了吗?
Has it not occurred to you

234
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:33,091
Juliet和你的前妻很像
that Juliet bears a striking resemblance to your ex-wife?

235
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,066
为什么给我说这些?
Why are you telling me this?

236
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,070
这是因为  Jack
I'm telling you this, Jack,

237
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:47,075
我完美的计划曝光了
because my wonderful plan got shot to sunshine

238
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:52,047
当你看到我的X光片发现我快死了的时候
when you saw my damned X-rays and figured out I was dying.

239
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:56,074
这一切...
All of this...

240
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,081
你为了让我给你动手术把我带到这里
you brought me here to operate on you.

241
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,071
你...
You...

242
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:03,052
你想我救你的命
you want me to save your life.

243
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:07,095
不 我让你想要救我的命
No, I want you to want to save my life.

244
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:11,073
但现在已经不行了
But we're beyond that now, so...

245
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:18,044
我想说的就是你能否考虑一下
all I can ask is that you think about it.

246
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:32,098
你相信上帝吗  Jack?
Do you believe in God, Jack?

247
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:35,066
你呢?
Do you?

248
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,062
两天前我发现
Two days after I found out

249
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:39,067
我脊柱附近有个致命的肿瘤之后
I had a fatal tumor on my spine,

250
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:43,049
突然出现了一个外科医生
a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky.

251
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:48,080
如果这不是有上帝的证据
And if that's not proof of God,

252
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:51,061
那是什么
I don't know what is.

253
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:13,013
你真的没事吗?
You sure you're all right?

254
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:16,058
我们可以停下来喘口气
We can stop for a bit and catch our breaths.

255
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,049
我没事
I'm fine.

256
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:24,024
你要去飞机坠毁的地方  是吗?
You're heading for the plane wreckage, aren't you?

257
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:25,071
Charlie听到你在叫你的兄弟
Charlie heard you call out for your brother

258
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:28,064
在你离开帐篷之前
before you left the camp.

259
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:30,092
那就是你来这里的原因吗?
Is that what you're doing out here,

260
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:33,056
找Yemi?
looking for Yemi?

261
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:38,057
不要再说我兄弟的名字
Do not speak my brother's name again.

262
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:43,000
你怎么这么害怕  Eko?
What are you so afraid of, Eko?

263
00:23:48,007 --> 00:23:50,012
两天之内再回来检查一下
You need to come back in two days.

264
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,075
神父
Father.

265
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,065
我能为你做什么?
What can I do for you?

266
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,085
那就是你说的疫苗吗
It's that the vaccines that you spoke of...

267
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:57,086
货什么时候到一次?
how often do the shipments come?

268
00:23:57,087 --> 00:24:01,023
六个月一次  如果我们运气好的话
Every six months,if we are lucky.

269
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:04,027
你怎么对我们的
What makes you so interested

270
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:08,003
疫苗这么感兴趣?
in our shipments of vaccine, father?

271
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:13,037
你同意把大部分都给土匪?
You agreed to give most of it to the militia?

272
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,047
疫苗在黑市上售价很高
The vaccines fetch a high price on the black market.

273
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,054
不管你在想什么 别惹那些人
Whatever you are thinking, do not cross these men.

274
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:24,008
Yemi神父来之前  我们什么都没有
Before father Yemi,we got nothing.

275
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:27,091
这些疫苗都是他的功劳
We owe whatever vaccines we have to his work.

276
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:32,026
你让我想起了他
You remind me of him,you know.

277
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:35,041
你也是个好人
You are a good man, too.

278
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:57,054
听说你想卖些疫苗
I hear you have some vaccine to sell.

279
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:59,093
对  但星期天之前必须成交
I do, but it has to be done by Sunday.

280
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:02,011
我要离开这个国家了
I'm leaving the country.

281
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:04,069
没问题
No problem.

282
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,072
舱门就在飞机下面
The hatch is over here by the plane.

283
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:18,077
你把大家带下去好吗?
Why don't you take everybody down?

284
00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:20,065
你呢?
And you?

285
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:23,037
我暂时不下去
I'll be there in a minute.

286
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,034
Eko在找什么?
What's Eko looking for?

287
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:30,089
飞机里那具他兄弟的尸体
His brother's body's in that plane.

288
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:55,054
告诉我...
So...

289
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:59,042
你到底看到了什么?
what exactly did you see back there?

290
00:26:00,008 --> 00:26:02,024
我也看到过
I saw it once, you know.

291
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:03,084
你看到了什么?
What did you see?

292
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:07,014
我看到一道很亮的光
I saw a very bright light.

293
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:11,043
它很美
It was beautiful.

294
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,078
我看到的不是那个
That is not what I saw.

295
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,037
我兄弟不见了
My brother's gone.

296
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:09,078
你把飞机烧了  Yime的尸体可能烧化了
You set the plane on fire.Yemi's body could have burned.

297
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,043
或者..或者是有动物...
Not to mention animals or...

298
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:26,058
那么...你想和我们一起下去吗?
so... you don't wanna come down there with us?

299
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:34,068
不  我在这里等你们
No, I will wait here.

300
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,058
好吧
Well...

301
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:40,051
差点忘记了
Oh, I forgot.

302
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:44,004
找你的时候我发现了这个
I found this when I was looking for you.

303
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:33,026
你好  神父
Hello, father.

304
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:37,098
我听说你有一批疫苗要卖
I hear you have a shipment of vaccine for sale.

305
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:39,037
如果你认为
If you thought

306
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:41,094
你可以背着我干这些事情
you could do this without me knowing,

307
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:44,071
那么你不了解我
you don't know who I am.

308
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:49,068
知道吗...
You know...

309
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:51,034
你很幸运  神父
you're lucky, father.

310
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:54,006
我是个迷信的人
I'm a superstitious man.

311
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:57,049
我不喜欢夺走神职人员的性命
I don't relish taking the life of a holy man.

312
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,038
所以今天
That is why, today,

313
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:04,067
我要砍了你的手
I'm only going to cut off your hands.

314
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:24,004
求你了  别这样
Please! No!

315
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:27,046
你不知道我是谁
You do not know who I am.

316
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:06,084
我是Mark Wickmund博士 这是...
I'm Dr.Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film

317
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:09,086
达摩启动计划第五站的介绍电影
for station five of Dharma Initiative.

318
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:12,051
第五站  或者说珍珠
Station five, or the Pearl,

319
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:14,018
是一个监视站
is a monitoring station

320
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,095
用来监视和记录
where the activities of participants

321
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:20,067
达摩计划参与者的活动...
in Dharma Initiative projects can be observed and recorded...

322
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,094
怎么样?
Well?

323
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:24,007
只有一根导线
The wiring is only one way.

324
00:30:24,008 --> 00:30:26,073
这是个闭合系统  死胡同
It's a closed system,a dead end.

325
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,097
伙计们?
Hey, guys?

326
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:31,039
其他的影片讲的是什么?
What are these other TVs for?

327
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,025
什么?
Sorry?

328
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:35,013
所有的影片
All these TVs.

329
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:38,040
这个人说这里有六个站
This guy says that there's six stations.

330
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:41,066
就在这里  看吧
All right, here.Check it out.

331
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:46,067
...是一个监视站
...is a monitoring station

332
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:48,059
用来监视和记录
where the activities of the participants

333
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,034
达摩启动计划
in Dharma Initiative projects

334
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:52,079
参与者的活动...
can be observed and recorded...

335
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,006
"计划"不只一个
Projects. More than one.

336
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:58,056
所以这里的其他一些影片 可能和其他舱门有联系
So maybe some of these TVs are connected to the other hatches.

337
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:01,025
我突然觉得自己很笨
Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.

338
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,058
也许我可以接上另一根线
Perhaps I could patch in one of the other feeds,

339
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,078
看看能不能得到其他影像
see if we can get another picture.

340
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:10,038
你们在珍珠的任务持续三个星期...
Your tour of duty in the Pearl will last three weeks...

341
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:19,038
厕所还是好的
The toilet still works.

342
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,085
有图像吗?
Anything yet?

343
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:28,079
没有
Nothing.

344
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,053
现在呢?
What about now?

345
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:38,054
-John?  -有图像了
-John?  -Yeah, we got something.

346
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,010
这是什么?
What is it?

347
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:45,056
这个问题提得不错
That's a good question.

348
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:47,070
这些是电脑
Those are computers.

349
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,075
太好了 这就是你们要找的东西
Great. That's what you're looking for.

350
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:53,075
现在我们可以离开这里了
Now we can get out of here.

351
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:12,063
我想他会期待我们的到访
I guess he'll be expecting us.

352
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,074
你不再相信我了吗?
You don't trust me anymore?

353
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:29,042
我相信你  我只是来放电影的
I trust you just fine.Just thought I'd put a movie in.

354
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:30,097
你知道吗  我很不想看电影
You know what? I'm gonna pass on the movie.

355
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:33,069
你会喜欢的 这是"杀掉一只知更鸟"
You'll like this one, Jack.It's "To kill a mockingbird."

356
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,029
-是部经典片  -我现在真的不想看
-It's a classic.  -I don't wanna watch a movie right now.

357
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,053
那我把声音关了吧
I'll turn the sound down, then.

358
00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:46,023
我觉得我应该向你道歉
I felt like I should apologize,say I'm sorry.

359
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:49,062
我很抱歉带你来这里
I'm sorry for bringing you here

360
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:51,005
也对我们做的所有事情
and for everything that's been done to you

361
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:54,045
以及你的朋友道歉
and your friends.

362
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:57,017
但你必须知道...
But you have to know...

363
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,095
我们情非得以
we were desperate.

364
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:03,049
为了拯救他的生命我们只能这么做 (别管我在说什么)
It was also we could save his life.

365
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:09,025
Ben...

366
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:12,075
他是个很好的人
he's a great man.

367
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:19,096
我知道你很难相信 但是真的 (Ben是个骗子)
I know you find that hard to believe,but he is.

368
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:28,022
也许你会觉得...你没有选择 (而且他很危险)
You probably feel like...you don't have a choice,

369
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:31,042
其实不是的  Jack
but you do, Jack.

370
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:40,005
大家都有自由选择的权力对吗? (我们想要反抗他  但必须让别人以为是事故)
Free will is all we've really got, right?

371
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:44,096
无论如何...
Anyway...

372
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:54,061
只是想告诉你我的想法 (看起来我们好像要救他  剩下的就靠你了)
just wanted to put in my two cents.

373
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:58,028
我以前告诉过你你可以相信我
I told you before you can trust me.

374
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:03,086
现在我希望你能相信我
I want you to trust me now,

375
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:05,038
我希望你做外科手术
when I tell you that doing the surgery is

376
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:15,000
对你来说这是件好事 (这是个很复杂的外科手术  其他人不会知道)
absolutely the right thing for you to do.

377
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:20,075
因为他应该活下去 (我会保护你的)
It's the right thing,because he deserves  to live.

378
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,006
(现在叫我把电影关了)

379
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:32,065
关掉电影
Turn the movie off.

380
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:33,028
Jack...

381
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,063
关了  马上
Turn it off. Now.

382
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:42,061
好的  关了
All right. It's off.

383
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:59,003
请你考虑一下我的建议
Think about what I said...please.

384
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:12,073
你去哪里?
Where are you going?

385
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:14,035
伦敦
London.

386
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:17,034
你是坏人吗?
Are you a bad man?

387
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:23,058
妈妈说你是个坏人
My mom says you are a bad man.

388
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:28,050
上帝才知道
Only God knows.

389
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:37,038
你拿到疫苗了
I see you have your vaccine.

390
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,099
你想我感谢你吗?
Do you expect me to be grateful?

391
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,016
我知道你想干什么
I know what you were planning to do.

392
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,016
那些人  我帮助他们...
Those men, I helped...

393
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:46,074
会有其他人代替他们的
Those men will be replaced by other men.

394
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:54,007
他们在干什么? 他们这是什么意思?
What are they doing?What is the meaning of this?

395
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:57,017
他们正在封教堂
They are boarding up the church.

396
00:35:57,063 --> 00:36:00,039
我们不能再用它了
We can no longer use it.

397
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,066
这是Yemi的教堂 你们没有权力这么做
This is Yemi's church.You have no right to do this.

398
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:06,010
它已经不神圣了
It is no longer sacred,

399
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:09,079
有一天你因为你做的事遭到报应的
and one day, you'll be judged for what you did.

400
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,076
如果我是你
If I were you,

401
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:14,090
我会开始过安宁的生活
I would start making my peace now.

402
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:17,034
我会去伦敦然后开始反悔
I would go to London and begin to repent,

403
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:21,025
因为你欠了上帝你带走的那几条人命
because you owe God for every life you've taken.

404
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:25,043
你真的觉得这是Yemi的吗?
And you truly believe this is Yemi's?

405
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:30,038
你还欠了他一座教堂
You owe him one church.

406
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:53,065
Yemi

407
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:56,041
等一下
Wait.

408
00:36:57,076 --> 00:37:00,040
Yemi

409
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:04,017
Yemi

410
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,066
你说过你想听我忏悔
You say you want to hear my confession.

411
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:12,008
为什么? 为什么是现在?
Why? Why now, eh?

412
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:13,013
快出来
Show yourself!

413
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:15,055
你在哪里?
Where are you?

414
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:18,034
哪里?
Where?

415
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,008
准备好了吗  Eko?
Are you ready, Eko?

416
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,070
是的
Yes.

417
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:48,076
我准备好了  Yemi
I am ready, Yemi.

418
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:07,070
我不希望得到原谅  神父...
I ask for no forgiveness,father...

419
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:11,015
因为我没有罪
for I have not sinned.

420
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:16,009
我只是做了为了活下来所必须做的事
I have only done what I needed to do to survive.

421
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,093
一个小男孩曾经问我
A small boy once asked me

422
00:38:23,094 --> 00:38:26,076
我是不是坏人
if I was a bad man.

423
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:30,025
如果我现在可以回答他
If I could answer him now,

424
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:32,059
我会告诉他
I would tell him

425
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,066
我还是个小男孩的时候
that when I was a young boy,

426
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:41,006
为了救我的兄弟我杀了一个人
I killed a man to save my brother's life.

427
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:47,005
我不为这感到抱歉
I am not sorry for this.

428
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:50,060
我为此感到自豪
I am proud of this.

429
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:02,048
我没有要求得到上帝给我的生命
I did not ask for the life that I was given,

430

你是谁?
Who are you?
