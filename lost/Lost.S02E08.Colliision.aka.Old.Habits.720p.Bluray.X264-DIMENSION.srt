他刚才拿枪指着你的脖子

我们得把他绑起来

用担架上的树藤

00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:25,036
如果我们把担架拆了  我们就无法...

67
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:27,019

你好么?

80
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:22,000

你的职务

82
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:30,012
取证部门?  你想让我坐办公桌?

85
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:40,023
你还在被察看期间  不行
You were in an officer-involved shooting. No.

86
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:44,012
是因为你是我的上司你才这么做?
You doing this because you're my captain?

87
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:48,078
还是因为你是我的妈妈?
Or because you're my mother?

88
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:54,059
两个都是
Both.

00:06:57,005 --> 00:07:03,006
拜托让我去巡逻吧
I  need to be back on the street. Please.

90
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,064
如果我让你去巡逻
I put you in a car,

91
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:08,015
谁都知道是我安排的
everyone's gonna know that I pulled strings.

92
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,010
你不是不想让我对你像对女儿一样么?
You don't want me to treat you like my daughter?

93
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,040
那么就别求我帮你
Don't ask for favors.

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,090
那就把我调走
Then transfer me.

95
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:23,005
我不会调走你的  你去巡逻吧
You don't get the transfer,but I'll give you the car.

不好意思打扰一下  长官
Sorry to bother you,captain.

98
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:32,036
Ana  大房间有你的电话  他们说很重要

99
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:36,064

Thanks, Raggs. I'll be right there.

100
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,085
他们给你准备了一个蛋糕
They got you a cake.

101
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:43,075
要装作很惊讶的样子
Try and act surprised.

102
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:58,065
Jack  很高兴在舱子外面见到你
Jack, nice to see you out of the hatch.

103
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:00,055
你可以多晒会儿太阳了
You could use more sunshine.

104
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:02,034
我会考虑一下的
I'll take that under advisement.

105
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,081
来点儿水果也许会更好
Little fruit might do you good,too.

106
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:08,047
对身体有益  至少他们是这么说的
Good for the constitution.Least that's what they say.

107
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:13,023
如果是他们说的...
Well,if that's what they say.

108
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,086
这些水果你是从哪儿来的?
Where did you get these?

109
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:23,086
即使你很兴奋也不用还没吞下去就说话啊
Just cos you're excited, no reason to talk with your mouth full.

110
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:37,014
打过那棵树  我们赌双倍
Past the hanging tree,double or nothing.

111
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:38,017
你确定?
You sure?

112
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,064
伙计  就赌双倍  你不可能打那么远
There's no way you're hitting it that far.

113
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:43,069
Hurley  这女人就像打了内固醇
Hurley, the woman's on bloody steroids.

114
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,011
两倍就是一万美元
Double's 10,000 bucks.

115
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:48,009
那对于一个身家  1亿5千万的人来说并不算什么
That's nothing to someone worth $150 million.

116
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,003
如果你喜欢  他可以给你建一个私人球场
He'll build you your own course if you'd like.

117
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:55,008
-他说什么?  -别理他  他是个白痴
-What's he talking about?  -Ignore him. He's an idiot.

118
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:59,024
真该死
Crap!

119
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,054
你打弯了
You hooked it.

120
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:05,061
试着伸直你的左臂
Try  keeping your left arm straight.

121
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:07,077
你在给我传授经验?
You're giving me tips?

122
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:10,091
Kate  我...
Kate, I'm...

123
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,098
我是个医生
I'm a doctor.

124
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:17,008
所以你认为你可以打得更好?
So you think you could do better?

125
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:20,036
谁都可以击球  但那不是高尔夫
Anyone can hit a ball.That's not golf.

126
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,031
那么什么才是高尔夫?
And what's golf?

127
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:28,058
高尔夫讲求精确性
Golf is accuracy.

128
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:32,080
那么我们来比几个洞试试?
Well, why don't we play a few holes

129
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,099
比比我们俩谁更精确?
and see which one of us is more accurate?

130
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:42,062
你在开玩笑  是么?
You're kidding, right?

131
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:47,030
三个洞  不设标准杆  谁赢谁才有权说大话
Three holes,no handicap.We play for bragging rights.

132
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,096
我们还等什么?
What are we waiting for?

133
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:01,014
Ana  我们快去他们的营地吧  那只是一场意外
Ana, let's just get to their camp.It was an accident.

134
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,014
他们会理解的
They'll understand.

135
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:08,095
他们会理解的?我杀了他们中的一个
They'll understand?I killed one of them.

136
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:19,082
-这两人想动你就喊  -等等  你想干...
-Those two move? Shout.  -Wait. What are you do...

137
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:25,040
放开我
Untie me.

138
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,088
-我不会...  -放开我
-I'm not gonna...  -Untie me!

139
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:31,071
Ana!

140
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:37,076
你做什么?
What are you doing?

141

她很高  金发

-还有一个阿拉伯男人...  -是Shannon

288
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:28,066
你说你们那伙儿有5人?

290
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:31,098

你能带我去他们那儿么?
Can  you take me to them?

294
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,092
不行

他得了败血症

298
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:01,099
感染已经侵入血液循环了

299
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:07,031
如果抗生素不能退烧  他会休克的
If the antibiotics don't bring the fever down,he'll go into shock.

300
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:10,033
扶住他

你得听我说  好么?
You need to listen to me, okay?

308
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,008
只有你吞下了这颗药丸你才能好
The only way that you are gonna get better is if you take this pill.

309
00:24:58,017 --> 00:25:02,059
所以你得吞下它  好么?
So I need you to swallow it, okay?

310

00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:23,010
好的  好的  非常好
Good. Good. That's good.

314
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:28,064
干得好
Nice job.

315
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,083
我从没在医学院学过耳语治疗
Never learned the whole whisper-in-the-earthing in med school.

316
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:51,093
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

317
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:54,032
我要走了  Ana
I'm going, Ana.

318
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:58,053
我不想再这么呆下去了
I don't want to be a part of this.

319
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:02,023
我了解你为我们做的一切
I know everything you've done for us.

320
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:09,028
并且如果不是你我根本不可能活下来 但是我要走了
And I wouldn't even be alive if it weren't for you. But I'm going.

321
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:14,008
你呢?
What about you?

322
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:18,027
我只是认为你的性格不太好
I just don't think you're the best judge of character.

323
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:23,052
你把Nathan扔进坑里这件事我倒是很赞同的
I was with you when you put Nathan in the pit.

324
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:28,005
好吧
All right.

325
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:33,029
你想走是么?  那么走吧

331
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,065

Sun
Sun

333
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:55,056
没事的  Jin很好
It's all right. Jin is okay.

334
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:57,060
发生了什么事?  他在哪儿?
What happened? Where is he?

335
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,040
他没事  我会解释的
He's fine, and I'll explain.

336
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,051
但是现在我得找到Jack
But right now I need to find Jack.

337
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:11,019
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?

338
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:18,090
我说了...他们在哪儿?
I said... where are they?

339
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:24,029
-Jack  这不是他的错... -Shannon死了  我不...
-Jack, it's not his fault...  -Shannon's dead! I'm not...

340
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:30,054
你得马上把我带回那儿去
You're gonna take me back out there right now.

341
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:33,027
问题不在他身上  他把Sawyer带回来了
This man isn't the problem. He brought Sawyer back.

342
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:38,056
已经半死了  肩上还有个枪眼  John
Half-dead, with a bullet hole through his shoulder, John!

343
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:44,026
你是想和我说话  还是就坐在那儿?
Are you gonna talk to me, or are you just gonna sit there?

344
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:50,023
我说的一切都会使你更生气
Anything I say will only make you angry.

345
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:56,069
那么  是的  我就坐在这儿
So, yes, I will sit here.

346
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,017
Jack!

347
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:03,033
Jack! Jack!

348
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:08,038
Michael.

349
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,099
我们遇到麻烦了  伙计
We got a problem,man.

350
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:19,082
你记得怎么回到那儿去  是么?
You remember how to get out there, right?

351
00:29:19,082 --> 00:29:20,073
我想是的
I think so.

352
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:22,067
我们得停下来好好想想  Jack
We should stop and think about this, Jack

353
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:25,001
想什么  John?  Shannon死了
Think about what, John? Shannon's dead.

354
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:26,063
Sayid正在枪口上
Sayid's being held at gunpoint.

355
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:30,011
你是想呆在这儿期盼事情自己解决么?
You want to sit here and hope that situation resolves itself?

356

00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:47,064
什么?
Excuse me?

362
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:54,042
和平?  复仇? 公正?  你就是要拿着枪来解决问题么?
Peace? Revenge? Justice? And you are going out with all these guns.

363
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,068
你想要什么?
What do you want?

364
00:29:55,068 --> 00:29:57,096
我要我们的人安全回来
I want all of our people back here safely.

365
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:02,083
-你的朋友谋杀了...  -Ana Lucia犯了个错误

367
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:09,079
Ana Lucia犯了个错误
Ana Lucia made a mistake.

368
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:15,046
Ana Lucia.

369
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,053
我带你去那儿
I will take you there.

370
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:29,014
但是只能带你一个人去
But only you.

371
00:30:29,014 --> 00:30:32,093
并且不能带枪
And no guns.

372
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:44,083
我们走吧
Let's go.

373
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:52,086
你是哪儿人?
Where you from?

374
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:04,022
你是哪儿人?
Where are you from?

375
00:31:05,082 --> 00:31:09,047
伊拉克
I am from Iraq.

376
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,035
你有孩子么?
You have any kids?

377
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:19,040
你为什么这么问?
Why are you asking me if I have children?

378
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,008
我很好奇
I'm curious.

379
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:24,060
我没有  你有么?
I do not. Do you have children?

380
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,023
没有
No.

381
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:30,014
你会杀了我么?
Are you going to kill me?

382
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:33,070
你现在就在想这个问题  是么?
That's what you're thinking about, isn't it?

383
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,031
我需要么?
Should I?

384
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:44,033
大约40天前  在这个岛上
Almost 40 days ago, on this very island,

385
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:49,051
我把一个男人绑在树上拷问他
I tied a man to a tree,and I tortured him.

386
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:54,050
我折磨他就像我折磨的许多人一样...
I tortured him, as I've tortured many men...

387
00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:00,010
晚上那些人的声音还回响在我耳畔
men whose voices I still hear at night.

388
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:05,023
你该杀我么?
Should you kill me?

389
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,097
也许你该这么做
Maybe you should.

390
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:14,021
也许你正打算这么做
Maybe you were meant to.

391
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,083
我是个警察
I'm a cop.

392
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:37,024
我曾是个警察
Well... I was a cop.

393
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:43,001
一个晚上  我和我的搭档  去处理一起入室行窃案件
One night, my partner and I responded to a burglary call.

394
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:45,014
我们是第一个到达那儿的
We were the first ones there.

395
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:51,056
我在前门守着  他去后面察看
I covered the front,and he went around the back.

396
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:55,078
过了一会儿
I was there a minute.

397
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:59,037
那个孩子从前门出来了
Then this kid comes right through the front door.

398
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:02,010
我叫他把手举起来
I tell him to put his hands up.

399
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,045
但他说我弄错了
And he says I'm making a mistake,

400
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:08,061
他还是个学生
that he's a student.

401
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:13,081
而且他想给我看他的身份证
And he wants to show me his I.D.

402
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:17,039
我相信了
I believed him.

403
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,084
我就...
I just...

404
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:26,074
我就让他过来了
I let him reach.

405
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:30,036
然后就是一声枪响
All I remember was a pop.

406
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:35,054
我倒地的时候我以为我已经死了
By the time I hit the ground, I thought I was dead.

407
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:43,018
我觉得我死了
I feel dead.

408
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:52,002
那个人后来怎样了...那个向你开枪的人?
What happened to him...the man who shot you?

409
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:38,035
Jason.

410
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:50,035
我认识你?
I know you?

411
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:55,020
我那时怀孕了
I was pregnant.

412
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:14,066
他后来怎样了?
What happened to him?

413
00:35:22,047 --> 00:35:27,083
不知道  他们没抓住他
Nothing. They never found him.

414
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:57,081
来吧
Go ahead.

415
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:02,097
捡起来
Pick it up.

416
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:06,096
这是我应得的报应
I deserve it.

417
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:18,056
杀了你又有什么好处...
What good would it be to kill you...

418
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:23,079
如果我们已经都死了呢?
if we're both already dead?

419
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:28,073
