00:00:01,077 --> 00:00:04,087
《迷失》前情提要
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:08,074
你好  Ben
Hello, Ben.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:11,045
-你还活着  -是的
- You're alive. - Yes, I am.

4
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:14,060
你说你知道怎么找到他们吗  找到Jin
Are you saying you know how to find them? How to find Jin?

5
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,074
我有些主意
I have some ideas.

6
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:17,048
这么说你是知道的
So you knew

7
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:20,064
如果我们带他回来  这会发生在Locke身上
This would happen to Locke if we brought him back here?

8
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:23,050
死者已矣
Dead is dead.

9
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:26,007
你不可能让他们复活的
You don't get come back from that.

10
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:29,049
在天鹅站的那些达摩组织的人
The Dharma folks at the swan work site--

11
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:30,064
他们会钻到地下
They're gonna drill into the ground

12
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:33,055
并且无意中触发一股巨大的能量
And accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy,

13
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:37,037
那会导致你们的飞机  大洋航班815号
And that will cause your plane-- oceanic 815--

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,028
坠毁在这岛上
To crash on this island.

15
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:42,029
我想我可以中和掉那股能量
I think I can negate that energy.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,010
如果成功的话  那个船舱就不会建造
If I can, then that hatch will never be built,

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,053
然后你们的飞机会按原计划着陆
And your plane will land just like it's supposed to.

18
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:52,098
那你具体是怎么计划破坏这股能量的呢
And just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?

19
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:55,062
我要引爆一颗氢弹
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

20
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:03,060
Richard  炸弹在哪  在哪里
Where's the bomb, Richard? Where is it?

21
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:05,028
我要你的人去埋起来的那颗氢弹
The hydrogen bomb that I told your people to bury.

22
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:07,022
藏在哪里
Where is it?

23
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:10,078
听我说  把枪放下  我们好好谈  行吧
Listen to me. lower your gun, and we'll talk. okay?

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,089
没必要要伤人  把枪放下吧
Nobody has to get hurt here. Just put the gun down.

25
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:22,071
我会给你3秒钟考虑
I'm gonna give you three seconds.

26
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:25,019
-一  -别这样
- One... - Don't do this.

27
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,036
他在那干什么呢
What's he doing down there?

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,028
Jack  他疯了  是吗
Jack, he's crazy. is he?

29
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:35,009
如果这正是我们在这里的原因会怎么样
What if this is why we're here?

30
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,073
如果这是我们唯一的机会
What if this is our one chance

31
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:40,010
把事情还原成他们的本来面目
To put things back the way they're supposed to be?

32
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,054
不  你以为你想做什么呢
No. What the hell do you think you're doing?!

33
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:47,040
他们开枪打了他  我要去帮忙
They shot him! I'm gonna go help.

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,080
是的  他们也会开枪打你的
Yeah, they're gonna shoot you too.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,041
我们必须走  Jack  现在就得走
We have to go, Jack. We have to go now.

36
00:01:57,053 --> 00:02:00,056
-Jack  -不准动
- Jack! - Don't you move!

37
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,016
不准动
Don't move.

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,048
你到底是谁
Just who the bloody hell might you be?

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,048
Eloise
Eloise!

40
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:45,019
发生了什么事
What happened?

41
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:50,076
这人走进营地  用枪指着我的脑袋
This man walked into camp and put a gun to my head,

42
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:53,009
然后Eloise反击了  你在哪发现他们
And Eloise... reacted. Where'd you find them?

43
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,024
蹲在草丛里面  象老鼠一样
Crouched in the bushes... like rats.

44
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:58,053
你们是和这个人一起的吗
Did you two come here with this man?

45
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:03,031
是的
Yes.

46
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,023
把他们关进我的帐篷
Put them in my tent.

47
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,043
你愿意告诉我吗  Eloise
Would you care to tell me, Eloise,

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,049
为什么达摩组织似乎要对我们宣战呢
Why the Dharma initiative seems to have declared war on us?

49
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:20,063
这些人不是来自达摩组织的  Charles
These people aren't from the dharma initiative, Charles.

50
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:28,066
那他们从哪里来
Then where the hell are they from?

51
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:34,004
三十年后
thirty years later

52
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:01,084
Richard  他来了
Richard, he's here.

53
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,029
我带来了晚餐
I brought dinner.

54
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,025
John
John?

55
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,094
你好  Richard
Hello, Richard.

56
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,035
好久不见
It's been a while.

57
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:31,047
有三年了吧
It's--it's been, uh, three years.

58
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,098
发生了什么事  你去了哪里
What happened? What--where--where were you?

59
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,067
我会在路上解释
I'll explain on the way.

60
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,002
去哪里的路上
On the way where?

61
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,011
快要到晚上了
It's gonna be night soon.

62
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:42,000
你和我有任务要执行
You and I have an errand to run,

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,067
我们没有太多时间
And we don't have a lot of time.

64
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:50,045
怎么了
What's wrong?

65
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:53,035
你有些不一样
Something different about you.

66
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:58,099
我现在有目标了
I have a purpose now.

67
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:08,065
他在这干嘛呢
What's he doing here?

68
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:11,041
他帮我回到这里的
He helped me get back.

69
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,091
为什么Locke说这些是他的手下
Why did Locke say these were his people?

70
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:20,032
我以为是你的手下
I thought they were yours.

71
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,091
当我离开这岛的时候  John来了

73
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:27,054
跟他说话的人是谁

74
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:30,043
他叫Richard Alpert

75

军师

80
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,012
你说什么

00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,017

你记得他们吗  随便是谁
Do you remember them? A-any of them?

87
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:17,014
是的  30年前我在这里

而且我确实记得这些人

00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:23,075
我记得非常清楚和他们的见面  因为

你说这是真的吗

他们都死了吗

97
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:12,046
我认为我们回来不会一无所获的  Sun

我准备好了  John

我给你的指南针你还留着吗

有点生锈了  但还能找准方向
A little rusty, but she can still find north.

101
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:31,053
Ben  你能跟我们一起走就好了
Ben, I'd appreciate it if you'd join us.

102
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:35,032
怎么了  难道你对我和过去的下属在一起不放心吗
What, John, don't you trust me here with my former people?

103
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,084
担心我搞突然袭击吗
Afraid I'll stage a coup?

104
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,038
你再耍什么花招  我也无所畏惧
I'm not afraid of anything you can do anymore, Ben.

105
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:44,054
这样的话  我愿意加入
Well, in that case, i'd love to come.

106
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,015

希望能有所发现

109
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:54,052
Sun  无论发生什么事  我向你保证
But whatever happens, sun,you have my word.

110
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:57,000
如果有办法能使你和Jin能够重聚
If there's a way for you and Jin to be together again,

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,044
如果能够找到拯救我们的人的方法
If there's a way to save our people...

112
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:04,017
我一定会找到
I'll find it.

113
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:17,022
别动她
Take it easy on her.

114
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,090
别废话
Don't talk.

115
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,050
明白吗
Understand?

116
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:31,058
你还好吧
Are you okay?

117
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,059
还好
Yeah.

118
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,001
我们被抓之前
You know, before we were caught...

119
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,099
你说我们需要
You said that we needed

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,027
把一切事物扳回原来的轨道
To put things back the way they were supposed to be.

121
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,070
我不明白你的意思
What did you mean by that?

122
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:59,072
如果我们能按Faraday说的做
If we can do what Faraday said...

123
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,073
我们的飞机就不会坠落
Our plane never crashes...

124
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,037
815航班会在洛杉矶安然降落
Flight 815 lands in los angeles.

125
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:10,018
我们到这里以后所有死去的人
And everyone we lost since we got here...

126
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,069
现在应该都还活着
They'd all be alive.

127
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,000
那我们俩呢
And what about us?

128
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,046
我们只是
We just...

129
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:23,000
依旧过着自己的生活
Go on living our life

130
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:26,067
只因为我们素未谋面吗
Because we've never met?

131
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:30,030
我们经历过的种种不幸
All the misery that we've been through...

132
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,071
都会烟消云散  就像从未发生过
We'd just wipe it clean. never happened.

133
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,021
不全是不幸
It was not all misery.

134
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:44,077
那也够人受的
Enough of it was.

135
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,094
我击中的那个人
The man I shot...

136
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:58,006
他要氢弹干什么
What did he need the bomb for?

137
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,008
告诉我  他要那氢弹做什么
I need you to tell me why he wanted the bomb.

138
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:09,023
我说了你也不会信
I don't think you'd believe me if I did.

139
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,011
我17岁时
When I was 17 years old,

140
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:21,012
我带一个年轻人去找炸弹
I took a young man to the bomb.

141
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:24,026
接着他告诉我  如果我们把它给埋了
He proceeded to tell me that if we buried it underground,

142
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:26,062
将会是一大壮举
Then things would work out splendidly.

143
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:31,034
我问他我为什么如此肯定
When I asked him how he could be so sure...

144
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:34,059
他说他来自未来
He said that he was from the future.

145
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,083
说完就消失了
And then he disappeared,

146
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:42,004
就在我眼前消失得无影无踪
Right in front of my bloody eyes.

147
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:44,046
十分钟前
Ten minutes ago,

148
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:48,078
我击中了那人的背部
I shot that man in the back.

149
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,020
他临死前
And before he... died...

150
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:56,009
告诉我
He told me that he...

151
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,022
他说是我儿子
He said he was my son.

152
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,060
告诉我详情
Explain to me...

153
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:08,058
我保证我会深信不疑
And you have my word I will believe you.

154
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:15,087
这怎么会是我的笔记  我却一点没印象
How is this my handwriting if i don't remember writing it?

155
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,053
因为你还没动笔
Because you haven't written it yet.

156
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:28,034
我知道这很难理解
I know this is hard to understand,

157
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,052
但
But...

158
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:32,031
你刚才做的事
What you just did...

159
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:35,081
是场意外
It was an accident,

160
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:39,080
有办法可以挽回这一切
And I think that there's a way for you to take it all back.

161
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:42,013
什么
What?

162
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:43,073
你儿子回到这里
Your son came back here

163
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:48,046
是因为他找到了破解之法
Because he had figured out a way to change things.

164
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:49,052
他不必死
He doesn't have to be dead.

165
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:51,080
你也没必要杀了他
You don't have to have killed him.

166
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:55,021
如果我们按照那篇日志上记载的做
If we do what's written in that journal...

167
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,014
这一切就不会发生
None of this will have happened.

168
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:06,030
他是不是不知所云
Does he know what he's talking about?

169
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:09,039
他自认为头脑清楚
He thinks he does.

170
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:21,029
那好吧  我带你去找炸弹
All right then, I'll take you to the bomb.

171
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:24,045
只是
Just...

172
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:27,074
可我得先说清楚
One small issue, however.

173
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:30,063
20多年前我们把炸弹埋在地下
We secured it over 20 years ago underground.

174
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:32,054
可那时起
But since that time,

175
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:36,021
有人在那里建造了整个村庄
It appears that someone's built an entire village over it.

176
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:40,031
达摩组织吗
The dharma initiative?

177
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,019
但是
However...

178
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,027
看来你们俩
It appears that you two

179
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:47,057
也是他们的成员
Have been passing yourselves off as members, so...

180
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,056
我想你们的行动会相对容易一些
I suppose coming and going will be relatively simple.

181
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:55,048
没你想像中那么简单
Ah, it might be a little bit more complicated than that.

182
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:12,063
那女人  现在在哪里
That woman-- where is she now?

183
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:17,010
找我的律师谈
Call my lawyer.

184
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,076
Stuart  你到底在干什么
Stuart! what the hell are you doing?

185
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:23,066
我在逼供  她在哪里
I'm getting answers. where is she?!

186
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,072
住手  该死  住手
Hey. hey! stop! damn it, stop.

187
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,006
我命令你  现在还是我说了算
That is an order. i'm still in charge here.

188
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,015
不  以前是你说了算  Horace
No, you were in charge, Horace.

189
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:35,023
可我们要想保护自己人
But if we're gonna protect our people

190
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,049
和我们付出的所有艰辛劳动
And all the work we're doing here,

191
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,044
接下来的事  你是应付不过来的
You don't have the stomach for what happens next.

192
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,015
Phil
Phil.

193
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,094
Jim  给你最后一次机会
Okay, Jim, last chance.

194
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:02,053
你告诉我她在哪
You tell me where she is...

195
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,008
不然我就宰了你
Or so help me god, I will kill you.

196
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:20,098
现在准备招出来吗
You ready to talk now?

197
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,098
不
Nope.

198
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,090
相信我  Jim  我也厌倦了这样
Believe me, I'm gettin' tired of this too, Jim.

199
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:29,091
招了吧
So why don't you tell me

200
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,088
你女朋友带那孩子去了哪
Where your girlfriend took the boy?

201
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:34,096
把他带去投奔敌人了吗
She bring him to the hostiles?

202
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:37,097
你知道他们在那里吗
You know where they are?

203
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,039
住手
Stop!

204
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,041
-求你了  -你想让我住手吗
- Please! - You want me to stop?

205
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:48,050
那就回答我的问题
Then tell me what I want to know!

206
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:51,018
Stuart  求你了
Stuart, please.

207
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:54,061
我们认识有3年了
We have known each other for three years.

208
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:58,097
我们不是坏人  我们不是来伤害你的
We are not bad people! We are not here to hurt you!

209
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,089
Juliet
Juliet...

210
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,002
不要
Don't.

211
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,077
不管你说什么
Whatever you tell 'em,

212
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,024
他们都不会相信的
They ain't gonna believe you.

213
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:13,086
只会伤及无辜
It's only gonna get more people hurt.

214
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,020
我们在干什么
What are we doing, man?

215
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,057
打他没用  好吗  他不会招的
Beating him is pointless. Okay? He's not gonna talk.

216
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:25,043
我能敲开他的嘴
I can make him talk.

217
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:34,088
混蛋
Son of a bitch!

218
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,077
冷静冷静
Easy. Easy.

219
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,036
Phil  你死定了
You're a dead man, Phil.

220
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:43,060
我要杀了你
I'm gonna kill you.

221
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,033
Radzinsky先生
Mr. Radzinsky?

222
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:47,081
还是没有Miles和Jin的消息
There's still no sign of Miles or Jin.

223
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:49,089
但上星期新来的人
But the recruits from last week...

224
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,056
我从Amy那里找到了潜艇运载名单
I got their sub's manifest from Amy.

225
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,077
有三个人最后才临时加进来

226
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,040
其中两人是枪击你的
They were the two people that shot at you--

227
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,097
Shephard和Austen  还有一人尚未查出
Shephard and austen-- and one guy we can't track down.

228
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,031
他一定也参与了这事
He's gotta be a part of this.

229
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:04,062
Hugo Reyes是谁
Who the hell is Hugo Reyes?

230
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,041
那个胖子
He's the fat guy.

231
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:44,082
营救计划是怎样的
So what's the rescue plan?

232
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,081
营救计划  我们正向海滩走
Rescue plan? we're heading to the beach.

233
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,023
不然你以为  为什么派你去拿食物
Why do you think we sent you for food?

234
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,044
但Sawyer和Juliet他们

235
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:54,010
他们有30人  都有枪
And there are 30 of them, and they all have guns.

236
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:56,045
我们只能自救  走吧
The only people we can rescue is our ourselves, so let's go.

237
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:57,039
我们不能坐视不管
We gotta do something.

238
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,060
Sawyer不会抛弃我们的
I mean, Sawyer would never leave us behind.

239
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:10,040
张博士  你在这做什么
Dr. Chang? What are you doing here?

240
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,087
我也想问你们这个问题
I could ask you the same question.

241
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:16,076
我们先问的
But we asked you first.

242
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,071
你们的朋友Faraday
Your friend Faraday

243
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:21,025
说你们来自未来
Said that you were from the future.

244
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:24,091
我想知道他说的是否属实
I need to know if he was telling the truth.

245
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,067
这太荒谬了
Dude, that's ridiculous.

246
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:32,011
你生于哪年
What year were you born?

247
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:35,030
1931年
Uh... 1931?

248
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:36,076
你46了吗
You're 46?

249
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:38,063
是啊
Yeah.

250
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:39,014
是的
Yes, I am.

251
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,046
那你朝鲜战争中参战了吗
So you fought in the Korean War?

252
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:46,013
没这回事
There's no such thing.

253
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:50,023
谁是美国总统
Who's the president of the united states?

254
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:56,084
好吧  我们是来自未来  抱歉
All right, dude, we're from the future. sorry.

255
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:00,074
那就是真的了吗
It's true then?

256
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:05,009
你是我儿子
You are my son?

257
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:09,089
是啊
Yeah, it's true.

258
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:14,097
你朋友  那个物理学家
Your friend--the physicist--

259
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:18,002
他让我撤离岛上的所有人
He also told me to evacuate everyone I could off the island.

260
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,059
他说
He said there was going to be a

261
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,009
天鹅站会有场巨大的事故
Massive accident at the Swan

262
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,042
这是真的吗
Now is that true?

263
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:28,053
目前为止他都是正确的
He's been right about everything so far.

264
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:32,009
如果Faraday要岛上所有人撤离
If Faraday said get people off the island...

265
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,021
我会照做
I'd do it.

266
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:44,027
那就但愿他头脑清醒
Well, then let's hope he knows what he's doing.

267
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,032
告诉我吧
Tell me something.

268
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:56,029
为什么这人看起来
Why is it that this man looks...

269
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,006
如此眼熟
Familiar to me?

270
00:18:58,007 --> 00:18:59,098
Richard
Richard...

271
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,000
你和Erik跟我走
You and Erik are coming with me.

272
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,009
跟你去哪里
Going with you where?

273
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,029
给他松绑
You can untie them.

274
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:11,047
不介意让我们独处一会吧
Would you mind giving us a moment?

275
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:25,086
我带他们去找炸弹
I'm taking them to the bomb.

276
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:27,061
什么
What?

277
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,090
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

278
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:33,094
我很担心你
I'm worried about you.

279
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:36,051
你现在状态不好
Not in your condition.

280
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,086
他是谁
Who is he?

281
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:49,027
Jack  那是Charles Widmore
The man you're asking about, Jack, is Charles Widmore.

282
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:55,027
他和Eloise是
He and Eloise are...

283
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:59,021
爱情真复杂
Well, let's just say love can be complicated.

284
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:07,038
好的  我们走吧
All right. let's move out.

285
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,025
John
So, John...

286
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:15,085
你打算告诉我
You, uh, you ready to tell me

287
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:18,062
这三年你都去哪里了
Where you've been the last three years?

288
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:21,043
你真的不知道吗
You really don't know?

289
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:25,005
我只知道  当Ben转动了转轮
Well, i know that on the day that Ben here turned the wheel

290
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:28,008
你和我就站在一个木板上
That you and i were sitting on a log.

291
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,082
有强烈的白光和噪音
There was a bright light. there was a loud noise,

292
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:34,048
然后你就  就消失了
And then you just... you disappeared.

293
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:36,026
Richard你马上就可以看到
Well, Richard, you're just about

294
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,096
我也消失过的地方
to see where i disappeared too.

295
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:40,004
而当我们把事情完成
And after we're finished with that,

296
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:44,015
我要你带我去见Jacob
I'd like you to take me to see Jacob.

297
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:47,022
John  这不符合规矩
That's... not how it works, John.

298
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:51,000
真的吗  Richard  会有什么问题吗
Is that true, Richard? is this gonna be a problem?

299
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,016
你刚回来而已  John
You just got back, John.

300
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,061
没必要那么着急就
There's no reason to rush into--

301
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:58,058
我现在是你们的带头人吧
I am the leader now. right?

302
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:00,088
是的没错  John
Yes, John. that's right.

303
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:04,001
好  那我要你带我去见Jacob
Good. then i would like you to take me to Jacob.

304
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:07,027
-你能带我去吗  -当然
-Can you do that? yeah  -of course.

305
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:09,016
非常好
Fantastic.

306
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,023
我们继续走  快要到飞机那里了
Let's keep moving. we're almost to the plane.

307
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:15,066
什么飞机
What plane?

308
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:37,019
一架走私海洛因的飞机
It's a beechcraft-- used to smuggle heroin.

309
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,022
从尼日利亚起飞  在这里失事
Flew out of nigeria, crashed here.

310
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,004
现在 你仔细听好了  Richard
All right, Richard, listen very carefully

311
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:44,038
因为你只有大概三分钟的时间
Because you're only gonna have about three minutes

312
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:47,020
-把事情做好  -把什么做好
-To get this right.   -Get what right?

313
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,024
一个男的将要走出丛林
A man's about to walk out of the jungle.

314
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:52,092
但是他的脚被射伤了
He's been shot in the leg.

315
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:56,000
你需要这些把子弹取出来
You'll need this to get the bullet out.

316
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,058
我没听懂  John
Uh, i'm sorry, John. i'm not--

317
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,019
你现在仔细听好  这是最重要的一点
Now just listen. this is the important part.

318
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,028
你一定要告诉他
You're gonna need to tell him

319
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:08,083
他必须让所有离开岛的人回到岛上
That he has to bring everyone who left back to the island.

320
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:12,034
当他问该怎么办的时候
And when he asks how to do that...

321
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:15,048
你告诉他他必须死去
You tell him he's gonna have to die.

322
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:29,091
那个男的是谁  John
Who is that man, John?

323
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:32,076
我
Me.

324
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:05,069
Richard
Richard?

325
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:07,040
Richard
Richard...

326
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,010
到底发生了什么事
What is happening?

327
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:13,071
发生了什么  你会失血过多死去
What's happening is that you're bleeding to death.

328
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,084
我需要你把子弹取出来
I need to get the bullet out.

329
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,084
你怎么知道有子弹在我腿里
How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?

330
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:28,039
是你告诉我的  John
Because you told me there was, John.

331
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,058
不  不  不  我没有
No, no. no, i didn't.

332
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:35,000
是的  你将会告诉我的
Well... you will.

333
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,063
这种灵魂出窍的感觉很好吧
This must be quite the out-of-body experience.

334
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:43,003
感觉可以
Something like that.

335
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,009
你计算的天衣无缝  John
Your timing was impeccable, John.

336
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,039
你是怎么知道该什么时候出现在这里的
How did you know when to be here?

337
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,022
这个岛告诉我的
The island told me.

338
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:54,013
它从未告诉过你什么吧
Didn't it ever tell you things?

339
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:57,070
很明显它没告诉你Jacob在哪里啊  John
No, John. and clearly it hasn't told you where Jacob is,

340
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:59,052
否则你也不需要Richard告诉你
Or you wouldn't need Richard to show you

341
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:01,042
你从未见过他
you' ve never seen him

342
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:02,068
什么
What?

343
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:06,044
Jacob  你从未见过他
Jacob. you've never seen him, have you?

344
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:17,055
刚才发生了什么
What just happened?

345
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:20,016
你去了哪里
Where did you go?

346
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,055
去把指南针还给Richard
To give Richard his compass back.

347
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:31,058
你要这个子弹吗
You want the bullet?

348
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,015
你留着吧
Keep it.

349
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:36,000
一切还好吧
Everything go all right?

350
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:38,043
你的话还是挺有说服力的
Well, you-ou seemed pretty convinced,

351
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,031
尤其是当我说你将会死去的时候
Especially when i said you were gonna die.

352
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:43,089
让我欣慰的是这并没有发生
I'm certainly glad that didn't have to happen.

353
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,072
事实上  Richard  已经发生了
Actually, Richard, it did.

354
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:55,093
我们还是回到营地吧
We better get back to camp.

355
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,051
你需要撤离这个岛上所有的人
You need to evacuate the island

356
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:09,004
所有无关的人员
of all nonessen

357
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:12,003
你需要去...
And you need to do it...

358
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,012
这里发生了什么
What the hell is going on here?

359
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,027
张博士  你不是应该在天鹅站吗
Aren't you supposed to be at the swan right now, Chang?

360
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:17,084
我们应该在20个小时内把井打通
We're supposed to break ground in less than 20 hours.

361
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:19,001
我们受到了威胁
We're under imminent threat.

362
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:20,076
如果我们开始钻井
If we start drilling,

363
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:23,030
将很有可能会发生灾难性的事件
There's a high probability of a cataclysmic accident.

364
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,061
我们按照计划继续钻井
We are drilling and on schedule.

365
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:28,091
Horace你来负责这里
Horace, you're in charge.

366
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:31,051
他再也不是负责人了
he's not in charge anymore.

367
00:25:31,052 --> 00:25:35,041
这是我的决定  我说的算
This is my decision, and it's been made.

368
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:38,044
-我们继续钻井  -把我们带到潜水艇去
-We keep working.   -put us on the sub.

369
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:47,041
他是对的  这里不安全了
He's right. it ain't safe.

370
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:49,095
把妇女孩子带到潜水艇去
Put the women and children on the sub

371
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:53,005
让他们离开这里
And get 'em the hell out of here.

372
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,081
如果你把我和Juliet带到潜水艇
And if you put me and Juliet on the sub with 'em...

373
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:03,087
我们会告诉你一切
We'll tell you anything you wanna know.

374
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:12,029
这样可以了吧  亲爱的
You okay with that, sweetheart?

375
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,003
是的
Absolutely.

376
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:18,036
Jim你也进潜水艇吧
You want on that sub, Jim?

377
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:23,090
画个地图给我
Draw me a map.

378
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,004
我要知道敌人的具体位置
I wanna know exactly where the hostiles are.

379
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:42,015
你们两个会游泳吗
You two know how to swim?

380
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:44,077
我们就在上面看看不行吗
Why don't we just go around it?

381
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:47,034
不  我们要下去
No, dear, we need to go in.

382
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:50,057
潜到水底进入隧道
We have to swim under the pond to get to the tunnels.

383
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:52,044
我不去
I'm not going.

384
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:53,098
什么
What?

385
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:57,003
我要回去找其他人  我...
I'm gonna go back and find everyone else. i...

386
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:59,019
我这次不能再跟你走了Jack
I can't go any further with you Jack. not this time.

387
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,072
Kate  你现在不能回去  他们认识我们
Kate, you can't go back there now. they know about us.

388
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:04,098
他们会杀了我们的
They... they tried to kill us.

389
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:08,070
那你打算怎么办
And what are you trying to do?

390
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,087
再见  Jack
Bye, Jack.

391
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:14,046
哪都别去
You're not going anywhere.

392
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:15,095
不  别这样
No, you don't need to do that.

393
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:18,030
我们没有跟陌生人说出秘密
We're not in the habit of telling our secrets

394
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,026
然后让他们随便就走的习惯
To strangers, then just letting them saunter off.

395
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:23,022
我才不关这些  我要走了
You know, i don't care i just wanna leave.

396
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,024
把枪放下  都放下枪
Look, just put the gun-- step ay!

397
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,083
别开枪  如果她想走  就让她走
Hey! i said stop! if she wants to leave, she can leave!

398
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
我们在干什么  Eloise
What are we doing here, eloise?

399
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,005
那个人刚刚杀了一个我们的人
That man just killed one of our own people,

400
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,008
可是你却好像什么都没发生一样
And you're acting like it doesn't matter.

401
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,013
如果他们说的那些事
If these people are right

402
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:59,098
都是真的  Richard  就没事了
About what they're about to do, richard, it won't matter.

403
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:02,087
他们要干什么
And what are they about to do?

404
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:04,058
你告诉我
So you're telling me

405
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,095
你要把我们过去三年的生活都删除
You're going to erase the last three years of our lives?

406
00:28:06,095 --> 00:28:08,028
我们可以改变这些事  Sayid
We can change things, sayid.

407
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:09,043
我不知道你们能不能
I don't know if you're aware of this

408
00:28:09,043 --> 00:28:11,044
可是我已经改变了一些事了
But i've already changed things.

409
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,004
我杀了Benjamin Linus
I killed benjamin linus,

410
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:18,006
可是我们现在还在这  那是因为你没杀他
And we're all still here. it's because you didn't kill him.

411
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:20,057
Sawyer和我把他带到了岛上居民那里
Sawyer and me took him to the others

412
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:24,058
他们可以救他
So that they could save him.

413
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:29,002
你为什么这么做
Why did you do that?

414
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:31,006
我为什么这么做
Why did i do that?

415
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:34,009
向孩子开枪 投氢弹
Since when did shooting kids and blowing up hydrogen bombs

416
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,083
难道就对了嘛
Become okay?

417
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:37,031
我们的三个人
The three of us disappeared off

418
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,072
放弃了那个计划
that plane and

419
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:42,023
因为只有这样我们才能改变未来
Ended up now, because this is our chance to change things.

420
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:46,024
可是如果你们错了  岛上的所有人都会死
And if you're wrong, then everyone on the island dies.

421
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:47,020
你明白吗
Do you understand that?

422
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,024
我没有错 Kate 这就是我在这的原因
I'm not wrong kate, this is it, this is why we're here.

423
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,059
这是我们的命运
This is our destiny.

424
00:28:56,088 --> 00:29:00,066
知道你说话的语气像谁吗
Do you know who you sound like?

425
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:03,097
因为他也疯了  Jack  你是这样说的
Because he was crazy, too, jack. you said so yourself.

426
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,022
好吧  或许是我错了
Well, maybe i was wrong.

427
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:08,093
不  你是对的
No, you were right.

428
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:12,084
我要回去找他们
I'm going back to find the rest of our people,

429
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:17,033
我不能阻止你  他们也许可以
Because if i can't stop you, then maybe they can.

430
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,038
潜艇将在30分钟内离开
The submarine departs in 30 minutes.

431
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,050
所有撤离人员  请马上到码头上来
All evacuees, please proceed to the dock.

432
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:37,020
快点  Charlotte  跟我来
Come now, charlotte. stay with me.

433
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:42,027
这太可笑了  我可以帮你
This is ridiculous. i can help you.

434
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:45,013
不  Lara  你帮不了我  离开这
No, lara, you can't. just go over there.

435
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:49,055
我要你现在马上离开
I want you to leave now!

436
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:52,040
为什么他对她喊  老兄
Why is he yelling at her, dude?

437
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:57,006
这是他让她走的唯一方法
It's the only way he can get her to leave.

438
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:00,061
对不起  伙计
Sorry, man.

439
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:01,015
我们最好马上走
We'd better get going.

440
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:03,064
等等  等一会
Wait! whoa! whoa! wait--wait a second.

441
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:05,084
是Jim和Juliet
It's jim and juliet.

442
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:08,066
为什么那些人
Why the hell are they...

443
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:11,027
要把他们放到潜艇上
Putting them on the sub?

444
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:17,080
别担心  没事的
Don't worry. it's gonna be okay.

445
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:20,042
Sawyer会有办法的  对吗
Sawyer always has a plan, right?

446
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:26,099
我们会买下微软
We'll buy microsoft.

447
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,001
什么
Excuse me?

448
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:32,063
这样我们就能在78届超级杯赛上下注小牛队
Then we'll bet the cowboys in the '78 super bowl.

449
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:36,010
我们会变的很富有
We're gonna be rich.

450
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:38,096
对不起
Look, i'm sorry.

451
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:40,004
我应该听你的
I should've listened to you

452
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,013
三年前让你上这艘潜艇
When you wanted to get on this sub three years ago.

453
00:30:43,014 --> 00:30:46,051
很高兴你现在对我说这些
I'm glad you talked me out of it.

454
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:55,035
快点  Lafleur  进去
Come on, lafleur. get in.

455
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:59,067
女士优先
Ladies first.

456
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,060
终于解脱了
Good riddance.

457
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,069
如果在那边我没见到你
If i don't see you the other side,

458
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:43,004
我不会怪你的
I won't blame you.

459
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:50,047
深吸一口气  跟上Richard
Now take a deep breath and follow richard under.

460
00:31:50,047 --> 00:31:52,025
在石头下面
There's an opening in the bottom

461
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:54,040
有一个入口
of the rocks a獴?鷐???

462
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,022
比我想的远多了
That was a lot further than i thought it was.

463
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,095
我们在哪
Where are we?

464
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:54,025
隧道
The tunnels.

465
00:32:56,055 --> 00:32:59,052
我们怎么把炸弹带出这里
You wanna tell me how we're gonna get a bomb out of here?

466
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:02,006
怎么带进来的就怎么带出去
The same way we brought it in.

467
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:04,060
你不会是指通过池塘带出去吧
I assume you don't mean through the pool.

468
00:33:04,061 --> 00:33:07,014
这可是12英尺长  40000磅的氢弹
It's a 12-foot long, 40,000-pound hydrogen bomb.

469
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:09,068
不  不是从池塘
No, not through the pool.

470
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,071
没想到你也来了
I didn't think you'd come.

471
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:37,080
如果这样有用的话  我们都会得救的
Well, if this works, you might just save us all.

472
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:42,023
如果没有用呢  至少会让我们从痛苦中解脱出来
And if it doesn't? at least u'll put us out of our misery.

473
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:55,000
好了  我们开始吧
All right. let's get started.

474
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:34,077
我给你准备了一个帐篷  John
I'll have a tent prepared for you, john.

475
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:36,085
我们明早第一件事就去那
We'll get going first thing in the morning.

476
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,090
我想我们现在就可以出发
I thought we could leave right now.

477
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,081
现在
Now?

478
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:44,051
我很性急
I'm eager.

479
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:50,044
我们可以听你吩咐  但也许我们
We can do whatever you want, but maybe the two of us

480
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,024
该去我帐篷里面讨论一下
Should go to my tent and talk about

481
00:34:51,024 --> 00:34:53,009
所有人都在这里吗
Is this everyone?

482
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:56,009
神庙那里还有另一组人  但
Well, there's another group at the temple, but--

483
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:58,014
如果你不介意
Well, if you don't mind,

484
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:01,062
我现在想和每个人都谈谈
I would like to talk to everyone here now.

485
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:04,058
当然可以  随便
Of course. Be my guest.

486
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,016
大家好
Hello, everyone.

487
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:16,011
我叫John Locke
My name is John Locke.

488
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:18,017
有人告诉我
I've been told that...

489
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:20,025
有段时间
For some time,

490
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:23,059
你们要听从一个叫Jacob的人
You all have been accepting orders from a man named Jacob.

491
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,032
是的  非常奇怪
And yet, oddly enough,

492
00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:28,072
似乎没人真正见过他
It seems that no one has actually seen him.

493
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:31,030
现在我肯定对于  为什么他的存在
Now I'm sure there are very good reasons

494
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:34,043
和他到底在哪  都是秘密  这都有合理原因
Why his existence and where abouts are secret.

495
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:37,040
而我不知道原因到底是什么
I just don't know what they are.

496
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:42,014
老实跟你们说
And to be honest with all of you,

497
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,090
如果有人要命令我们该做什么
If there's a man telling us what to do,

498
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,091
我要知道他是谁
I want to know who he is.

499
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:49,089
那个人  Jacob  他能告诉我们
This man--Jacob? Can he tell us

500
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:53,050
如何把Jin和我们其他人带回这里吗
How to bring Jin and the rest of our people back here?

501
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,052
绝对可以
Absolutely.

502
00:35:58,044 --> 00:36:02,074
Richard已经答应告诉我们该去哪里
Richard has agreed to show us where we need to go.

503
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:06,093
那么我现在就要去见Jacob
So I'm gonna go and see Jacob right now.

504
00:36:09,057 --> 00:36:13,068
而且我希望大家都和我一起去
And I'd like all of you to come with me.

505
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:28,074
我开始觉得John Locke会是个麻烦
I'm starting to think John Locke is gonna be trouble.

506
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:32,022
你凭什么认为我会杀他呢
Why do you think I tried to kill him?

507
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,075
我们两分钟后离开
We're shovin' off in two minutes.

508
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:52,025
如果你们不给我们带来麻烦的话我会很感激的
Appreciate it if you didn't cause us any trouble.

509
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:55,035
Nemo  我们不会的
Wouldn't think of it, Nemo.

510
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:58,098
我们到了安娜堡市后该干什么呢
What are we gonna do en we get to Ann Arbor?

511
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:02,051
我们不去安娜堡市
We ain't going to Ann Arbor.

512
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:05,037
-你是什么意思  -这些人又不是警察
- What do you mean? - These guys ain't cops.

513
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:08,096
他们在现实世界没有权利管我们
They got no authority over us back in the real world

514
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:12,078
所以不管我们在哪里上了岸
So once we dock wherever we dock...

515
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,053
我们就自由了
We're free.

516
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:17,094
现实世界
"Real world."

517
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:25,048
我甚至不记得那是什么意思了
I don't even know what that means anymore.

518
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:28,052
过来
Hey, come here.

519
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:39,050
无论发生什么事  我会支持你的记得吗
Whatever happens, I got your back, remember?

520
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:42,057
我爱你
I love you.

521
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:44,079
我也爱你
I love you back.

522
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,095
拿好  别关了船舱
Hold on! Don't close the hatch!

523
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:49,048
Horace也想要她离开这岛
Horace wants her off the island, too.

524
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,085
我们到了安娜堡市再对付他们
We'll let Ann Arbor deal with them.

525
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:54,072
在她回来的时候捉到他的
Actually caught her coming back into town.

526
00:37:56,038 --> 00:38:00,063
把他和其他人铐在一起

收起登船梯

全体船员下仓  快点

529
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:36,090
我们离开了  机房  准备

530
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,055
潜艇可以航行

531
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:42,061
全体船员就位  准备下潜

532

538
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:04,006

539
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:28,002
Jack
Jack.

540
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:31,058
但这女人
That this woman's motivation

541
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:32,099
帮我们引爆氢弹的动机
In helping us detonate a hydrogen bomb

542
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,074
只是想消灭达摩组织

543
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:40,066
-是的  但我还是相信她  -为什么

544
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:43,092
因为30年后  就是她
Because 30 years from now, she's the one

545
00:39:43,093 --> 00:39:45,057
告诉我们如何回到这岛上的
Who's gonna tell us how to get back to the island.

546
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:49,056
因为这个你就相信她
And that makes you trust her?

547
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:38,041
现在怎么办
Now what?

548
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:17,068
美好的一天  不是吗
Beautiful day, isn't it?

顾虑什么
Concerns about what?

552
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,064

553

他表示 对你自己知道与否

我知道我们过去有分歧  John
I know we've had our differences in the past, John,

558
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:48,011
但是现在我是你的手下
But I'm here to follow you now.

559
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:51,024

560
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,070

561
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:55,036
让我们的人重聚没有兴趣
Interested in being reunited with my people.

562
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,057
什么意思  你告诉Sun

我知道我告诉了她什么

564
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,087
但那不是我们要去找Jacob的原因
But that's not why we're going to Jacob.

565
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:05,051
那为什么我们要去找Jacob
Then why are we going to Jacob?

566
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:09,024
因为那样我可以杀了他
So I can kill him.
