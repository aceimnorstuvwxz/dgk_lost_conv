1
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:03,030
我们这是在哪儿?
Guys... where are we?

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,038
我在沙滩上找到了一条金属线
I found the wire on the beach.

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,073
我以为这和我们用信号接收器收到的
I thought it might have something to do with the transmission we picked up.

4
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:14,047
一个法国女人重复说了16年的话  会有点关系
with a Frenchwoman repeating on a loop for 16 years.

5
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:16,016
真的有这么久了么?
Has it really been that long?

6
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:18,003
是你
You.

7
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:19,038
你们的人...
Your people,

8
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,013
那些你决定了要回到他们那儿去的人...
the ones you're determined to get back to.

9
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,042
看紧他们
I'm alone now. Watch them closely.

10
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:30,008
我正在睡觉  一下子惊醒了  他正打算伤害我的孩子
On the island alone. I mean, I was sleeping, and I woke up,

11
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,072
我们必须弄清楚每个人是谁
We gotta find out who everyone is.

12
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,084
你想弄个人口普查?
Wanna start a census?

13
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:35,045
我问了在沙滩上的每一个人
I interviewed everyone at the beach.

14
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,059
Jack

15
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:39,066
其中一个不在旅客名单上
One of them isn't in the manifest.

16
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:41,091
他不是我们飞机上的人
He wasn't on the plane.

17
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:46,038
我们不是这个岛上唯一的一群人
We're not the only people on this island,

18
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:52,097
他们攻击我们  妨害我们  绑架我们  谋杀我们
They've attacked us! Sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us.

19
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,024
也许是时候该考虑一下怎么去对付他们了
Maybe it's time we started worrying about them.

20
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:00,071
Danielle?

21
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,040
你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:06,093
当我看见黑烟的时候
When I saw black smoke...

23
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:10,042
你们只有3个选择...
You have only three choices.

24
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:20,064
我现在可以告诉你的是我们确实有了一个计划
All I can tell you is we do have a plan.

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,017
是的  你们到丛林里去找炸药然后炸开一个舱门
Go into the jungle, get some dynamite, blow open a hatch,

26
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,082
然后就可以让大家躲在里面了
and then you hide everyone inside.

27
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:28,062
天知道那些炸药在那儿多久了
God knows how long that dynamite has been out there.

28
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:31,001
所以如果你不想被炸飞的话
So, unless you want to blow up,

29
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,010
就让我一起去
I'm coming with you.

30
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:38,043
-祝你好运  -你也一样
-Good luck.  -Same to you.

31
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,069
马上会再见面的
See you soon.

32
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:45,000
扶正了
Keep it straight.

33
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:53,005

好了  推  推
Go, go!

35
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:04,032
再见了  Vincent
Bye, Vincent.

36
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,061
Claire  大家都准备走了
Claire. Everybody's leaving.

37
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,028
是的  我哪儿也不能去  行么?
Well, I can't go anywhere, all right?

38
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,030
我有个孩子  我太累了
I've got the baby and I'm... I'm so tired.

39
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,071
我不能带着他
I can't... can't carry him.

40
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:38,055
现在他又尿湿了
And now he's wet

41
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:42,011
边上又到处是沙子  我没有别的尿布了
and there's sand everywhere. I don't have anymore nappies.

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,024
你怎么不让我帮忙?
Why don't you let me help?

43
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,005
不  听着  没人和我说过这该怎么办
No, look, nobody ever taught me how to do this. Okay?

44
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:47,077
Claire  会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

45
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,083
为什么大家都对我这么说?
Why do people keep telling me that?

46
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:51,059
他们难道也有孩子么?
Are they the ones with the baby?

47
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:55,021
我们得在太阳下山前赶到那儿
We've got to get there before sundown.

48
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:57,021
一旦你们到了洞里  就呆在那儿
Once you reach the caves, stay there.

49
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:59,037
其他的人会马上到的
The rest of us will be right behind you.

50
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,028
听着  我知道Jack把它们给你了
I know Jack gave 'em to you.

51
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:11,001
我现在就要一把  我想保护Claire
I want one right now. I have to protect Claire.

52
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,031
Rousseau说那些人在黄昏的时候才会来
Rousseau said the others won't be here till night.

53
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:15,067
Rousseau是可以相信  但万一他们提前来了呢...
She's certifiable. What if they show up before?

54
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:17,011
上次你用枪的时候...
Last time you had a sidearm...

55
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:19,037
我杀了一个杀人犯  我帮了大家
I killed a murderer. I did us a favor.

56
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,044
Charlie  你控制不了你的情绪  那些枪由我来处理
You're emotionally involved. Let me handle the weapons.

57
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:25,017
你不会永远都在这里  你保护不了Claire  听着  我要一把枪
You're not here all the time. You can't protect her. I need a gun.

58
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,041
如果你真的想要帮Claire
If you want to help Claire

59
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:29,020
就帮她去整理东西  帮她把孩子带去山洞那里
get her packed, carry her child to the caves.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,074
那才是她需要的
That's what she needs.

61
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,087
像这样的事怎么会发生的?
How exactly does something like this happen?

62
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,031
你和我在同在这个岛上  不是么?
Are you on the same island as I am?

63
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,040
这个解释还算不错
I guess that explains it.

64
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,064
停下  停下  等等  停下  等等
Hold on, wait... Hold, wait.

65
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,007
我们在哪儿  在几英里深的岛内陆?
What are we, a couple miles inland?

66
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:17,024
海啸是有可能把这东西刮过来的  是么?
A tsunami probably swept it here. Huh? Right?

67
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,012
你去哪儿?
Hey.Hey, where are you going?

68
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,008
炸药就在船体里
The explosives are in the hold of the ship.

69
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:24,094
Rousseau  等等
Rousseau, wait.

70
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:29,043
你吩咐的我都做了
I did what you asked.

71
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,089
你需要的是炸药  你不需要我了
You need dynamite. You don't need me.

72
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:35,046
让她去吧  Jack
Let her go, Jack.

73
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,047
谁带我们回去?
Who's gonna lead us back?

74
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,087
我会带大家回去的
I'll lead us back.

75
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,044
混蛋
Damn it.

76
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:52,096
你听她说了吧  炸药就在船体里面  我们走吧
You heard her. Explosives are in the hold. Let's go.

77
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:54,016
等等  等等
Hold on.

78
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,006
我来这儿是告诉你们怎样处理炸药
I came here to tell you how to handle dynamite,

79
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,036
不是和你们去鬼船探险的
not explore a ghost ship.

80
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,030
-你认为我会去...  -好了  好的  就呆在这儿吧
-You think...  -Just... stay out here.

81
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:09,025
我也和Arnzt一起呆在外面
I'm gonna stay out here and hang with Arnzt.

82
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:03,078
是奴隶
Slaves.

83
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:16,035
这艘船一定是准备去一个采矿的殖民地的
This ship must have been en route to a mining colony.

84
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:21,025
可能是从非洲的东海岸莫桑比克起航的
Probably set off from the eastern coast of Africa.

85
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,035
Jack  John  来一下
Jack. John. Over here.

86
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:14,041
然后我的第三个妻子  她说... 拿去  她说
and then my third wife, she says, get this,

87
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:15,076
我不是被你雇来的
"I didn't sign up for this."

88
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,070
现在你告诉我  这到底是什么意思?
You tell me, what the hell is that even supposed to mean?

89
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
我打扰你了么?
What, am I boring you?

90
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,026
呃?
Huh?

91
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,013
你知道么?  我...  我很抱歉
You know what? I'm sorry.

92
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:31,081
我...我很抱歉  我不够酷
I'm sorry that I'm not cool enough

93
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:34,058
我不能成为你们快乐的小冒险队的一员
to be part of your merry little band of adventurers.

94
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,022
什么?
What?

95
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:39,012
一看到这个小团体我就能知道  我是教高中的  伙计
I know a clique when I see it. I teach high school, pally!

96
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:45,058
你们这帮人认为你们是在这个岛上唯一做着有价值的事的人
You know, you people think you're the only ones on this island doing anything of value.

97
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,016
坠机事故中还有其他的40个幸存者
There were 40 other survivors of this plane crash,

98
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,069
并且我们也是一份子
and we are all people too.

99
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,088
好的
Okay.

100
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:01,033
你知道么?  我能把它打开一旦...
You know what,I can probably get it open if I just...

101
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,018
不  不  我们得搬出去
No. We should take it outside.

102
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,004
为什么? 我们甚至不知道... 
Why? You don't even know if this...

103
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:08,039
我们不会用镐去撬开一个写有"炸药"的板条箱的  Kate
You're not prying open a crate that says "Explosives" with a pickax.

104
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:10,017
我同意Jack说的
Yeah, I agree with Jack.

105
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,094
我们把它搬出去  在外面打开
Take it outside, open it there.

106
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,067
好吧
Okay.

107
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:17,002
我来搬
I got it.

108
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,069
去带路好么?
You mind showing us the way?

109
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,048
那也不是些十几岁的青少年
It's not just the teenagers.

110
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,032
体育老师  你认为他们在咖啡馆里会让我和他们一起坐么?
The gym teachers,you think they let me sit with them in the cafeteria?

111
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:30,060
不  他们不会
No. They do not.

112
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,033
伙计  那全是你想出来的
This is all in your head.

113
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,095
真的么? 那么你向我解释一下
Really? You explain to me

114
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,095
为什么Kate用来做掩蔽处的飞机残骸是最好的?
why Kategets the best pieces of wreckage for her shelter?

115
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,019
还有那个韩国人...
And the Korean guy.

116
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,030
他抓的鱼分给了这个岛上的每一个人了么?
Does he catch fish for everybody on the island?

117
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,006
不  他没有  他没有
No. He does not. He doesn't.

118
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:47,011
并且在这儿的一些人明显瘦了不少
And some of us have actually lost weight while we were here.

119
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,068
现在你能告诉我你把食物都藏在哪儿了么?
You mind telling me where you're hiding the carbs?

120
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:51,008
因为我想不通...
'Cause I can't figure...

121
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,068
你们这些人到底在做什么?
What the hell are you people doing?

122
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,077
等等  等下  停  就停在那儿
Wait, wait. Stop. Stop right where you are.

123
00:08:57,086 --> 00:09:00,043
好了  我要你们仔细慢慢放下箱子  仔细一点
Put that down carefully. Put it down carefully.

124
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:03,005
放得...轻一点  轻一点  混蛋
Put it gently...Gently. Damn it!

125
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:05,058
仔细一点  轻轻的  轻轻的
Carefully, gently. Gently.

126
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:09,033
好了  马上离开那儿  离远一点
Get outta there. Get away from it. Come on.

127
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,009
快点  走开  离它远点
Get out. Move away from it.

128
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,060
-到底这是...  -嘘  安静点
-What the hell is your...?  -Shh. Be quiet.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,066
你们有人知道么
Do any of you have any idea

130
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,032
给黄色炸药加上90度的热度会怎样?
what happens to dynamite in 90-plus degree heat?

131
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,000
恩? 你们知道么?
Huh? Do you know?

132
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,033
有人知道么?
Any of you?

133
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:36,026
它会化成硝化甘油
It sweats nitroglycerin.

134
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:42,010
你干吗? 我说过让你走近了么?
What are you doing? Did I ask you to come closer?

135
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,014
黄色炸药...
Dynamite...

136
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,093
是用黏土固定的硝化甘油
is nitroglycerine stabilized by clay.

137
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:06,040
硝化甘油是人们所知道的最危险最不稳定的炸药
Nitroglycerine is the most dangerous and unstable explosive known to man.

138
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,059
Kate  把你的衬衣给我
Hey Kate, gimme your shirt.

139
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:15,017
快  公主  把你的衬衣给我  我要把炸药包起来
Now. Princess, give me your shirt. I need to wrap the dynamite.

140
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,025
把它丢给我就好了  小心点
Just throw it to me, right here. Just be careful.

141
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,028
拜托  快点
Come on, hurry up.

142
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:22,028
好了 很好 现在后退 后退 后退
Okay, good. Now back up. Back up.

143
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,031
离我远点
Get outta my way.

144
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,049
你们有人听说过发明硝化甘油的那个人么?
Any of you ever hear about the guy who invented nitroglycerin?

145
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:35,054
也许没有  因为他把自己的脸给炸了
Probably not, because he blew his freaking face off.

146
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:39,069
他的实验室助手进去后
His lab assistant came into the room,

147
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,089
看见他的导师引爆了炸药
saw that his mentor had detonated,

148
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:49,000
说道"恩 我想这东西很管用"
and he said: "Huh. I guess this stuff does work."

149
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,032
好了 我们拿了够用的就好
We're not gonna take more of this stuff than we need,

150
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,095
因为硝化甘油真的是很不稳定
because nitroglycerine is extremely temperamental.

151
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,002
那么我们就...
So we just...

152
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,064
伙计
Dude.

153
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:57,057
先生你的包是没人看管的
Sir, your bag was unattended.

154
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,099
-我可以走了么?  -可以了 先生
-Am I free to go?  -Yes, sir.

155
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,085
我要赶飞机
I have a plane to catch.

156
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:13,084
你能帮我拿一下纸巾么  朋友?
Could you hand me a paper towel there, bud?

157
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,097
一张纸巾  这个坏了
Uh, paper towel, this one's broken.

158
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:22,043
你不懂英语  对不起
Oh. You don't speak English. Sorry.

159
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,024
就是这张纸巾了

160
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:32,011
什么

161
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,056
我是为...

162
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,036
Paik先生工作的

163
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:46,065
你的岳父 也就是你的老板

164
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:50,009
你一直在跟踪我?

165
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,036
是的

166
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:58,000
我知道你打算逃跑

167
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:02,032
但你要把那块表...

168
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:05,060
带给Paik先生在加利福尼亚的朋友

169
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:10,071
如果你做了其他的事...

170
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:12,096
任何事

171
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:15,073
你就会失去她

172
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:20,044
你没有自由

173
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,098
你以前从没有过...

174
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:27,093
将来也不会有

175
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,035
爸爸  看
Dad, look!

176
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:07,066
这么大的一个地方怎么会没有人发现过?
How does a place this big never get discovered?

177
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,037
我不知道
Don't know.

178
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:14,083
但是你能在那儿建一个海滩度假别墅
But you could build yourself one hell of a beach resort right over there.

179
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:17,018
好吧 你去建你的吧
Yeah, you build your resort.

180
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,078
我很开心能和这里永别
I'm happy to say goodbye to this place forever.

181
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:26,039
其他人怎么样了? 他们还好吧?
What about everybody else? Think they'll be okay?

182
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:28,058
希望他们能安全吧  伙计
I hope so, buddy.

183
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,036
至少在我们叫来救援之前
At least until we can get 'em some help.

184
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,003
你在唱Bob Marley的歌?
Singing Bob Marley?

185
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,067
不是
No.

186
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:46,006
怎么了? 你喜欢听Bob Marley?
Why? You like Bob Marley?

187
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:48,028
伙计  有谁不喜欢Bob Marley?
Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley?

188
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,071
混蛋
Damn it!

189
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:43,067
那些东西你都要么?
Do you really need all that?

190
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,035
是的
Yeah. I do.

191
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:47,038
为什么你要带这么多?
Why do you have to bring so much?

192
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,018
你不是要带我们远足么?
Don't you have a hike to lead?

193
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,026
我没事
I'm fine.

194
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:58,042
这些都是你哥哥的东西
These belonged to your brother.

195
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,008
我需要这些东西
I need these things.

196
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,065
我不能抛下它们
I can't just leave them.

197
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,037
我们在做什么?
What are we doing?

198
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:16,042
躲起来?
Hiding?

199
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,029
好像他们找不到我们似的
As if they won't find us.

200
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,078
这只是...
It's just...

201
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,040
负担太重了
It's too much.

202
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,074
这太重了
It's too much.

203
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:31,015
如果我帮你承担一点的话就不会太困难了
It won't be too much if I carry it for you.

204
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:35,089
好了  快点吧
Now come on.

205
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,055
我要带你们远足
I have a hike to lead.

206
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,061
你还好吧?
You okay?

207
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:57,048
真是一团糟
That was messed up.

208
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:02,036
他刚刚...
He just...

209
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,053
被炸死了...
...exploded...

210
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:09,031
就在我们眼前
...in front of us.

211
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:13,081
他只是想帮我们
He was just trying to help.

212
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,061
-都怪我来了  -什么?
-This is because I came.  -What?

213
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:26,097
我...
I'm...

214
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:31,012
是一个扫把星
...kind of bad luck.

215
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,044
那只是一个意外
It was an accident.

216
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:46,056
一个意外
An accident.

217
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:13,018
Locke

218
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:15,051
我们得好好想想
We should think about this.

219
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:18,059
好吧
All right.

220
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:20,059
也许这不是最好的办法
Maybe this isn't the best way.

221
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,032
这是唯一的方法  Jack
It's the only way, Jack.

222
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:02,050
炸开那个舱门我们需要多少炸药?
How many do we need to blow the hatch?

223
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,011
炸开舱门盖要用两根
Two should take care of the hinge.

224
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:07,058
-带三根保险一点  -保险?
-Three to be safe.  -Safe.

225
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:15,029
我把干燥的那些拿掉了  以减少我们运输途中的危险
I'm removing the driest pieces to minimize our risk transporting it.

226
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:21,062
你玩过"军事行动"这个游戏么?
You ever play Operation?

227
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:28,014
当然  别碰到两头
Sure. "Don't touch the sides."

228
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:30,041
我...
I...

229
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:35,054
我总是碰到...
I always got nailed...

230
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:38,085
胳膊肘上
on the funny bone.

231
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:44,079
滋
Bzzzz!

232
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,090
你喜欢玩游戏是么 John?
You like to play games, John?

233
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:57,035
绝对喜欢
Absolutely.

234
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:04,011
好了
Okay.

235
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:06,068
我知道我们赶着逃去山洞那里
I know we're in a rush to escape to the caves,

236
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:09,037
所以我解决了这小家伙的运输问题
so I've solved the Turnip-Head transport issue.

237
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:12,054
这是飞机上的毯子
This is, uh, just a blanket from the plane.

238
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,000
然后我用了这个木头这样穿过这个竹子
And then, this piece of wood here that goes through this bamboo.

239
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,080
就是这个了
Here you go.

240
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,004
一个"bjorn"
It's a bjorn.

241
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,056
一个"bjorn"?
A bjorn?

242
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:28,057
Bjorn 是荷兰语的...襁褓的意思
bjorn. It's Dutch for, uh, baby carrier.

243
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:31,011
-谢谢  -不客气
-Yeah. Thanks.  -Well, that's okay.

244
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:33,033
-谢谢  -哦 谢谢
-Thank you.  -Thanks.

245
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,002
没事儿
That's okay.

246
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:35,022
把他放这儿
Let's put him there.

247
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,001
-Sayid 他在那儿?  -Rousseau 怎么...
-Sayid! Where is he?  -What...?

248
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:41,086
-Sayid 他在哪儿?  -他已经走了
-Sayid, where is he?  -He already left.

249
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:43,064
-我要马上见到他  -Jack和Kate...
-I need him now!  -Jack and Kate?

250
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,036
来不及了  Sayid在哪儿?
There's no time! Where is Sayid?

251
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:48,009
好了  冷静点  好么?  我把他找来
All right, just calm down. I'll get him for you.

252
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:50,062
-呆在这儿  好么?  -好的
-Stay here, all right?  -Okay.

253
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,008
那边发生了什么事?
What happened out there?

254
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:03,007
他叫什么名字?
What is his name?

255
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,044
他叫什么名字?
What is his name?

256
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:09,089
我还没给他取名
Oh, I haven't named him yet.

257
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,059
我可以抱抱他么?
May I hold him?

258
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,027
你为什么要找Sayid?
Um, why do you need Sayid?

259
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:21,079
你不肯让我抱他
You don't want me to hold him?

260
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:26,020
不  我刚喂饱他  我想那样不好 是吧?
No, I just fed him. I don't think it's a good idea. Okay?

261
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,032
拜托
Please!

262
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:43,096
我什么时候弄的?
When did I do that?

263
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,013
我为什么要抓伤你?
Why did I scratch you?

264
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,080
怎么了?
What's going on?

265
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:26,024
呃...我去洛杉矶的飞机几小时后就要起飞了
Uh...My flight. L, uh...My flight to LA leaves in a couple of hours,

266
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:30,013
所以现在得走了 你知道么? 呃...
so you gotta get moving, you know? Uh...

267
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:35,000
你路上要再带一包海洛因么?
You wanna do one more bump for the road?

268
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:39,081
我们昨晚都吸完了  我有几瓶香槟
We did it all last night. I got some champagne.

269
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:42,052
你一定还留着几包
You gotta have some left.

270
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,006
不  全没了
Nope. It's done.

271
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,054
我下次来悉尼我会再来找你的  好么?
I'll look you up next time I'm in Sydney, okay.

272
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:53,017
我会  送你一张我亲笔签名的CD
I'll, uh, send you an autographed copy of, uh, my CD,

273
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,061
然后你就能随时随刻听我的歌了
then you can listen when you want.

274
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:57,093
我不想要你那什么混蛋乐队的烂CD
I don't want your crap CD from your crap band.

275
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,075
昨晚在酒吧里你说你是我们的歌迷
Last night in the bar, you said you were a fan.

276
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:03,073
好吧  我是一个狂热的歌迷
Fine. I'm a huge fan.

277
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:06,008
驱动器乐队是最好的混蛋乐队
Drive Thru is the best damn band ever.

278
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,016
现在  给我一包海洛因  我知道你有
Now just gimme a bump, 'cause I know you got some.

279
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:11,057
主动轴
Shaft.

280
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,055
是主动轴乐队
Drive Shaft.

281
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,089
你手里的是什么?
What's that in your hand?

282
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,054
没什么
Nothing.

283
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:24,013
-你瞒着我?  -我瞒着你?  不  没有
-Holding out on me?  -I'm not holding out.

284
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:25,003
给我
Give it to me.

285
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,021
给你什么? 我什么都没拿
What? I'm not holding.

286
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:28,063
快给我
Get off!

287
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,070
起来
Get up!

288
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:31,051
起来
Get up!

289
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:34,043
松手  松手
Let it go. Let it go!

290
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:36,018
-你怎么了  疯了么?  -松手
-What are you, crazy?  -Let it go!

291
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:38,031
-下去  -松手
-Get off!  -Let it go!

292
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:39,046
滚开
Get off!

293
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,050
-从我身上滚开  
-Get off me!

294
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:51,078
你这个可怜虫
You're pathetic.

295
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:54,078
你这个可怜虫
You're pathetic!

296
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,060
Sayid  Sayid

297
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:11,090
Rousseau在海滩那儿  她要见你
Rousseau's on the beach. She needs you.

298
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,014
-Rousseau? 怎么了?  -我不知道
-Rousseau? What for?  -I don't know.

299
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,014
救命  救命  来人啊
Help! Help!

300
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,065
救命  来人啊  救命
Help! Someone! Help!

301
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:21,095
怎么了?
What happened?

302
00:24:22,064 --> 00:24:23,046
她的头
Her head.

303
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,006
他还好么?
Is he all right?

304
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,055
她抢走了我的孩子?
Did she take my baby?

305
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,097
她抢走了我的孩子是么?
Did she take my baby?

306
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,011
她往哪儿去了?
Which way did she go?

307
00:24:33,062 --> 00:24:34,086
我不知道
I don't know!

308
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,069
她抢走了我的孩子
She took my baby!

309
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:40,003
全怪你  是你把他带到我们营地来的
This is your fault! You brought her into the camp!

310
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:41,048
当初如果你给我一把抢的话...
If you had given me a gun...

311
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:44,029
不准再打我了
Do not hit me again.

312
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,098
你是想浪费时间来抱怨么
You want to waste time assigning blame?

313
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,085
这些时间足够让我们去找她了
There's plenty to go around.

314
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,048
她先走了  如果我们现在就去  还能赶上她
She has a head start. If we leave now, we can catch her.

315
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:53,080
我们怎么能追上她?
How we gonna do that?

316
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,080
因为我知道她往哪儿去了
Because I know where she's going.

317
00:24:57,065 --> 00:25:00,008
不  不要...我要找回我的孩子
Please now... I want my baby.

318
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:10,048
你可以把炸药全部放我包里
I can carry all the sticks in my pack.

319
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,045
中间隔离的东西越多越好
The more insulation we stuff in, the better.

320
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,053
我想我们应该分开来拿
I think we should split 'em up.

321
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,038
什么?
What?

322
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:22,003
把它们放一起是很不明智的  我们还是分开带吧
It's not smart to keep it all together, so we split 'em up.

323
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:25,039
如果我们要3根来炸开舱门盖的话  我们就要带上6根炸药
If we need three sticks to blow the hinge, then we should bring six.

324
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,065
三个三个分开拿
Three and three.

325
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:29,063
以防万一我们其中一人...
A fail-safe. In case one of us...

326
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,076
那就你和我吧
You and me then.

327
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,003
不  我要带一包
No. I'm taking one.

328
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,083
这不可能  不行
Not gonna happen.

329
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:40,088
-我来这儿就是为了这个  -那么你就是白来了
-This is why I came.  -You wasted a trip.

330
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:42,059
我必须要这么做
I need to do this.

331
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:44,083
Kate  没人欠别人什么
Kate, no one owes anyone anything.

332
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,030
-我要带一包  -没得说了
-I'm carrying one.  -We're done.

333
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:48,029
-这不是由你来定的  -Kate 这就是由我来定的
-This is not your decision.  -It is.

334
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:49,073
我们抽签吧
We'll draw straws.

335
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,025
他们就要来了
They're coming...

336
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:55,030
我们没时间来决定由谁来冒这个险了  那么...
We don't have time to argue about who risks their life, so.

337
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:57,063
我们就让命运来决定吧
we let fate decide.

338
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,090
我同意
Works for me.

339
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:05,053
你呢?  也想带点炸药么?
What about you? You wanna carry some dynamite?

340
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,041
你的身上...
You got some...

341
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,008
Arnzt的...
Arnzt on you.

342
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:22,016
谁抽到短的就由谁来背炸药
Short sticks carry the packs.

343
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,041
就是你和我了  Kate
Looks like it's you and me, Kate.

344
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:50,095
这东西是用来干嘛的?
So, what's this stuff even do?

345
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,073
这个是发报机  向别人发送求救信号的
Well, the transmitter sends out an SOS in case someone's listening.

346
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,092
并且在这片海域里有什么动静的话
And if there's anything out there,

347
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,057
我们都可以在这个雷达屏幕里看到
we'll see it on this radar screen here.

348
00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:07,003
开始吧
Here we go.

349
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,036
拜托
Come on.

350
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,014
来人救我们
Someone, find us.

351
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:24,027
这些都是大家写的信息
Those are messages everybody wrote.

352
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:25,077
当然是
Sure are.

353
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,026
他们是隐私的东西
They're private.

354
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:29,014
是的
Yep.

355
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:35,056
我从来没注意到Tracy是这么想念她在弗雷斯诺的丈夫和孩子们
I for one never knew how much Tracey missed her hubby and two kids back in Fresno.

356
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,033
但是她晚上还是睡在Scott身边取暖
Yet she's sleeping next to good ol' Scott to keep her warm at night.

357
00:27:40,064 --> 00:27:42,075
那是Steve Scott死了
That's Steve. Scott's dead.

358
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:47,049
随便了  这旅途会很漫长  我们得找东西来开心开心
Whatever. Long ride, Kazoo. We gotta keep ourselves entertained.

359
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:53,031
Hugo究竟是谁  他怎么会留给他妈妈1亿6千万美元?
Who the hell is Hugo and how's he got a hundred and sixty million dollars to leave to his mom?

360
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:55,034
如果我读你的你会怎么想?
How'd you like it if I read yours?

361
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:58,004
你读不到我的  因为我没写过
You can't 'cause I didn't write one.

362
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,023
为什么不写?
Why not?

363
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:03,074
因为我唯一写过的一封信是给我要去杀的那个人的
'Cause the only letter I ever wrote is to the man I'm gonna kill.

364
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:05,086
你为什么要杀他?
Why you gonna kill him?

365
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:07,068
因为我必须这么做
'Cause I need to.

366
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:10,015
就是因为
Because.

367
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:20,048
你在开什么玩笑?
Are you bloody joking?

368
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,019
她为什么会去黑烟那儿?
Why would she go for the black smoke?

369
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,087
那儿不就是"其他人"应该在的地方么?
Isn't that where the others are?

370
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:26,010
她去那儿就是为了找那些人
The others are why she would go there.

371
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:30,086
Rousseau告诉我们16年前她的孩子被抢了的当天她就看到了黑烟
Rousseau told us she saw black smoke the day her own child was taken 16 years ago.

372
00:28:31,097 --> 00:28:33,063
他们抢走了她的孩子
They took something from her.

373
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:35,025
现在她相信
And now she believes...

374
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:37,089
她有他们想要的东西
she has something they want.

375
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:40,008
她准备拿孩子做交换?
She's making a trade?

376
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:41,057
我相信她是这么想的
I believe she is. Yes.

377
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:43,086
太疯狂了  她脑子有病
That's insane. She's insane.

378
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:46,004
别指责她的所做所为
Don't apply reason to her actions.

379
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:49,026
她是一个失去孩子的母亲...就像Claire一样
She's a mother who lost her child. Just like Claire.

380
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:53,090
这次去不是为了报仇
This isn't about revenge.

381
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:56,018
别太自私
Don't make it personal.

382
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:03,036
我也要去
I'm coming with you.

383
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:04,074
这不行  Claire
That's not a good idea.

384
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:07,097
那是我的孩子  好么?  是我让她抢走的
This is my baby, okay. I let her take him.

385
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,052
-Claire 听着...  -别告诉我我该怎么做 可以么?
-Claire, listen.  -Don't tell me what to do!

386
00:29:10,056 --> 00:29:11,011
冷静点
Calm down.

387
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,046
我也要和你们一起去
I am coming with you.

388
00:29:12,056 --> 00:29:16,026
这全怪我 我要去 好么? 你阻止不了我的
This is my fault and I'm coming and you can't stop me!

389
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:19,099
-好了好了  -我也要去
-It's fine, all right. It's all right.  -I'm supposed to raise him.

390
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,067
把他带回来  Charlie
Get him back, Charlie.

391
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:33,028
把Aaron带回来
Get Aaron back.

392
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,018
Aaron?

393
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:40,007
求你把他带回来  求你了
Please. Get him back. Please.

394
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:44,014
Claire  我会把他带回来的  我保证
Claire, I will get him back. Promise.

395
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,053
你想吃点什么么?
Hey, you want something to eat?

396
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:12,010
我想你是不要了
I guess that's a "no" then.

397
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:24,076
如果你是在为Vincent担心  它会没事的  伙计
If you're worried about Vincent, he's gonna be okay, man.

398
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:27,036
狗坐飞机都是要进行李舱的
Dogs fly in the luggage compartment all the time.

399
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,064
好吧
All right.

400
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,063
我去打个电话
I gotta call work.

401
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,050
呆在这儿
Right over there.

402
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,038
哪儿都别去  好么?
Don't go anywhere, okay?

403
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,034
不  我住在小公寓住宅里
No, I live in a studio apartment.

404
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:53,095
我得在早上5点钟之前赶去工作
I gotta be out the door in the morning for work by 5am.

405
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:55,062
谁来照看他?
Who's gonna watch him?

406
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,077
他怎么去学校? 他放学后怎么办?
How's he getting to school? What about after?

407
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:59,032
我不能这么做  妈
I can't do this, Ma.

408
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:03,019
你知道  我...
You know, I was...

409
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:06,054
听着  我在想
Listen, I was thinking, um...

410
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,053
我在想也许你能照看一下他
I was thinking maybe you could take him.

411
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:15,061
妈  如果这是钱的问题的话 我...
But Ma, if it's a question of money, I...

412
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,090
然么我该拿他怎么办?
What am I supposed to do with him?

413
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:25,066
他不应该是我的
He's not supposed to be mine.

414
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:27,080
这可不是当初就想好的
This was never part of the plan.

415
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:35,050
好吧  我...
Yeah, I...

416
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:53,087
伙计
Hey, man.

417
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,099
-我在  呃...  -我要新电池
-I was, uh...  -I need new batteries.

418
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:07,023
要试一下么?
You wanna try?

419
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,056
-什么?  -来吧 过来
-What?  -Come on, come here.

420
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:11,032
你来试着驾驶一会儿
You drive for awhile.

421
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:12,098
-真的么?  -是啊
-Really?  -Absolutely.

422
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,092
好的  听着  舵是船最重要的部分
Okay, now. Look.The most important part of this boat is the rudder.

423
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,002
我告诉你怎么掌舵
It's how you steer.

424
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:21,002
慢慢地转动  别太用力  好么?
You turn it gradually. Nothing sharp, okay?

425
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:22,047
往这儿推
Push it this way.

426
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,050
我们往哪儿走?
Where are we going?

427
00:32:28,086 --> 00:32:29,062
看
Look.

428
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,066
我们大约是往北方或东北方向移动
So we're going approximately north by northeast.

429
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:36,012
这样我们就会有希望驶上海洋航线...
So hopefully that puts us into a shipping lane.

430
00:32:36,098 --> 00:32:38,042
或是看到陆地之类的
Or we hit some land.

431
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:41,002
我该怎么找准方向?
What do I aim for?

432
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:44,088
看到地平线那儿的云了么?
See that cloud on the horizon?

433
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,057
恩
Yeah.

434
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,031
你就朝那儿走吧
You aim for that.

435
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:51,030
-好的  -我知道了
-Okay.  -Got it.

436
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,013
为什么你和我妈妈不住在一起呢?
How come you and my mom didn't stay together?

437
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,012
我们尝试过了
We tried.

438
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,006
但没有用  我们的生活  我们的爱好...
It just didn't work out. So our lives, our interests

439
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,065
完全是不同路的
just went in different directions.

440
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,015
那为什么我从没见到过你?
How come I never saw you?

441
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:20,053
因为你妈妈不想让我见你
'Cause your mom didn't want me to.

442
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:24,044
她认为她做的一切都是为你好
She did what she thought was best.

443
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:28,035
她错了
She was wrong.

444
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:35,049
舵
Rudder.

445
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,053
舵掉了
We lost the rudder.

446
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:38,081
舵  舵
Rudder. Rudder.

447
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:40,036
它沉下去了  我们会丢了舵
We're losing it! It's sinking!

448
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,048
把船停下
Stop the boat.

449
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:43,024
把船停下
Stop the boat!

450
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:45,005
把帆收起来
Just pull the sail down.

451
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,057
爸爸
Dad!

452
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:53,047
Sawyer

453
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:00,049
Sawyer  把绳子给我
Sawyer! Give me the rope. Throw it.

454
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:15,054
-Sawyer  -它在下沉
-Sawyer!  -It's sinking.

455
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:22,013
我够不到
I can't reach it.

456
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:36,003
把它拴在舵板上  我们会把你拉回来的
Tie it around the rudder and we'll pull you in!

457
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:43,017
好的
Okay.

458
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,037
Michael.

459
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,040
加油  伙计
Come on, buddy.

460
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:07,048
你救了我们的命  伙计
You just saved our ass, buddy.

461
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:21,079
这是你的衬衣  在你被晒伤前你最好穿上
Here's your shirt. You should put that back on before you burn.

462
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:39,001
-抱歉  -恩 没事...
-Sorry.  -Yeah, well...

463
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,085
中签很幸运
It's the luck of the draw.

464
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,024
太阳大约90分钟后下山
Sun sets in 90 minutes, give or take.

465
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,083
我们要回舱门那儿就得快点动身了
If we want to get back to the hatch, we have to hustle.

466
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,003
好的  我们这么做
Okay, this is how we do this.

467
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,063
我带路  Kate  你跟着我
I'll lead. Kate, you're right behind me.

468
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:55,042
然后是Hurley  John  你最后
Then Hurley. John, you bring up the rear.

469
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:57,008
如果你看见我走错路了...
If you see me heading the wrong way...

470
00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:58,089
我们应该错开队形
We should stagger our formation.

471
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:01,000
相互之间保持一定的安全距离
Keep a safe distance from each other.

472
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:03,067
好的  我们错开走
All right. We stagger.

473
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:06,080
如果有人听见什么或是看到什么...
If anyone hears anything or sees anything...

474
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:09,036
像是吃人的安全系统之类的?
Like the security system that eats people?

475
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,096
就像那个
Yeah. Like that.

476
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:16,007
你们两个卸下背包放到地上马上跑  懂了么?
You two, you take your packs off, you put 'em down and you run. You got it?

477
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:17,098
-知道了  -是的 长官
-Got it.  -Yes, sir.

478
00:36:20,086 --> 00:36:33,005
好的  我们走吧
Okay. Let's do this.

479
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,043
他死得很勇敢
He died bravely.

480
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,042
什么?
What?

481
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:22,080
你的哥哥
Your brother.

482
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:25,064
是的
Yeah.

483
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:28,066
谢谢
Thanks.

484
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:36,008
你认为这些事...
Do you think all this...

485
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:39,068
我们所经历的这些...
...all we've been through...?

486
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:44,037
你认为是我们所受的惩罚么?
Do you think we're being punished?

487
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,092
对于什么的惩罚?
Punished for what?

488
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:52,033
我们以前的所做所为
Things we did before.

489
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:56,050
我们隐瞒的秘密
The secrets we kept.

490
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,081
我们说的谎言
The lies we told.

491
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,026
你认为是谁在惩罚我们?
Who do you think is punishing us?

492
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,000
命运
Fate.

493
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,024
没人在惩罚我们
No one's punishing us.

494
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,054
这世上没有命运这回事
No such thing as fate.

495
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:35,080
-你还好吧?  -我没事 继续走吧
-Are you okay?  -I'm fine. Keep going.

496
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:47,017
天色暗下来了
We're losing the light.

497
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:48,080
-尽量跟上  -我来了
-Try to keep up.  -I'm coming.

498
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,033
Sayid

499
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:20,052
在这儿
Over here.

500
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,023
Sayid?

501
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,087
你太累了  我们休息一下
You can barely breathe. We're going to rest.

502
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:29,078
休息?  她现在就在那儿...
Rest? She's out there right now.

503
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:31,064
还差很远  你会受不了的
In another mile, you're going to collapse.

504
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:33,046
我们得休息一下
We're going to take a break.

505
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:41,046
Boone就是在这儿摔下来的么?
Is this where Boone fell?

506
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,016
这架飞机本来是在上面的
The plane was up there.

507
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:47,022
它是从哪儿来的?
Where did it come from?

508
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:49,074
根据里面的地图来看  是从尼日利亚来的
Based on the maps inside, Nigeria.

509
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:54,004
上面有人么?
Anyone onboard?

510
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:56,099
两个穿的像牧师的人
Two men, dressed as priests.

511
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:59,062
-牧师?  -伪装成牧师的毒贩
-Priests?  -Drug runners in disguise.

512
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:03,073
满飞机都是海洛因
The plane was loaded with heroin.

513
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:13,036
知道了...
All right.

514
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:17,081
我们该走了
Now we go.

515
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:18,078
伙计  你认为在那个舱门里面的是什么?
So, dude, what do you think's inside that hatch thing?

516
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:21,075
你认为那里面有什么?
What do you think's inside it?

517
00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:27,011
像是一堆50年代的冷冻快餐什么的
Stacks of TV dinners from the fifties or something.

518
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:36,078
还有连着电缆的电视 手机 干净的袜子 香皂 还有类似三明治的东西
And TVs with cable. Some cell phones. Clean socks. Soap. Twinkies.

519
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:40,017
你知道  就当作是餐后的甜点吧
You know, for dessert after the TV dinners.

520
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:42,084
那种三明治可以保存8000年左右  伙计
Twinkies keep for, like, 8,000 years, man.

521
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:47,010
我也很喜欢那种三明治似的东西
I like Twinkies too.

522
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,060
好了  说真的  你认为里面有什么?
Come on, really. What do you think's inside?

523
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:54,015
希望
Hope.

524
00:41:55,053 --> 00:41:57,013
我认为里面有我们的希望
I think hope's inside.

525
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:37,034
不管是谁  把这儿叫做"黑暗地域"的人...都是天才
Whoever named this place Dark Territory,genius.

526
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:03,063
是的  我看见了
Yeah. I saw it.

527
00:43:05,022 --> 00:43:06,040
我们得快点离开这儿
We gotta get out of here.

528
00:43:33,075 --> 00:43:35,012
Locke  你在干什么?
Locke! What are you doing?

529
00:43:54,027 --> 00:43:55,005
Locke

530
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:06,053
Locke

531
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:19,092
Locke  Locke

532
00:44:23,064 --> 00:44:24,027
Jack?

533
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:27,051
Jack

534
00:44:57,023 --> 00:44:58,072
我的天那  Locke
Oh, my God. Locke!

535
00:44:58,087 --> 00:45:00,005
我需要炸弹
I need the dynamite!

536
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:02,082
不  它们在我的包里
No, no. It's in my pack.

537

-我会没事的   -不
-I'll be all right.  -No!

541
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:15,063
放手吧  我不会有事的
-Let me go! I'll be all right.

542
00:45:15,073 --> 00:45:17,010
好了  我拿到了
I got it! I got it!

543
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:19,058
小心打开
Be careful unwrapping it.

544
00:45:21,074 --> 00:45:23,081
-扔下去  -不  会把我们炸飞的
-Now throw it in.  -No! Lt'll blow us up.

545
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:25,095
-快扔下去 快  -别这么做  Kate
-Do it! Hurry! I can't hold him.  -Don't do this.

546
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:27,062
扔下去
Throw it in.

547
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,086
快  Kate
Now, Kate!

548
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,021

00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:23,091
是你的妻子帮你做的么?

550
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:25,072
Sun

551
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:29,013
她把它们的发音写出来了  恩?  这样你就能学英语了
She sounded it out, huh? So you can learn English.

552
00:46:31,075 --> 00:46:33,040
我希望她也帮我做一份
Yeah, I wish she made one for me.

553
00:46:35,037 --> 00:46:36,074
那么  这儿有些什么单词?
So, what words are in here?

554
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:40,057
英语单词  你会说哪些?

I need to know why you believe that thing wasn't gonna...

692
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,024
我相信我正在被考验
I believe that I was being tested.

693
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,089
-考验?  -是的 考验
-Tested.  -Yeah. Tested.

694
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,084
我想这就是为什么我们有时不能互相了解的原因 Jack
I think that's why you and I don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

695
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:56,073
因为你是一个相信科学的人
Because you're a man of science.

696
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:59,073
是的  那你呢?
Yeah. And what does that make you?

697
00:57:59,096 --> 00:58:02,081
我?  我是一个相信命运的人
Me? Well, I'm a man of faith.

698
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:08,098
你真的以为这些都是一场事故么?
Do you really think all this is an accident?

699
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:12,070
我们  一帮陌生人  幸存了下来
That we, a group of strangers, survived.

700
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:15,005
其中很多人都只是受了很浅的一点伤
Many of us with just superficial injuries.

701
00:58:15,053 --> 00:58:18,040
你以为我们是凑巧坠落到这个地方的么?
You think we crashed on this place by coincidence?

702
00:58:18,047 --> 00:58:19,090
尤其是这个地方?
Especially this place.

703
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:24,027
我们被带到这儿来是有目的有原因的  我们大家都是
We were brought here for a purpose. For a reason. All of us.

704
00:58:24,072 --> 00:58:28,037
我们每个人被带到这儿来都是有原因的
Each one of us was brought here for a reason.

705
00:58:29,016 --> 00:58:30,003
被带来这里
Brought here?

706
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:33,035
是谁把我们带来这里的  John?
And who brought us here, John?

707
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:37,086
是这个岛把我们带到这儿来的
The island brought us here.

708
00:58:39,075 --> 00:58:42,069
这不是一个寻常的地方  你也看见了  我知道你看见了
This is no ordinary place. You've seen that, I know you have.

709
00:58:44,035 --> 00:58:46,028
这个岛也选择了你  Jack
The island chose you too, Jack.

710
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,095
这就是命运
It's destiny.

711
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:54,017
你和Boone也谈过命运了么  John?
Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John?

712
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:02,039
Boone是这个岛所要求的牺牲品
Boone was a sacrifice that the island demanded.

713
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,037
他在那架飞机里所发生的一切
What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events

714
00:59:10,081 --> 00:59:12,097
是把我们带到这儿来的一系列事件中的一件
that led us here,

715
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:14,034
这些事让我们走到了同一条路上
that led us down a path,

716
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:18,040
它们带我们到了今天  到了现在
that led you and me to this day, to right now.

717
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,056
这条路什么时候是个尽头  John?
And where's that path end, John?

718
00:59:23,074 --> 00:59:25,055
尽头就在舱门那儿
The path ends at the hatch.

719
00:59:27,006 --> 00:59:28,039
那个舱门  Jack
The hatch, Jack.

720
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,077
全部  发生的全部的事都是为了让我们能够打开舱门
All of it. All of it happened so we can open the hatch.

721
00:59:30,082 --> 00:59:34,049
不  不  我们打开舱门是为了能幸存下来
No. No, we're opening the hatch so that we can survive.

722
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,063
幸存也是很有关系的  Jack
Survival is all relative, Jack.

723
00:59:45,046 --> 00:59:47,015
我不相信命运
I don't believe in destiny.

724
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,009
不  你相信的
Yes, you do.

725
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:54,098
你只是还不了解罢了
You just don't know it yet.

726
01:00:17,095 --> 01:00:19,061
我刚刚才打开过的
I turned it on a little while ago.

727
01:00:19,085 --> 01:00:21,024
Sayid说过每小时打开一次
Sayid said every hour.

728
01:00:21,098 --> 01:00:25,092
听着  我们已经离岛15英里远了  我们可能会在这儿呆上好几个星期
Look, we're 15 miles out. We could be here for weeks.

729
01:00:26,017 --> 01:00:28,097
-如果电池用完了...  -他说了 每个小时
-If that battery runs out...  -The man said every hour.

730
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,095
5分钟  不能再长了
Five minutes. No more.

731
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,063
好  好
Aye, aye.

732
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:43,075
知道我喜欢你的哪一点么  Mike?
Know what I like about you, Mike?

733
01:00:45,024 --> 01:00:46,082
你有圣人才有的耐心
You got the patience of a saint.

734
01:00:47,004 --> 01:00:48,096
是么?  为什么你这么说?
Yeah? Why you say that?

735
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:51,076
我看到了他对你说话的方式
I've seen the way he talks to you.

736
01:00:52,073 --> 01:00:55,033
他跑来跑去  做他愿做的事
The way he runs around, does whatever the hell he wants.

737
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:59,028
如果是我我早就会狠狠打他一顿了
I'd have shown him the back of my hand a long time ago.

738
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:01,054
你会的  是么?
You would, huh?

739
01:01:02,022 --> 01:01:03,093
是的  你说对了
Hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.

740
01:01:05,022 --> 01:01:08,091
那是你父亲对待你的方式么?  狠狠打你一顿?
Is that what your father did to you? Show you the back of his hand?

741
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:11,031
我的爸爸没机会打我
My daddy never got a chance to beat me.

742
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:14,014
在我8岁的时候他开枪自杀了
Shot himself when I was eight.

743
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,012
这就是为什么你这么想死了?
That why you wanna die?

744
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,016
什么?
What?

745
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:25,099
自从你说你想上救生艇开始  我就想不通了
Since you told me you wanted on this raft, I couldn't figure it out.

746
01:01:26,074 --> 01:01:31,052
为什么一个只知道关心自己的人会冒着生命危险去救其它人?
Why's a guy who only cares about himself wanna risk his life to save everyone else?

747
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:35,098
就我所知道的  这只有两个可能
Way I see it, there's only two choices.

748
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:38,067
你如果不是想成为一个英雄
You're either a hero,

749
01:01:39,027 --> 01:01:40,050
就是想死了
or you wanna die.

750
01:01:47,046 --> 01:01:48,097
我不是英雄  Mike
Well...I ain't no hero, Mike.

751
01:01:59,077 --> 01:02:01,029
这代表了什么?
That what I think it is?

752
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,058
有东西在那边
Something's out there.

753
01:02:28,096 --> 01:02:33,037
不好意思  先生  我们为残疾乘客特制的轮椅...
I'm sorry, sir, but the special wheelchair that we use for loading disabled passengers,

754
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,063
我们一下子找不到了
no one seems to know where it is right now,

755
01:02:35,072 --> 01:02:38,050
在我们找到那张轮椅之前  我们无法让你登机
and unless we find it, I'm not sure we can get you on.

756
01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:41,000
明天之前已经没有班次了
There's not another flight till tomorrow.

757
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:43,037
是的  我知道  先生  但是我真的没办法
I'm aware, but there's nothing I can do.

758
01:02:43,046 --> 01:02:45,019
我能带着 Michelle  我们可以把他抬上去
Look, I can get Michelle. We can carry him on.

759
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,005
你不介意我们把你抬上去吧?
Mind if we carry you on?

760
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,053
不  那样很好
No, that would be fine.

761
01:03:01,002 --> 01:03:02,019
就是这儿了
Here we go.

762
01:03:03,022 --> 01:03:04,059
这儿是你的座位
Here's your seat.

763
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:10,058
我把你的包拿来  先生
I'll get your bags, sir.

764
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,035
如果有什么需要的  只要按这个钮就行了
If you need anything, press the "call" button.

765
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:14,007
好的
Okay.

766
01:04:18,005 --> 01:04:21,030
把这些多余的炸药带远一点
Hugo, take these extra sticks back a couple hundred yards.

767
01:04:24,062 --> 01:04:25,087
好的
Oh, okay.

768
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:27,030
知道了
Got it.

769
01:04:29,025 --> 01:04:30,003
小心点
Be careful.

770
01:04:33,095 --> 01:04:35,001
给我一个手电筒好么?
Can I have a flashlight?

771
01:04:36,024 --> 01:04:38,034
因为  火把围着一根炸药
'Cause, uh, the torch around the dynamite thing,

772
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:40,002
对我来说太离奇了
 not making sense to me.

773
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:46,003
Kate  你来牵导火索
Kate, you run the fuse.

774
01:04:48,038 --> 01:04:49,098
Jack和我来装炸药
Jack and I will rig the charges.

775
01:04:50,017 --> 01:04:51,022
好的
Okay.

776
01:05:29,036 --> 01:05:30,049
那到底是什么?
What the hell is that?

777
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:35,009
看不见有脚印  没有什么痕迹
There's no footprints, no tracks.

778
01:05:36,035 --> 01:05:38,098
就这些了? 这就是黑烟?
This is it? This is the black smoke?

779
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:41,074
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?

780
01:05:42,077 --> 01:05:43,074
我不知道
I don't know.

781
01:05:55,058 --> 01:05:56,054
Danielle?

782
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,043
马上
Right now!

783
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:02,053
冷静点
Calm down.

784
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:07,014
Danielle

785
01:06:08,024 --> 01:06:09,064
我听到你在那儿了  出来吧
I can hear you. Come out.

786
01:06:10,084 --> 01:06:12,083
求你了  他需要回到他母亲那儿
Please. He needs his mother.

787
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:25,005
他们不在这儿
They were not here.

788
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:28,036
Danielle  你得把孩子给我们
Danielle, you have to give us the baby.

789
01:06:30,094 --> 01:06:31,095
我只是...
I just

790
01:06:32,077 --> 01:06:34,079
想要回我的Alex
wanted my Alex back.

791
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,083
我以为...
I thought

792
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:40,095
如果我把这孩子交给他们...
if I gave them the baby...

793
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,087
好了
It's okay.

794
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,089
我知道
I know.

795
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:09,062
没事了
It's okay.

796
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:22,082
我拿稳了
I got him.

797
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:29,069
从来就没有什么"其他人"
There never were any others.

798
01:07:30,024 --> 01:07:32,000
火是你自己点起来的
You started the fires yourself!

799
01:07:33,009 --> 01:07:36,038
不  我听见他们的耳语声了
No. I heard them whispering.

800
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:37,052
你傻掉了
You're a nut job.

801
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:38,097
你根本什么也没听见
You heard nothing.

802
01:07:39,075 --> 01:07:42,074
我听见他们说他们会来抢走孩子
I heard them say they were coming for the child.

803
01:07:44,008 --> 01:07:47,042
"其他人"说他们会来抢走这男孩的
The others said they were coming for the boy.

804
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,042
你这个可怜虫
You're pathetic.

805
01:08:18,073 --> 01:08:19,048
线
Wire.

806
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:30,004
抓住另一头
Hold that end.

807
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,078
现在是导火索了
Now the fuse.

808
01:08:58,083 --> 01:08:59,069
我来吧
I'll do it.

809
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:36,048
-只能弄这么远了  -够远了
-That's as far as it goes.  -It's far enough.

810
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:38,052
我来点
I'll light it.

811
01:09:38,099 --> 01:09:41,073
你们找个掩体躲好  我有足够的时间可以逃走
You take cover. There'll be enough burn time for me to get clear.

812
01:09:45,026 --> 01:09:46,036
等一下
Wait. Just a sec.

813
01:09:56,003 --> 01:09:57,069
那么刚才在那儿是怎么回事?
What was that about back there?

814
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,071
什么怎么回事?
What was what about?

815
01:10:01,088 --> 01:10:03,072
把炸药放在你的包里
Putting the dynamite in your pack.

816
01:10:05,025 --> 01:10:06,045
我做了一个判断与抉择
I made a judgment call.

817
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:08,038
我们是抽签的
We drew straws.

818
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:12,001
抱歉 但是我不会让像那样抽签来替我们做抉择的 Kate
I'm not gonna let drawing straws make decisions like that.

819
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:13,005
你没有权利这样
You had no right.

820
01:10:13,013 --> 01:10:16,006
每个人都想让我来当领导者  直到我做出了他们不喜欢的决定
Everybody wants me to be a leader till I make a decision they don't like.

821
01:10:16,054 --> 01:10:18,022
你想就这样一直在事后才来劝告我么  Kate?
You want to keep second guessing me?

822
01:10:18,037 --> 01:10:19,063
那就是你的事了
That's your call.

823
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:22,007
你要知道一点
There's something you need to know.

824
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:26,023
如果我们这次活下来了  我们今晚就活下来了...
If we survive this, if we survive tonight...

825
01:10:28,087 --> 01:10:30,060
我们还会有Locke的问题要解决
we're gonna have a Locke problem.

826
01:10:36,008 --> 01:10:38,005
现在我想知道你是支持我的
And I have to know that you've got my back.

827
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:42,009
我支持你

We don't know if Sayid's radar works.

We survived, and there's a whole group of people on the island.

The boy. We're gonna have to take him.

882

Hey, what the hell's going on here?

883
