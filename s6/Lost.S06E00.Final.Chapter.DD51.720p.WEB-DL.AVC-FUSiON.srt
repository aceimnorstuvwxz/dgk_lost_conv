我会治好你的

81
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:21,028
他被工作压得喘不过气

我用了所有办法  我就要成功了

他要向他的父亲Christian证明自己

86
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:31,032
你在胡说些什么
What are you talking about?

87
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,056
我是说如果你把液囊缝上

但是Jack从未得到机会

90
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:40,073
因为它的父亲在悉尼去世了

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
就是他
that's him.

92
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:45,077
Jack要把他的遗体运送回国
And it was up to Jack to bring the body home.

96
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:54,092
就会孤独地死去
we're gonna die alone.

是我在照顾你  妈妈

108
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,065

113
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,098
这不重要  Kate

114

还有Sawyer  魅力十足的流氓

120
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:52,076
你跟医生说过咱俩的事了吗

121
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,086
没有  但他知道

122
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,063
既然那已经不是问题
Well, now if that's out of the way,

123
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,080
我们何不午后逍遥一下
how about a little afternoon delight?

124
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:01,064
雀斑女  等等
Freckles, wait!

125
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,070
想让我给你灌一张混合唱片吗

好啊  为什么不试试

127

听妈妈说

128
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,028
当James Ford还是个小男孩的时候
James Ford was just a young boy

129
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:13,075

when his father was swindled by a man named Sawyer.

130
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,046
躲到床底下  别出声
Get under the bed. Don't make a sound.

131
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:16,045
把门打开

00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:18,099
James的父亲盛怒之下杀了自己的妻子
James' father went into a rage and killed his wife...

133
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:21,099

Stop it! What are you doing?! What the hell are you...

134
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:24,082
然后他自杀了
just before he killed himself.

135
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,016
James长大后成了一个骗子
James grew up to become a con man,

136
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:30,033
他用的正是那个骗子的名字

137
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,030
为了报仇  他来到了澳大利亚
and his need for vengeance brought him to Australia,

138
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:37,013
他以为自己找到了那个他要找的人
where he believed he'd found the man he sought.

139
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,084
Sawyer

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,054
但他错了
But he was wrong.

141
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,074
你不知道自己在做什么  对吗
You don't know what you're doin', do you?

142

在岛上  Sawyer经常和Jack发生争执
On the island, Sawyer often clashed with Jack.

143
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,054
你没有认清局势  医生
You're just not looking at the big picture, doc.

144
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:50,018
你还在活在文明世界里
You're still back in civilization.

145
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,011
那你在哪
And where are you?

146
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,022
我在荒岛上
I'm in the wild.

147
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:55,025
他总是惹是生非
And he had trouble getting along.

148
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:57,059
别打了
Break it up!

149
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,065
住手  我们发现了一个无线电收发机
Stop! We found a transceiver

150
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,036
但它坏了
but it's not working.

151
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:02,072
有人能帮上忙吗  是的
Can anybody help? Yes.

152
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,036
不要相信这个家伙
Let's trust this guy!

153
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,063
我们现在是一根绳上的蚂蚱  哥们
We're all in this together, man.

154
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,001
我们应该尊重彼此  平等相待
Let's treat each other with a little respect.

155
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,033
闭嘴  猪头
Shut up, lard-o.

156
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
老烟鬼
Chain-smokin' jackass.

157
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:12,003
有些人就是那副德性
Some people have problems.

158
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,069
你怎么知道如何修那个东西
How do you know how to do all that?

159
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:15,050
我以前做过部队的通讯官
I was a military communications officer.

160
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:18,000
哪个部队的  空军  陆军
What were you, air force? Army?

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,031
共和国卫队
The republican guard.

162
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,097
是  长官
Yes, sir.

163
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:22,091
815航班坠毁以前
Before the 815 crashed,

164
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:25,078
Sayid是一名伊拉克的拷问官
Sayid was a torturer in Iraq.

165
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,071
有一套新设备可以供你使用
I guess you have a new skill set you can use.

166
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,065
但他背叛了军队
But he was conflicted,

167
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:33,039
他爱上了一个由他拷问的女人
and he fell in love with a woman he tortured.

168
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:34,094
这不是一场游戏  Nadia
This isn't a game, Nadia.

169
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,076
但你一直不愿退出  Sayid
And yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

170
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:38,056
守卫
Guard!

171
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:41,053
Sayid冒着生命危险让Nadia得到自由
Sayid risked his life to give Nadia her freedom...

172
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:43,099
拿着
Take it.

173
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:46,040
接着他开始全力寻找Nadia
Then spent his life searching for her.

174
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:48,093
我们知道她在哪
We know where she is.

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,080
他和中情局合作捣毁一场恐怖活动后
When he cooperated with the CIA to overthrow a terrorist plot,

176
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:55,004
以为自己终于可以回到Nadia身边
he thought he'd finally found a way back to Nadia.

177
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,078
但是大洋815号在岛上坠毁
But Oceanic 815 crashed on the island...

178
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,078
有人看到了吗
Did anybody see that?

179
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:04,008
他们面临着小岛给出的重重挑战
And that presented its own set of challenges...

180
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:06,031
好极了
Terrific.

181
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:08,072
因为这不是一个普通的岛
For this was not an ordinary island...

182
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,026
Jack
Jack!

183
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,096
这可不是想入非非
Not by any stretch of the imagination.

184
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:25,043
爸爸
Dad?

185
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,047
这群人远离家乡
And this group was a very long way from home.

186
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:32,020
我们收到一格信号了
Hey! We've got a bar!

187
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:35,024
是法语  搜救队  肯定是的
That's French! The rescue party... it has to be.

188
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,091
这是求救信号
It's a distress call.

189
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:41,018
它被一遍又一遍地播放了16年
It's been playing over and over for 16 years.

190
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,075
伙计们
Guys...

191
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:45,038
我们在哪
Where are we?

192
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:56,084
我知道食物很短缺
I know food's scarce...

193
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,008
但你的衬衫
But your shirt?

194
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:01,068
如果你找到了一个自助洗衣店  请告诉我
When you find the laundromat, let me know.

195
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:03,075
对Hugo Reyes来说
For Hugo Reyes,

196
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,069
坠机给他带来了特殊的心理包袱
crashing on the island carried its own special burden.

197
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:09,012
我觉得飞机失事有可能是我的错
I think the plane crash might've been my fault.

198
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,059
别犯傻了  你怎么可能...
Don't be daft. How could you possibly...

199
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,014
之前无论我去哪
hey, a lot of bad stuff used to happen

200
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:15,069
总有坏事在我周围发生
whenever I was around.

201
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,066
今晚的百万大乐透
that makes tonight's

202
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:20,010
累计奖金达到...
mega lotto jackpot drawing...

203
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:21,084
Hugo买了彩票  而且中了几百万

4  8  15  16  23  42
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

205
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,032
但霉运接踵而至
but misfortune followed.

206
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:27,047
我最近也遇到一些坏事

207
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:30,017
Tito爷爷得心脏病死了

208
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:32,041
我给妈妈买的第一座房子被烧毁了
and the first house I bought my mom burnt down.

209
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:36,075
当他的炸鸡连锁店被一颗流星摧毁时
And when his chicken franchise was destroyed by a meteor...

210
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,082
他终于相信自己中奖是个诅咒

211
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,029
欢迎光临

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,029
坠机后  Hugo想要尽力寻找

213
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:48,019
小岛的光明面
the brighter side of the island.

214
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:50,056
伙计  听着  如果我们真被困在这
Dudes, listen, if we're stuck here,

215
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,056
光想着怎么活下来是不够的
then just surviving's not gonna cut it.

216
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,086
我们需要放松一下  知道吗
We need some kind of relief, you know?

217
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:58,069
我们要尽情享受生活  找点乐子
We need some way that we can, you know, have fun.

218
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:02,010
小岛对所有幸存者都产生了影响
The island had a hold on all of the survivors...

219
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:08,047
有一个人决定揭开它最深处的秘密
but one man was determined to uncover its deepest mystery.

220
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:16,021
这...   太尴尬了

221
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:19,074
John Locke去和他的亲生父亲碰面
John Locke met his biological father

222
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,021
但万万没想到自己竟然被利用了
only to learn that he was being used.

223
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,060
你偷了我的肾
You stole my kidney? You

224
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,012
你需要一个父亲  而我需要一个肾

225
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,062

Locke去和他的父亲对质

227

228

他重重地摔到地上  下肢瘫痪
He was left shattered and paralyzed,

229
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:40,099
但他最终启程前往澳大利亚

230
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:43,013
为的是一个征服澳洲内陆的梦想

231
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,016
请马上把我送上巴士  我能行

不  你不行

233
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,073
你不知道你在跟谁打交道
You don't know who you're dealing with!

234
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
永远别跟我说我不行  永远
Don't ever tell me what I can't do, ever!

John Locke从废墟中站了起来

他发现自己竟然又能走路了
and discovered he could walk again.

238
00:09:58,074 --> 00:10:00,044
这让他相信
This gave him faith

239
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:03,058
他们来岛上都是有原因的
that they were on the island for a purpose.

240
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:06,008
你觉得我们在这个地方坠机是偶然的吗
You think we crashed on this place by coincidence?

241
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:10,048
我们每个人被带到这都是有原因的
Each one of us was brought here for a reason.

242
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:12,095
是谁把我们带到这的  John

243
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:13,076
这个岛
The island.

244
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,082
但幸存者们

245
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,009
并不是第一批被带到岛上的人

246
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:20,066
达摩组织的一组科学家

247
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:23,003
在70年代来到这个岛上

248
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,090
为了研究这个岛的特殊之处
They built research stations in an attempt to understand

249
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:29,034
他们建立了研究站

250
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:30,082
独一无二的电磁波动
Unique electromagnetic fluctuations.

251
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:32,078
有一个研究站叫天鹅站

252
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,067
在那里一个叫Desmond的人数年来
Where a man named Desmond spent years

253
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:37,051
一直通过向电脑输入密码
entering a code into a computer

254
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:40,085
使海湾保持超高的电磁能
to keep a massive amount of electromagnetic energy at Bay.

255
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,095
系统崩溃  系统崩溃
System failure. System failure.

256
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,075
一天  Desmond忘了输密码
One day, Desmond neglected to enter the code

257
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:48,099
导致大洋815航班在岛上坠落
and caused Oceanic flight 815 to crash on the island.

258
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:50,082
岛上的原住民们

259
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,076
并不欢迎访客的到来

260
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:55,063
Goodwin  一小时内跑到那个海滩去

261
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:58,006
Ethan  到飞机残骸那儿

263
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,077
这不是你的岛
This is not your island.

264
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,050
这是我们的岛
This is our island.

265
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:08,067
幸存者们马上就要遇到
The Oceanic survivors would soon meet

266
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:10,091
岛上的原住民了
the island's original inhabitants.

267
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:13,070
幸存者们把这些人叫做  其他人
They would call these people the others.

268
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,091
你好  Jack
Hello, Jack.

269
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:17,038
他们的首领叫Benjamin Linus
There leader was a man named Benjamin Linus,

270
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:21,012
为了保护这个岛  他无所不用其极
and he would do anything in his power to protect the island.

271
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:24,069
如果有什么傻冒敢挡你的路  杀了他们
If any of them are stupid enough to get in your way, kill 'em.

272
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:27,046
嘿  欢迎你们来这个岛
Hey, welcome to the island, man.

273
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,046
Ben Linus来的时候是个小男孩
Ben Linus came to the island as a young boy

274
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:33,026
他的父亲参加了达摩组织
when his father joined the Dharma initiative.

275
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:36,043
但是他们过得并不愉快
But it was not a pleasant experience.

276
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,060
我在这个岛上被你缠得烦死了
I'm stuck here on this island... with you.

277
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:43,021
有一天  Ben遇到了那些人
Then one day, Ben met the others.

278
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:44,096
带我一起走
Take me with you.

279
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:46,064
你必须非常的耐心
You're gonna have to be very patient.

280
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:49,024
于是Ben蛰伏起来
So Ben waited,

281
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:51,008
直到他成长到青年
and when he became a young man...

282
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:52,098
再见  老爸
Good-bye, dad.

283
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,065
他不择手段的
He did whatever it took

284
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:59,065
帮助那些人保护这个岛远离外来的人
to help the others protect the island from outsiders

285
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:00,097
比如达摩组织
like the Dharma initiative.

286
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:02,052
你需要我们替他收尸吗
You want us to go get his body?

287
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,066
不用  就把他扔那儿
No. Leave him out there.

288
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:08,006
Ben加入了那些人并且当上了首领
Ben joined the others and rose to power as their leader.

289
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:10,063
他养有一个女儿
He raised a daughter

290
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,013
他是这个岛屿尽忠尽责的仆人
and was a devoted servant to the island.

291
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,096
John Loche的到来
But when John Locke arrived

292
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:16,034
让Ben觉得受到了威胁
Ben felt threatened

293
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,027
因为Loche对这个岛有特殊的情结
by Locke's special communion with the island.

294
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:22,001
你才呆了80天而我已经过了一整辈子
You've been here 80 days, John. I've been here my entire life.

295
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:26,075
你怎么可能比我更了解这个岛
So how is it that you think you know this island better than I do?

296
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:28,058
但并非所有那些人都视Locke为威胁
Though not all of the others regarded Locke as a threat.

297
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:30,068
有传言说
When word had gotten back here

298
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,092
飞机上有个脊柱骨折的人
that there was man with a broken spine on the plane

299
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,089
又能走路了
who could suddenly walk again...

300
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:37,012
对此我们觉得非常兴奋
Well, people here began to get very excited.

301
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,029
Locke加入了那些人
Locke joined the others

302
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:42,003
并且大有成为新首领之势
and would soon become their new leader.

303
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,099
有一个人不惜一切想要离开
But one of them wanted desperately to leave.

304
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,070
我想回家
I wanna go home.

305
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,006
这违反约定
That's not our agreement.

306
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,037
在你完成工作之前必须呆在这
You need to stay here until your work is finished.

307
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:51,060
我们到了
We're here.

308
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,057
Juliet是一个生育专家
Juliet was a fertility specialist.

309
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,037
那些人雇她查明
She was recruited by the others to find out

310
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,007
为什么这个岛上的女人都无法生育
why women on the island could not have children.

311
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:02,008
我觉得问题出在受孕阶段
I think it happens at conception.

312
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,031
对此我无能为力  至少在这儿是这样
There's nothing I can do about it... at least not here.

313
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:07,035
由于希望渺茫
The situation appeared hopeless,

314
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:10,025
Juliet转投到大洋航班幸存者这边
so Juliet joined the Oceanic survivors

315
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:13,002
希望能等到回家的机会
in hopes of finding a way home.

316
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,079
我想了解一下你的研究
I want to know about your research.

317
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,072
孕妇们都怎么了
What happens to pregnant women?

318
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,033
都死了
They all die.

319
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,063
Sun和Jin来自韩国
Sun and Jin were from Korea...

320
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,087
尽管他们门不当户不对
and despite their very different backgrounds,

321
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:32,027
他们还是相爱了
they fell in love.

322
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:38,054
他们的婚礼欢乐喜庆
Their wedding was joyful,

323
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:41,024
但他们的婚姻很快陷入了黑暗
but their marriage soon darkened,

324
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:46,068
Sun谋划着在悉尼的时候离开Jin
and Sun planned an escape from Jin when the two were in Sydney.

325
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,035
岛上的共同生活却再次把他们连在了一起
Life on the island brought them closer...

326
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,079
你怀孕了
You're pregnant.

327
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:55,059
他们再度相爱
And they fell in love once again.

328
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:58,086
但Sun的怀孕使她身陷危机
But Sun's pregnancy put her in danger.

329
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:01,043
你的妻子病得很厉害
Your wife is very sick.

330
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,007
如果她不离开这个岛  她会死的
If she doesn't get off this island, she will die.

331
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:08,020
这时  救援的希望重新到来
But there was new hope for rescue.

332
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:10,071
在岛上过了近90天以后
After nearly 90 days on the island,

333
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,074
一艘货轮航班抵达海岸不远处
a freighter arrived off the coast.

334
00:14:12,074 --> 00:14:16,061
Jack把大家带到一个信号塔处
So Jack led his group to a radio tower

335
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,034
打电话求救
to make a call for help.

336
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:21,053
我是大洋815航班的幸存者
I'm one of the survivors of Oceanic flight 815.

337
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,066
你能确定我们的位置吗
Can you get a fix on our location?

338
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,003
当然  我们可以
Hell, yeah, we can.

339
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,084
他们确信  他们终于可以回家了
They believed they'd finally found a way home.

340
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:33,063
一组来自货轮上的人乘直升机来到岛上
A group from the freighter arrived by helicopter.

341
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:38,077
我是Daniel Faraday
I'm Daniel Faraday.

342
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:41,001
我来这儿实施救援
I'm here to rescue you.

343
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:44,054
他在说什么  他说的有一半我听不懂
What's his story? Half the stuff he says goes way over my head.

344
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:46,044
另一半我下辈子都听不懂
The other half goes way, way over.

345
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,028
Daniel Faraday是一个物理学家
Daniel Faraday was a physicist

346
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:52,015
他毕生都在研究时间旅行
who devoted his life to the study of time travel.

347
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:55,019
他带着一个科研队伍来到这个岛上
He came to the island with a science team

348
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:57,099
以及他们的飞行员  Frank Lapidus
and their pilot Frank Lapidus.

349
00:14:58,006 --> 00:15:00,032
但是救援大洋航班幸存者
But rescuing the Oceanic survivors

350
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,093
并不是既定任务的一部分
was not the primary mission.

351
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:05,073
是Charles Widmore
This is Charles Widmore,

352
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:06,016
他的船停在岸边
the man whose boat is parked offshore.

353
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:07,070
他想怎么样
What does he want?

354
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,016
他想开发这个岛
Charles Widmore wants to exploit this island,

355
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:12,010
为了霸占这个岛他会不择手段
and he'll do everything in his power to possess it.

356
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:15,037
Charles Widmore有钱有势
Charles Widmore was a wealthy and powerful man

357
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:17,091
曾经是那些人的首领
who at one time was the leader of the others.

358
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:20,041
我们还会再见面的  孩子
I'll be seeing you, boy.

359
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:24,048
他被驱逐出岛  他发誓会向Ben复仇
He was banished from the island and swore vengeance on Ben.

360
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:27,015
Widmore的货轮还运载了
Widmore's freighter also carried

361
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:30,008
一支雇佣兵部队  受命俘虏Ben
a team of mercenaries with orders to capture Ben.

362
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,035
立刻给我滚出来
Get your ass out here right now.

363
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:34,062
我不会出这个房间
I'm not coming out of this house.

364
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:37,009
在对峙中
And in the process...

365
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,016
Ben的女儿Alex被杀害
Ben's daughter Alex was murdered.

366
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:43,036
你们要杀了她吗  动手啊
If you wanna kill her, go ahead and do it.

367
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:47,073
幸存者和那些人达成一项协议
So the survivors and the others made a deal...

368
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:54,010
联合起来最终打败了雇佣兵
and joined forces to defeat the mercenaries.

369
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:57,024
直升机是你的  你可以安安全全的回去
The helicopter is yours. You have a safe journey back.

370
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:00,054
那我们可以离开这个岛了
So we can go off the island?

371
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:03,068
是这个意思吗
That's it?

372
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:06,042
是这个意思
That's it.

373
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:17,090
他说什么惹你生气的话了吗  雀斑女
He say something to tick you off, Freckles?

374
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:18,081
Widmore和他的雇佣兵被打败了
With Widmore's mercenaries defeated,

375
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:22,011
这些幸存者迫不及待的想离开孤岛
the survivors were eager to leave the island.

376
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:23,098
但John Locke选择留下
But John Locke chose to stay

377
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:25,025
他向Jack提出一项请求
and had one request for Jack.

378
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:28,022
你不能说这个岛的事情
You have to lie about everything.

379
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,025
只有这样才能保护这个岛
It's the only way to protect it.

380
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:32,052
这只不过是个小岛罢了  John
It's an island, John.

381
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,072
这不是一个岛  而是奇迹发生之地
It's not an island. It's a place where miracles happen.

382
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,043
咱们走Freckles
Let's go, Freckles.

383
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:38,056
我早受够这鬼地方了
I've seen enough of this rock.

384
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,053
Jack带一些人坐直升机飞往货轮
Jack led a group to the freighter by chopper

385
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,023
科研小组带另一些人划小船过去
as the science team shuttled others by boat.

386
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,097
但是直升机一直在漏油
But the chopper was leaking fuel.

387
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:50,030
如果能减轻一百多磅
I'd feel a hell of a lot better

388
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:53,007
就好对付多了
if we were a few hundred pounds lighter.

389
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:55,044
于是Sawyer果断采取了措施
So Sawyer acted quickly...

390
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:57,004
Sawyer
Sawyer.

391
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,042
当他往回游的时候
And as he made his way back to the island...

392
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:04,007
在那儿  船  我看到了
There it is! The boat... I see it!

393
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,065
直升机接近了货轮
The chopper reached the freighter,

394
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:08,059
却发现货轮装满了炸药
only to find it was rigged with explosives.

395
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,033
是Jin  调头
It's Jin! Turn around!

396
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,019
不能调头
We can't do it.

397
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:16,096
Jin
Jin!

398
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:24,051
Sawyer游回了小岛
Sawyer reached the island...

399
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,057
你在这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

400
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:27,040
还以为他的朋友们已经安全了
Believing his friends were safe.

401
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,030
那是咱们的船吗
Is that our boat?

402
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:35,078
同时  Locke成了那些人的新首领
Meanwhile, Locke began his new role as leader of the others...

403
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:38,052
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

404
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,078
Ben下降到兰花站下面深处的一个洞穴
And Ben descended to a cavern deep below the Orchid station

405
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:44,032
要移动这个小岛
to move the island

406
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,054
以确保Charles Widmore
and ensure that Charles Widmore

407
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:47,049
再也不会找到这里
would never find it again.

408
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,087
但是移动岛屿的行为
But the act of moving the island

409
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:01,087
却产生了无比严重的副作用
created a profound side effect.

410
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,087
有人吗
Anyone?!

411
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:06,021
货轮哪去了
Where's the freighter?

412
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:09,098
刚才船还在冒着黑烟
A minute ago, that boat was coughing black smoke.

413
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,072
现在就什么也没了
Now there's just nothin'?

414
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:15,058
幸存者和货轮上的科学家们
The Oceanic survivors and the freighter scientists

415
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:18,015
被带向了一条非同寻常的旅程
were taken on an extraordinary journey.

416
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:21,004
Ben Linus在兰花站下面的行为
Whatever Ben Linus did down at the Orchid station

417
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:22,036
把我们赶出去了
dislodged us.

418
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:23,089
时间
Time.

419
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:29,023
他们时光穿梭岛上的无数个时代
They flashed through numerous time periods on the island.

420
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,057
- 现在是哪一年 - 1954年
-What year is it right now? -It's 1954.

421
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:33,090
在一次时光穿梭中
During one flash...

422
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:34,031
Jin
Jin?

423
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:39,054
他们与Jin重聚  他又活了
They reunited with Jin, who was very much alive.

424
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,083
但时光穿梭
But the flashes...

425
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,041
Charlotte
Charlotte!

426
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,031
却在逐渐消磨他们的生命

427
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,058
Locke认为他可以拯救留在岛上的人
Locke believed he knew how to save everyone left behind.

428
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:50,062
他们走了  所以才会这样
This is all happening because they left.

429
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:53,012
我们必须回兰花站
We have to go back to the Orchid.

430
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:54,047
你说什么
Excuse me?

431
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,052
那里是不幸的开始
That's where all this started.

432
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,009
也许也是一切的结束
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

433
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,000
你好John  剩下的事情我来帮你
Hello, John. I'm here to help you the rest of the way.

434
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:07,093
Locke转动了Ben转过的轮子
Locke turned the same wheel Ben turned...

435
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,034
向我儿子问好
Say hello to my son.

436
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,091
时光穿梭停止了
and the flashes stopped.

437
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:17,038
我看结束了  我想John做到了
I think it's over. I think John did it.

438
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,011
现在干什么  现在我们等他回来
Now what? Now we wait for him to come back.

439
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:25,018
John Locke转动轮子以后

加入了岛上的达摩组织

443
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:35,099
并且很快成为了那个组织的死忠
and soon became fixtures in the community.

444
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:38,039
- 嘿  头儿  - 晚上好  Enos
-Hey, Boss. -Evening, Enos.

445
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,033
Sawyer被任命为安防长官

446
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,060
Juliet成了技工
Juliet became a mechanic...

447
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:44,030
闻起来不错哦
Somethin' smells good.

448
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:47,044
他们两人在岛上共同生活
And the two made a life together on the island.

449
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,034
- 我爱你  - 我也爱你

450
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:58,085
John Locke转动轮子的时候
When John Locke turned the wheel,

451
00:19:58,091 --> 00:20:01,092
他被传送到突尼斯沙漠

452
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:04,015
未来的第三年  2007
Three years in the future, to 2007.

453
00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:07,009
他得到了Charles Widmore的帮助
He soon received help from Charles Widmore.

454
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:09,022
你那些留在岛上的朋友们
All your friends who left the island?

455
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,056
他们都已经回去了三年了
They've been back three years.

456
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:13,028
他们重新过上了正常的生活

457
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,036
我必须把他们带回去
I have to bring them back.

458
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:17,053
我会尽己所能帮你这个忙
And I'm gonna do everything in my power to help you do that.

459
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
于是Locke动身
So Locke set out

460
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:22,023
去说服他的朋友们回到那个岛上
to convince his friends to come back to the island.

461
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,075
我不会回去的
I'm not going back.

462
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,047
答案是不
The answer is no.

463
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:26,008
不  我哪也不去
No, I'm not going anywhere with you.

464
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,081
我只需要说服一个人
I only need to convince one,

465
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:30,094
其他的人就会一起来了
and if I can do that, the rest will come.

466
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,084
Locke的任务是艰巨的
Locke's task was difficult,

467
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:35,078
但此时这项任务已经变成了危险的

468
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:44,093
Locke的不幸再度给了他一个机会
Locke's misfortune gave him one more chance.

469
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:46,056
你想干什么
What are you doing here?

470
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:47,097
我们必须回去
We have to go back.

471
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:49,032
因为是我们的命运
Because it's our destiny?

472
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,096
你要把这句话重复多少遍
How many times are you gonna say that to me?

473
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:53,040
再见  John
Good-bye, John.

474
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,050
你的父亲向你问好
Your father says hello.

475
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:55,073
什么
What?

476
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,087
他说他的名字叫Christian

477
00:20:57,093 --> 00:21:00,088
他三年前就在澳大利亚死了

478
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:03,007
我把他放进棺材里的  他死了

479
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:05,067
你离我远点
You leave me alone,

480
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:07,098
离其他人也远点
and you leave the rest of 'em alone!

481
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:13,083
Locke觉得他失败了
Locke believed he had failed,

482
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,041
正当他绝望的时候
but in his despair...

483
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,089
别这样
Come on.

484
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:20,059
Ben Linus找到了回岛的机会
Ben Linus found an opportunity to get back to the island

485
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:22,036
他可以继续当从前的他

486
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:24,040
我知道去哪里
I know where we go.

487
00:21:24,046 --> 00:21:26,050
在洛杉矶有个女的
There's a woman here in Los Angeles.

488
00:21:26,056 --> 00:21:27,097
叫Eloise Hawking
Eloise Hawking.

489
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:30,035
Eloise Hawking  你确定
Eloise Hawking? You sure?

490
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,040
怎么了  你认识她

491

把我们带回岛上
Fly us back to the island!

498
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060

That's it, people! We're out of fuel!

503

514
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,045
飞机失事的时候
Claire was 8 months pregnant

515
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:50,014
Claire已经怀孕8个月了
at the time of the crash,

516
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:53,074
她是去洛杉矶找领养她孩子的人

不久之后  Claire也失踪了

为了保护岛上的朋友

540
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:55,047
他们扭曲了坠机之后发生的事

有没有可能

-还没被发现  -这不可能

551
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:23,002
希望有一天飞机会坠毁到岛上

我能再来一杯吗

还是来份报纸吧

557
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,030
他居然和Ben成为了伙伴

558
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,098
你好  Jack

好极了
Fantastic.

699
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:53,049
我们都对一个人负责  John
We all answer to someone, John.

700
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:56,086
-那他是谁  -他叫Jacob
- And whom might that be? - His name is Jacob.

701
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:59,056
那个叫Jacob的男人
The man known as Jacob

702
00:30:59,063 --> 00:31:01,067
对于岛上的居民来说是个迷
was a mystery to the island inhabitants.

703
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:02,069
Jacob想这么做
Jacob wanted it done.

704
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,003
Jacob只跟我说话  John
Jacob talks to me, John.

705
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,047
没有其他人见过他
No one else has ever seen him?

706
00:31:06,054 --> 00:31:08,071
-是的  -这也太省事了
- That's right. - How convenient.

707
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:12,026
几个世纪以来
Jacob was a

708
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:14,081
Jacob就是这个岛的精神象征
spiritual presence on the island for centuries

709
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:18,032
他见到过很多人到这个岛上
and has seen many people make their way to his home.

710
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:20,086
我想你在这是因为那艘船
I take it you're here 'cause of the ship.

711
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,062
他们怎么会找到这个岛
How did they find the island?

712
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:25,016
他们到了之后你去问问
You'll have to ask 'em when they get here.

713
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,069
我不用问  你把他们带来的
I don't have to ask. You brought them here.

714
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:29,091
你还想证明我错了  是吗
Still trying to prove me wrong, aren't you?

715
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:30,063
你是错了
You are wrong.

716
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:32,046
是吗
Am I?

717
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:34,010
Jacob的乐观
Jacob's optimism

718
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:36,063
对于他的对手来说正好相反
was a stark contrast to his Nemesis.

719
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,013
他们来到这里  打斗
They come. They fight.

720
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,077
破坏  堕落
They destroy. They corrupt.

721
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:42,077
事实总是如此
It always ends the same.

722
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:44,084
这只发生过一次
It only ends once.

723
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:49,019
发生那些事之前的  就算是进步了
Anything that happens before that is just progress.

724
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:52,003
但他跟这个黑衣人的冲突
But the conflict with this man in black

725
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,073
有规则阻止他们互相伤害
had rules which prevented them from harming one another.

726
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,083
你知道我有多想杀了你吗
Do you have any idea how badly I want to kill you?

727
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,007
知道
Yes.

728
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:02,024
总有一天我会找到机会的  朋友
One of these days, I'm going to find a loophole, my friend.

729
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:05,011
那好  当你找到了  我就在这儿等你
Well, when you do, I'll be right here.

730
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:07,058
Jacob并没有把自己禁锢在小岛上
Jacob did not confine himself to the island.

731
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:09,063
抱歉  先生  你能帮我下吗
Excuse me, sir? Could you help me?

732
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:11,011
你想找什么
What are you looking for?

733
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:13,082
他和大洋生还者仍保持着联系
He made contact with some of the Oceanic survivors...

734
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,095
在他们生命中重要的时刻
at critical moments in their lives...

735
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:21,056
别害怕  你不会有事的
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.

736
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:24,029
尽管他们根本不知道他是谁
Though they had no idea who he was.

737
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,016
是你的吗 我想我只是需要再努力点
one of these yours? I guess it just needed a little push.

738
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:35,000
Jacob的有些来访甚至远远早于
Some of Jacob's visits occurred long before

739
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:37,007
大洋号飞机坠毁于小岛的时间
the Oceanic passengers crashed on the island.

740
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:39,064
我对你父母的事深表遗憾  James
I'm very sorry about your mother and father, James.

741
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:41,098
听话啊  Katie
Be good, Katie.

742
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:44,081
对其他人...   抱歉
And for others... Oh. Sorry.

743
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,043
其实  我就在下几个街口下车
Actually, I'm only going a few blocks,

744
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:48,015
如果你愿意我们可以一起  他一直引导
if you want to share. He provided guidance

745
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:49,032
他们直到他们最终
that would eventually lead

746
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:51,045
回到小岛上  Ajira316航班
them back to the island. Ajira airways flight 316.

747
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,062
你自己决定  Hugo
It's your choice, Hugo.

748
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:57,019
但在小岛上  Jacob一直是个谜
But on the island, Jacob remained a mystery,

749
00:32:57,026 --> 00:33:01,023
同时有个人非常渴望找到他  有段时间
and one man was very eager to find him. For some time,

750
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:04,063
你们一直听命于一个叫Jacob的人
you all have been accepting orders from a man named Jacob.

751
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,030
我将要去会会Jacob
Well, I'm gonna go and see Jacob,

752
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:09,043
同时我希望你们都可以和我一起去
and I'd like all of you to come with me.

753
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,027
我开始觉得John Lock会成为个大麻烦
I'm starting to think John Locke is gonna be trouble.

754
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:15,014
你以为我为什么想杀了他
Why do you think I tried to kill him?

755
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:18,004
我知道我们过去一直有分歧  John
I know we've had our differences in the past, John,

756
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,064
可如果你需要Jacob帮你和你的人重聚
but if you need Jacob to help you reunite your people,

757
00:33:20,071 --> 00:33:22,001
那我愿意做任何
then I'll do whatever...

758
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,081
我对和我的人重聚没兴趣
I'm not interested in being reunited with my people.

759
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:27,057
那我们去见Jacob是为什么
Then why are we going to Jacob?

760
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:28,002
因为这样我就可以杀了他
So I can kill him.

761
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:31,042
可为了能杀了Jacob  这个人需要帮助
But in order to kill Jacob, this man needed help.

762
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:34,089
你为什么要我杀了Jacob  John
Why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?

763
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,066
因为
Because...

764
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:39,073
尽管你对这个岛如此忠心耿耿
Despite your loyal service to this island,

765
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,010
你却不得不亲眼看着自己女儿被枪杀
you had to watch your own daughter gunned down

766
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:45,087
可你的奖励呢  却是被驱逐出这个岛
right in front of you. And your reward? You were banished.

767
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:47,094
而你所做的一切
And you did all this

768
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,077
都是以一个你从未见过的人的名义
in the name of a man you've never even met.

769
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:53,037
所以这个问题应该是  Ben
So the question is, Ben,

770
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:56,024
你他妈为什么不想杀了Jacob
why the hell wouldn't you wanna kill Jacob?

771
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:59,011
但是Jacob在Ajira航班上有朋友
But Jacob had friends aboard the Ajira flight.

772
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:02,042
箱子里是什么  我们得给某人看看
What's in the box? We need to show it to somebody.

773
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:05,065
为什么  让他们知道他们在和谁对着干
What for? So they'll know who they're up against.

774
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:13,029
Ilana是Jacob的忠实追随者
Ilana was a devoted follower of Jacob...

775
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:17,023
他也出现在她的关键时刻
and he came to her at a critical time.

776
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,073
我在这儿因为我需要你帮助
I'm here because I need your help.

777
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,077
你愿帮我吗  Ilana
Will you help me, Ilana?

778
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,070
愿意
Yes.

779
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:25,067
但是这个长得像Locke的人
But the man who looked like Locke

780
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:29,041
最终到达了他的目的地
finally reached his destination.

781
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,051
你好  Jacob
Hello, Jacob.

782
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:34,081
你找到机会了
Well, you found your loophole.

783
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:36,085
确实是
Indeed I did.

784
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:40,032
而且你无法想象
And you have no idea

785
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:42,095
为了到这里
what I've gone through

786
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:44,042
我经历了些什么
to be here.

787
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,052
你俩以前见过吗
Have you met before?

788
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:48,059
某种意义上上来说是
In a manner of speaking.

789
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:53,043
外面
Outside...

790
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,097
Ilana和她的队伍到了
Ilana and her team arrived.

791
00:34:56,003 --> 00:34:57,063
别开枪
Don't shoot.

792
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,007
Richard  我是Ilana
Richard, I'm Ilana.

793
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:03,027
我有东西给你看
I have something you need to see.

794
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:09,028
我不懂了
I don't understand.

795
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:12,021
如果这个是Locke
If this is Locke...

796
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:13,081
那里面的是谁
Who's in there?

797
00:35:15,065 --> 00:35:18,029
一切都准备就绪了
All the pieces were in place...

798
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,082
做我叫你做的  Ben
Do what I asked you to, Ben.

799
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:22,096
留给Ben面对面...
Leaving Ben face-to-face...

800
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:25,039
Benjamin...和这个岛的精神领袖
Benjamin... With the island's spiritual leader.

801
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:29,066
不论他和你说了什么  我想你懂一件事
Whatever he's told you, I want you to understand one thing...

802
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:32,057
你一直有选择的机会
you have a choice.

803
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:36,070
但Jacob无视Ben太久了
But Jacob had neglected Ben for far too long.

804
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:42,027
终于现在  经过那么多次
Oh... so now, after all this time,

805
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:45,094
你终于决定不在无视我了
you've decided to stop ignoring me.

806
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:50,028
可惜
Well...

807
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:58,072
他们要来了
they're coming.

808
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,086
什么
What?

809
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:01,072
他们要来了
They're coming.

810
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,087
让我把这事搞清楚
Let me get this straight.

811
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:27,001
所有的这些事都已经发生了  是的
All this already happened. Yes.

812
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:29,037
那么我下一句会说什么  我不知道
Then what am I gonna say next? I don't know.

813
00:36:29,044 --> 00:36:31,091
哈  那你就是谬论
Ha! Then your theory is wrong!

814
00:36:31,098 --> 00:36:33,098
Hugo企图理解时空旅行
Hugo attempted to comprehend

815
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:36,005
的复杂规则
the complex laws of time travel,

816
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:38,072
同时Jack和Kate
and along with Jack and Kate,

817
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:40,082
他尽力让自己适应1970年达摩组织的
he did his best to adjust to life

818
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:43,029
生活 我们为什么不拼车
in the Dharma initiative of the 1970s. Why don't we carpool?

819
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,066
这可以减慢全球变暖  当然现在还没发生
It'll help with global warming, which hasn't happened yet,

820
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:47,059
所以或许我们可以阻止它
so maybe we can prevent it.

821
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:49,046
Sawyer的掩饰故事很成功
Sawyer's cover story worked,

822
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:52,076
他们各自都在社区中被分配了工作
and they were each assigned jobs within the community.

823
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,050
记得试试这个蘸酱
And don't forget to try the dipping sauces.

824
00:36:55,057 --> 00:36:56,092
真的把火腿变的更好吃
They really bring out the ham.

825
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:58,090
但他们的到来给Juilet带来很大压力
But their arrival weighed heavily on Juliet,

826
00:36:58,097 --> 00:37:01,010
她知道关于Sawyer和Kate的过去
who knew Sawyer's history with Kate

827
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:04,041
也相信她和Sawyer的生活将从此改变
and believed her life with Sawyer would never be the same.

828
00:37:04,048 --> 00:37:06,011
一切都结束了  不是吗
It's over, isn't it?

829
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:07,078
什么结束了
What's over?

830
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:09,098
我们的过家家
Us... playing house.

831
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:13,012
我们在边界上抓了个人质
We got a hostile inside the perimeter.

832
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:14,068
对Sayid来说  快走
As for Sayid... Move.

833
00:37:14,075 --> 00:37:16,075
他和他的朋友在
He was separated from his friends

834
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:18,092
闪光的时候失散了
at the time of the flash,

835
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:20,052
同时他的到来也引起别人对新成员
and his arrival aroused suspicion

836
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:22,056
的猜疑 我想我们找到Sayid
of the new recruits. I guess we found Sayid.

837
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:25,033
但在这岛上的所有事...谁能帮我下吗
But everything on the island... Hey, can I get a hand with this?

838
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,060
都即将改变  Dan
Was about to change. Dan.

839
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:30,077
是你啊  Miles
Hey, Miles.

840
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,080
你他妈回来干什么啊  Dan
What the hell are you doing back here, Dan?

841
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:35,060
这是我回来干的事
This is what I'm doing back here.

842
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:38,054
Daniel Faraday和大洋生还者一起忍受着
Daniel Faraday endured the time flashes on the island

843
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:40,084
时空闪回的痛苦
with the rest of the Oceanic` survivors,

844
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,035
在1950年间的到访让
and during a visit to the 1950s,

845
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:46,072
他知道其他人有氢弹
he learned the others had a hydrogen bomb.

846
00:37:46,078 --> 00:37:49,092
你得把这个从发射台上拆下来埋了
You need to take it off this platform and bury it.

847
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:52,035
当Faraday出现在1970年时
When Faraday arrived in the 1970s,

848
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,032
他集中全力在找到一条
he focused his energies on finding a way

849
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,023
改变未来的方法
to change the future,

850
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:58,056
同时新的达摩站正在建设中
and with a new Dharma station under construction,

851
00:37:58,063 --> 00:38:00,016
时机非常完美
the timing was perfect.

852
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:02,046
达摩组织的人在天鹅站
The Dharma folks at the Swan work site...

853
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:03,077
他们就要钻到地底下了
they're gonna drill into the ground

854
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:06,018
会意外接触到巨大能量
and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy.

855
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:08,001
为了控制它  他们不得不水泥浇灌
In order to contain it, they're gonna have to

856
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:10,088
整个区域  就像切尔诺贝利核电站
cement the entire area in, like Chernobyl.

857
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:13,099
他们将花费下个20年
they're gonna spend the next 20 years

858
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:16,029
靠按按钮控制那个地下能量
keeping that energy at bay by pressing a button...

859
00:38:16,036 --> 00:38:18,099
你们的朋友Desmond  系统错误
A button that your friend Desmond... system failure.

860
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,059
有天将没来得及去按那按钮
Will one day fail to push,

861
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,083
而导致你们的飞机在这个岛上失事
and that will cause your plane to crash on this island.

862
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,035
我觉得我们可以改变这个
I think we can change that.

863
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:30,036
这样那个舱就永远不会被建成
Then that hatch will never be built,

864
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:33,016
你们的飞机就会像原定计划安全着陆
and your plane will land just like it's supposed to.

865
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:36,043
那你究竟打算怎么摧毁那股能量
And just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?

866
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,050
我会引爆那颗氢弹
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

867
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:42,003
Jack受到了鼓舞
Jack was inspired.

868
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,023
那个炸弹在哪里  Richard
Where's the bomb, Richard? Where is it?

869
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,087
当 Faraday被枪杀后
and when Faraday was shot and killed,

870
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,049
Jack承担了Faraday的使命
Jack assumed Faraday's mission.

871
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:52,084
我们从那飞机上消失到了这里
We disappeared off that plane and ended up here

872
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:55,044
是因为这是我们的命运
because this is our destiny.

873
00:38:55,051 --> 00:38:58,088
Jack说服其他人带他找到那炸弹
Jack convinced the others to take him to the bomb.

874
00:38:58,095 --> 00:39:02,045
如果他能够阻止大洋815航班坠毁
If he could prevent flight 815 from ever crashing,

875
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:05,039
他就可以消除幸存者忍受的
he could eliminate all the pain and suffering

876
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:07,009
的痛苦和煎熬
the survivors endured.

877
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:09,036
现在干什么
Well... now what?

878
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:14,013
利用Faraday的日记当做指导
Using Faraday's journal as a guide,

879
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,053
Sayid取出了炸弹的核心
Sayid extracted the core of the bomb.

880
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,030
但是去天鹅站只有一条路可走
But there was only one way to get to the Swan site...

881
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:24,061
就是穿越达摩组织的居住地
and that was through the Dharma compound...

882
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:27,041
大事不好了  不是吗
that's not good, right?

883
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:29,094
抓住Sayid和其余的新来成员
Which was already on High alert

884
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,011
已经是最高的警报了
to hunt down Sayid and the rest of the new arrivals.

885
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:46,029
上车
Get in.

886
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:49,020
在Jin和Hurley的帮助下  Jack和Sayid逃脱了
with Jin and Hurley's help, Jack and Sayid escaped.

887
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:51,063
我不知道我们要去哪儿  天鹅站
I don't know where we're going. The Swan site.

888
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,080
那是什么  Jack  天鹅站是什么
What it is. Jack, what's at the Swan?

889
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:56,077
我想我找到了让你回到你老婆身边的办法
I think I found a way to get you back to your wife.

890
00:39:58,037 --> 00:40:00,070
别担心  兄弟
Don't worry, dude.

891
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:03,090
Jack改变了未来后一切都没事了
Everything'll be fine when Jack changes the future.

892
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:06,037
是时候了我该走了
It's time for me to go.

893
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,089
小心  它只要一受撞击就会爆炸
Be careful. It's rigged to explode on impact.

894
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:11,047
Sayid  这回一定会成功
Sayid, this is gonna work.

895
00:40:11,054 --> 00:40:14,094
Jack准备好了  洛杉矶见
Jack was ready... See you in Los Angeles.

896
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:17,085
可在他可以结束一切开始的地方时  Jack
But before he could finish what he started... Jack?

897
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:20,078
他需要Kate站在他这边
He needed Kate on his side.

898
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:24,042
我一生中从来没像这次如此确信过
Nothing in my life has ever felt so right.

899
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,085
我只需要你相信我
I just need you to believe that.

900
00:40:30,046 --> 00:40:32,033
这个关不上了
it won't shut down!

901
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,029
有东西把钻头往下拉  我们钻到中心了
Something's pulling the drill down. We hit the pocket!

902
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:38,083
就要发生了
It's about to happen.

903
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,013
这次你相信我吗
Are you with me on this?

904
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,060
相信
Yes.

905
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:45,047
那我们走
Then let's go.

906
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:48,017
当Jack接近了天鹅站
When Jack approached the Swan site,

907
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:50,038
达摩组织的警卫发现了他
he was spotted by Dharma security...

908
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:56,008
但是救援很快就到了
but help soon arrived.

909
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:04,065
把枪放下
Aah! Put your guns down.

910
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:07,009
好了  你可以下去了  医生
All right, you can come down out now, doc!

911
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,073
大多数人相信完成的事
Most believe that what's done

912
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,020
就已经结束了
is done.

913
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:21,040
你无论多努力
You cannot change fate,

914
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:23,084
都无法改变命运
no matter how hard you try.

915
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:30,061
而那些挑战命运之事的人
And those who challenge what is destined

916
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:33,078
总是会
will always be met

917
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:35,032
以失败告终
with disappointment...

918
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:42,085
这里可不像洛杉矶机场
this don't look like LAX

919
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:48,094
命运总会
for fate has a way...

920
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:51,033
做主它自己的进程
of charting its own course.

921
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:53,045
救命  Juilet
Aah! Help! Juliet!

922
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:57,025
救命  Juilet
Help! Juliet!

923
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:59,082
不
aah! No!

924
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,068
不
No! Aah!

925
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:03,029
不准你离开我
Don't you leave me.

926
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:05,056
没事的
it's okay.

927
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,071
不准你离开我  我爱你
Don't you leave me! I love you.

928
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:11,063
不  你别放手  我爱你  James
No, you don't let go. I love you, James.

929
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:13,085
不  我真的爱你
No. I love you so much.

930
00:42:13,085 --> 00:42:16,045
不  不  别放手
No! No, don't let go! Aah!

931
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:18,001
Juliet!
Juliet!

932
00:42:22,062 --> 00:42:25,076
可在人们向命运之手投降之前
But before one surrenders to the hands of destiny...

933
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:28,051
有人或许会考虑到
one might consider

934
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:33,013
人类精神的力量
the power of the human spirit...

935
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:38,050
和流淌在人自由意志里的
and the force that lies

936
00:42:39,097 --> 00:42:43,086
巨大力量
in one's own free will.

937
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:45,002
快爆啊
Come on!

938
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:46,097
快爆啊
come on!

939
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,096
快啊  你这个狗娘养的
Come on, you son of a bitch!
