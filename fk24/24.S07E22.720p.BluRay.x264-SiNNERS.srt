1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,020
《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,026
沃克探员告诉我还有希望
Agent Walker told me that there's a chance,

3
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,003
有一线希望  我可能救得了你
A small chance that I could help you.

4
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:23,053
我快死了
I'm dying.

5
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,036
即便有能让我幸存的一线生机
And whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,096
我也决不愿承受  让你坐在我身边
It is not worth the pain for me to let you

7
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,083
看我死去时的那种切肤之痛
Sit there and watch me die.

8
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:34,023
爸  我不想失去你
Daddy, I don't want to lose you.

9
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:36,033
过来
Come here.

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,000
我不想失去你
I don't.

11
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:39,053
怎么了
What is it?

12
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,090
宝贝  抱歉
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,

13
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:44,020
可你得走了
But you need to go.

14
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:45,086
霍奇斯是今天所有事件的主谋
Hodges was behind everything that happened today,

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,010
从飞机的失事
From the planes going down

16
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,030
-一直到袭击白宫  -什么
- To the attack on the white house. - What?

17
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,036
他还该为我弟弟的死负责
He's also responsible for the death of my brother.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,010
你要知道的就是霍奇斯拿到了协议
All you need to know is Hodges worked a deal.

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,063
证人保护协议  我母亲批准了
Witness protection. My mother approved it

20
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:59,087
然后他就会逍遥法外  除非有人出面干涉
And he's going free... unless someone intervenes.

21
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:02,026
我会给你联系方式  价钱
I'll get you contact information, a price

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,010
还有你如何转账的说明
And instructions on how to transfer the funds.

23
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:07,013
马丁  我是奥利维亚·泰勒
Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.

24
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:08,046
我跟你找的人谈过了
I spoke to the contact,

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,043
但没有谈成
But I couldn't go through with it.

26
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,016
吉布安  听我说
Listen to me, Jibraan.

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,066
如果你不照我说的做
If you don't do exactly as I say,

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,023
你会眼睁睁看着你弟弟死在你面前
You're going to watch your younger brother die right in front of your eyes.

29
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:28,016
然后
And then...

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,026
我也会杀了你
I'm gonna kill you.

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,043
我们的父母死在美国人手上  哈米德
It was the Americans who killed our parents, Hamid.

32
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:34,003
我要让他们血债血偿
I'm going to make them pay.

33
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,043
你对我哥做了什么
What have you done to my brother?

34
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:37,003
你给他洗脑了吗  这根本就不是我哥
You've poisoned his mind! This isn't my brother!

35
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,083
我们在找一个在这里朝拜的人
We're looking for a man who worships here.

36
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:41,010
他叫吉布安·阿尔扎利安  你认识他吗
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian. Do you know him?

37
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:44,083
我认识他  但他不是恐怖分子
I know him, but he is not a terrorist.

38
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:46,070
我们来不是要和你争论这个问题
We did not come here to debate this with you!

39
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,093
他住在哪里
Where does he live?!

40
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:49,010
你带着莫须有的消息
You come into a house of worship

41
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:51,010
闯入我的礼拜堂
With information you should not have,

42
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:52,066
肆无忌惮的指控
An outrageous accusation,

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,013
没有合法的搜查令  还威胁我
No legal warrant and threaten me.

44
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:57,026
我没有威胁你
I have not threatened you.

45
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,062
暂时还没
Not yet.

46
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:01,000
但我们都知道接下来会发生什么
But we both know where this is going.

47
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:02,066
杰克  我是克罗伊  我发现
Jack, it's Chloe. I found something weird

48
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,050
吉布安·阿尔扎利安的事有些蹊跷
About these hits on Jibraan Al-zarian.

49
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:06,010
我告诉过你他的账户
You know how I said that the $2 million

50
00:02:06,013 --> 00:02:08,050
在6个月内总共存入了2百万美元
Was deposited into his account over a period of six months?

51
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,096
那不对  时间被提前了
Well, that wasn't right. They were backdated.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,070
他浏览过的那些极端分子网站呢
What about the extremist web sites he was visiting?

53
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:13,043
时间标记也是一样的情况
Same thing with the time stamps.

54
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,023
网站访问时间是30分钟前被篡改提前的
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.

55
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:17,020
吉布安很可能是无辜的
Jibraan could be innocent.

56
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:18,070
什么情况  探员
What do you have, agent?

57
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:20,093
武装分子在里屋  持有一名人质
Armed hostile in the back room holding a hostage.

58
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,097
有阿尔梅达的消息吗
What about Almeida?

59
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:23,096
他不在里面  自己看吧
He's not in there. see for yourself.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,016
不是
No.

61
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,073
那是吉布安的弟弟  哈米德
That's Jibraan's brother, Hamid.

62
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:30,013
他们以他来要挟  让吉布安唯命是从
They're using him as leverage to make Jibraan do what they want.

63
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,002
你怎么那么肯定
How can you be sure?

64
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:32,050
因为若是我也会这么干
Because that's what I would have done.

65
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:39,096
哈米德  住手
Hamid, stop!

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,076
把玻璃放下
Put it down.

67
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,021
我们是联邦调查局  我们需要留活口
We're FBI. We need him alive.

68
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:48,004
以下情节发生在凌晨5点至6点间
The following takes place between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.

69
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:55,006
正改装毒气罐以扩大杀伤范围
The canister's being retrofitted to maximize dispersion.

70
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,000
我们计划一小时内
We're on target to release the bioweapon

71
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:59,030
在华盛顿中央车站释放毒气
At Washington Central Station within the hour.

72
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:01,090
你估计的伤亡数准确吗
Your casualty estimates are holding up?

73
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:03,016
只是保守数字
I think they're conservative.

74
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,076
很大一部分病原体
A significant portion of the pathogen will escape

75
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,020
会进入到车站通风系统
Into the station's ventilation system,

76
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:08,066
再传播到别处
Which will circulate it for us.

77
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,086
8千至1万名乘客会暴露在毒气中
Between 8,000 and 10,000 commuters will be exposed.

78
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,036
给我说说阿尔扎利安先生的情况
Tell me about Mr. Al-zarian.

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,023
他听话吗
Is he compliant?

80
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:19,016
是的  他目前最关心的是他弟弟的安危
Yes. His primary concern at this point is for the safety of his brother.

81
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,056
很好
All right.

82
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,030
关于这次计划他知道多少
What's his level of awareness regarding the plan?

83
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:25,066
要到回天无力的地步他才会知道
He won't know anything about the canister until it's too late.

84
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,043
很好  事成之后我们再谈
Good. We'll talk once it's done.

85
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,043
启动装置运转正常
Trigger mechanism's working.

86
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:06,050
这个装置会随时跟踪你的位置
This device will tell me where you are at all times.

87
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:09,060
我们还可以通过它交谈
It will also allow us to talk to each other.

88
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:11,020
谈什么
Talk about what?

89
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:13,043
你还没有告诉我到底要我做什么
You still haven't told me what you want me to do.

90
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:16,066
现在我只想让你搭地铁
Right now I just want you to get on the subway

91
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,070
搭乘红线列车坐到华盛顿中心
And take the Red Line all the way to Washington Center.

92
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:21,046
我到那以后呢
And when I get there?

93
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,033
到时你就知道了
I'll let you know then.

94
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:25,093
我不傻
I'm not stupid.

95
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:29,010
我知道你这么做是想让我背黑锅
I know you are going to blame me for something.

96
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,086
-吉布安  -你想做什么
- Jibraan... - What's your plan, huh?

97
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,050
你要伤害平民吗
You are going to hurt people?

98
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:37,040
吉布安  你现在唯一要担心的
Jibraan, the only person you need to worry about right now

99
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,066
是你弟弟
Is your brother.

100
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,006
你照我说的做  哈米德就不会死
You follow my instructions, and hamid lives.

101
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,050
你要是做傻事  他会死得很难看
You do something stupid, and he dies... badly.

102
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,086
明白了吗
Understood?

103
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,026
明白
Good.

104
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,006
坐红线列车一路向西
Red line, westbound,

105
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,086
到华盛顿中心  听懂了吗
To washington center, got it?

106
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,050
走了  快点
Let's go. come on.

107
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:24,086
很抱歉发生这样的事
Sorry this had to happen like this.

108
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:28,040
我们会找到你哥哥的
We will find your brother.

109
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,040
你该跟他谈谈
You should talk to him.

110
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,026
这孩子什么都不知道
Kid doesn't know anything,

111
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,076
只知道他哥是在半小时前被托尼带走的
Except that his brother was taken by Tony about a half an hour ago.

112
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,093
他也没听到关于袭击目标和时间的话
He didn't overhear anything about a target or the time frame.

113
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:50,042
目前他是我们唯一的线索
Right now, he's our only lead.

114
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,012
他伤得很重
He's badly injured.

115
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:54,023
-我不知道他能不能开口  -老天啊
- I don't know if he's in any condition to talk. - My god!

116
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:57,036
按着他的头  我要给他打点吗啡
Hold his head. I'm going to give him some morphine.

117
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,030
你不能给他打
No, you're not.

118
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,033
他的伤口在神经密布区
His wound is in the middle of a nerve cluster.

119
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:04,023
-他会痛得休克的  -我知道
- He can go into shock from the pain. - I know.

120
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:05,093
让开
Back off.

121
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,090
我要你去屋外边
I want you to step out of the room.

122
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:20,016
交给你了
Do what you need to do.

123
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,090
阿尔梅达在哪里
Where's Almeida?

124
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,089
求你了  给我打点吗啡吧
Please, just give me the morphine.

125
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:27,033
你老实交代  就给你吗啡
I'll give you the morphine as soon as you talk.

126
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,076
托尼·阿尔梅达在哪
Where's Tony Almeida?

127
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,006
袭击目标是什么
What's the target?

128
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,043
我不知道
I don't know...

129
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:36,090
-袭击目标是什么  -我不知道
- What's the target?! - I don't know!

130
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:38,020
我说的是实话
I'm telling you the truth!

131
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:40,066
我的任务只是看着这小子监控这里的情况
My job was just to watch the kid and monitor things here.

132
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,076
阿尔梅达没告诉我
Almeida didn't tell me

133
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,036
他要去哪里或者袭击目标在哪里
Where he was going or where the target is.

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,050
你怎么跟他联系
How do you contact him?

135
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,083
我不能说
I can't.

136
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,040
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

137
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,063
我有一个号码
I have a number.

138
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,086
但只有紧急情况的时候我才能打
But I'm not supposed to use it unless there's a problem.

139
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,006
你最好赶快编一个出来
You better start thinking of one fast.

140
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,010
他电话在哪里

在这

你让克罗伊追踪这个号码
I want you to get Chloe to run a trace on this number.

叫她把追踪信息反馈到我们手机上
Tell her to feed it back to our cell phones.

146
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,063
你最好赶快想想要说什么

147
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,050
你要是敢耍花招
You try and screw with me on this,

148
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,086
这将是你这辈子做的最后一件事了  明白没
It'll be the last thing you ever do. You understand me?

149
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,060
明白了吗
Do you understand me?

150
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:28,026

- From a GSM ID. - I can do that.

155

为什么那么做
Why would you do that?

164
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:57,016
怎么了
What?

165
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,096
你知道通过直接内存存储连接节点更快的
You know connecting through a DMA node would be a lot faster.

No, I don't know it's quicker to use a DMA node

167
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:03,063
否则刚才我就那么做了
Or else I would have done just that.

168
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:05,020
我不知道直接内存存储节点上传运行中
I had no idea the DMA nodes were up and running.

169
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,063
是吗  因为这个已经上传运行了两年多
Really? Because they've been up and running for about two years.

170
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:11,060
听起来显然我不可能
It's obvious sound that I'll never be able to do things

171
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:13,016
像你在反恐小组那样工作出色
As well as you did at CTU.

172
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,096
我只要求在你指出这点的时候
All I ask is that you not make me feel like an idiot

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,090
不用让我感觉像个白痴
While you're pointing that out.

174
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:20,056

说拒绝了一项阿尔扎利安的转账
Rejecting one of the transfers we made in Al-zarian's name.

188
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,066
你应该知道怎么重新提交申请吧
You know how to resubmit it?

189
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,020
我不太确定
I'm not sure.

190
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:04,063

打电话给我们苏黎世的人

196
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,036

我们得把那个范围缩小

我不知道司法部也介入了

知道霍格斯还活着

It stands to reason that information was leaked.

276
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,076
好吧  我会尽快回去的
Okay, I'll get there as soon as I can.

277
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,090
您在哪里
Where are you?

278
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:58,016
我有件私人事情要办
I needed to run a personal errand.

279
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,053
阁下  我能把这理解成
Ma'am, am I to understand

280
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:01,046
您已经离开了白宫范围
That you've left the white house premises

281
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,026
而且没有特工的保护吗
Without secret service protection?

282
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,030
亚伦  我不会花太久的
I won't be long, Aaron.

283
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,040
就10分钟
Ten minutes.

284
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,060
泰勒小姐
Ms. Taylor,

285
00:14:06,063 --> 00:14:09,036
这个很严肃地违反了协议
This is a serious breach of protocol.

286
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,066
您的安全就是我的职责
Your safety is my responsibility.

287
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,090
亚伦  我明白
Aaron, I know.

288
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:15,063
我答应你没有下次了
I promise you it won't happen again.

289
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:18,053
仅仅替我掩护一下到我回去
Just cover for me till I get back?

290
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:22,036
你能帮我吗  亚伦
Will you do that for me, Aaron?

291
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:25,016
是的  阁下
Yes, ma'am.

292
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,080
谢谢
Thank you.

293
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:36,030
这是个错误  马丁  我们不该见面的
This is a mistake, Martin. We shouldn't be meeting.

294
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:37,056
你需要冷静下来  奥利维亚
Okay, you need to calm down, Olivia.

295
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,080
我需要见到你  电话里你都歇底斯里了
I needed to see you; you were hysterical on the phone.

296
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,096
你不明白  现在都有调查了
No, you don't understand! There's an investigation.

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,033
司法部都在询问我在哪了
Look, the justice department is asking about my whereabouts!

298
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,036
你以为当政府证人被谋杀的时候
Okay, did you think no one would bat an eye

299
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,060
没人会被调查吗
When a government witness was murdered?

300
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:52,090
我告诉过你我改变主意了
I told you I changed my mind.

301
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:54,060
我没有转账
I didn't transfer the funds.

302
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:56,046
你让我联系的那个人说
The man you put me in touch with said

303
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,026
不收到钱他不会动手
He wouldn't act until he received payment.

304
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,010
如果没人给他酬劳
Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges

305
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:01,040
他为什么还是下手干掉了霍奇斯呢
If he wasn't paid?

306
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,090
因为是我给他下的令
Because I told him to.

307
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,063
什么
What?

308
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,063
他打电话给我说
He called me and told me

309
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,090
钱还没到账
The money hadn't come through yet.

310
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:10,006
我告诉他你是懂规矩的  让他下手
I told him you were good for it and to proceed.

311
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,076
为什么  马丁  为什么这么做
Why, Martin? why would you do that?

312
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,086
霍奇斯马上就要进入证人保护计划
Hodges was going into Witness Protection,

313
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,030
这是最后下手的机会
There was a finite window of opportunity.

314
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,003
况且这正合你意啊
And because it's what you wanted.

315
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,040
对吧
Right?

316
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,070
尽管我再三警告你要三思
Despite all my warnings for you to reconsider,

317
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:23,020
你还是直视着我的眼睛
You looked me straight in the eye

318
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,090
告诉我你要霍奇斯死  非死不可
And you said you wanted Hodges dead, to make it happen.

319
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,093
我按你的意思做了  现在你梦想成真了
And I did, and he's dead.

320
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,030
天哪
Oh, my god...

321
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,080
可我的通话记录
But my phone records...

322
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,063
-电脑使用记录全都没清除   - 别操心
- M-my computer... everything...   - Don't worry about any of those.

323
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:40,036
我会给你传个程序  删除网页使用痕迹
I'll send you a program to erase your internet tracks.

324
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,066
你给我打的电话不会引起怀疑
The calls to me mean nothing.

325
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,083
奥利维亚  在你付诸行动之后
Olivia, the time to worry about your conscience

326
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:48,090
就没有良心谴责的后悔药可吃了
Was before you put this in motion.

327
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:50,076
如果你让这种不安控制了你
If you let this eat away at you,

328
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,010
别人就会注意到你的反常  并产生怀疑
People are going to notice and get suspicious.

329
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,083
你会把我们两个都拖下水
You will bring us both down...

330
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:58,063
还会殃及到你的母亲和她的政府
Destroy your mother and her administration.

331
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:02,013
想清楚  这是你想要的结果吗
Think about it. Is that what you want?

332
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,056
不是
No.

333
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,036
好  那就振作精神
Okay, then pull yourself together.

334
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,036
我答应你  你要是照我的话做
I promise you, this will all pass

335
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,010
我们都会相安无事
If you do what I say.

336
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,063
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

337
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,063
说
Say it.

338
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,026
我能做到
I can do it.

339
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:24,060
奥利维亚  你得先把钱汇过去
You need to transfer the funds, Olivia.

340
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,080
别让这个家伙对你不满
You do not want this man unhappy with you.

341
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,060
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

342
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:41,093
抱歉把你吵醒了
Sorry I woke you.

343
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:43,023
不不不  没关系
No, no, no, that's okay.

344
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,036
我被泰莉吵醒好多回了
I've been up with Teri a couple times anyway.

345
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,020
她一晚上都不得安宁
She's been having a rough night.

346
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:48,066
她应该是想妈妈了
I think she misses her mother.

347
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,046
听着
Oh, well, listen,

348
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,020
我打电话来是告诉你我的航班晚点了
I just called to let you know that my flight's been delayed.

349
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:54,076
好  晚了多久
Yeah, how long?

350
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,086
机场人员说是一个小时
Well, they're saying an hour.

351
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,020
实际可能晚点两个小时
Which probably means two.

352
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:59,063
好
Okay.

353
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,076
怎么了
What?

354
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,016
不知道  也许你该把这视为一种天意
I don't know, maybe you should see this as a sign.

355
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,053
天意
A sign?

356
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,053
暗示你该留在那里  努力说服你父亲
That you should stay there-- try to convince your father

357
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:09,046
就算他时日不多
That, uh, he should be spending whatever time

358
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,016
他也该和他的独生女一起度过
He has left with his only daughter.

359
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,040
尽管我很想陪他
As much as I want to,

360
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:15,016
他还是把话说得很清楚
He made it very clear

361
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,060
他不想让我陪在他身边看他死去
That he does not want me around to watch him die.

362
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:19,090
好吧
Okay, all right.

363
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:21,023
抱歉我谈起了令你不快的话题
Sorry I brought it up.

364
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:23,060
我和泰莉会去机场接你
Teri and I will be at the airport to pick you up.

365
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,023
我手机电量不足了
My battery is dying.

366
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:30,016
医院那边没意见吗
Is the hospital okay with that?

367
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,023
没  我和凯文谈过了
Yeah, I talked to Kevin.

368
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:32,050
他说会找人替我
He said he'd cover my rounds.

369
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,063
那真是  太好了
Well, that's-that's... that's great.

370
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,033
我等不及要见到你们了
Well, I can't wait to see you guys.

371
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,033
我爱你
I love you.

372
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,036
好  再见
Okay, bye.

373
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:43,086
莎拉  登机证呢
Sara, where are the boarding passes?

374
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,093
我看到你放进大衣口袋了  亲爱的
I saw you put them in your coat, honey.

375
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:47,006
抱歉  对不起
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

376
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,033
-没事  -抱歉
- That's all right. -Sorry.

377
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,053
没事吧
Everything okay?

378
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:51,083
没事  抱歉
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

379
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,066
L大街站到了
This stop, L  street.

380
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,043
L大街站到了
This stop, L street.

381
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:49,003
下一站  华盛顿中心
Next stop is Washington Center.

382
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:55,026
下一站是终点站  华盛顿中心
Next stop is the last. Next stop is Washington center.

383
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,093
炸弹已经安放好
The package is in place.

384
00:18:57,096 --> 00:19:00,053
释放装置既定扩散时间是
The dispersal mechanism is set to go off while

385
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,033
列车在华盛顿中心靠站时
The train is stopped at washington center.

386
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:03,070
好  我们在路上了
Good, we're on the move.

387
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:05,086
我们会在22大街接你
I'll pick you up at 22nd.

388
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,096
杰克  我破解了托尼的定位数据
Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data.

389
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,070
他在哪里  离这里三个街区
Where is he? Three blocks

390
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,070
马上就到22大街山你所在位置的南侧
Immediately south of your position on 22nd.

391
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,060
具体位置呢
Where exactly on 22nd?

392
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:25,096
就在你即将到达的街区西侧
West side of the block you're coming up on.

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,033
前方900英尺
900 feet ahead of you...

394
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:30,003
还有800英尺
800 feet...

395
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:33,096
所有小队  从南侧集结  准备行动
All teams, bring your units up from the south and prepare to move in.

396
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,023
好  我们看到他了
Okay, we've got him.

397
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,080
疑犯在一辆黑色货车里
Suspect is in a black van.

398
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,050
我们不能让这次行动演变为追捕行动
We can't let this turn into a pursuit.

399
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,060
坐稳
Hold on.

400
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,066
坐稳
Hold on!

401
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,050
准备好了吗
Ready?

402
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,010
我抓到托尼的时候
Tony was trying to destroy

403
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:06,056
他正试图摧毁某种装置
Some kind of device when I grabbed him!

404
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,053
找到了
I got it!

405
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:14,080
把这垃圾押起来
Lock down this piece of crap.

406
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:17,053
什么装置
What do you got?

407
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:19,073
一种移动电脑  但几乎全被他破坏了
Some kind of mobile computer, but he damaged it pretty badly.

408
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:21,070
这电脑和这次恐怖袭击一定有关
This has got something to do with the attack.

409
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:23,006
联系克罗伊  看有什么发现
Contact Chloe, see what we can find.

410
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,060
我要搜查这辆货车   看有没有毒气罐
I'm gonna sweep the van for the canister.

411
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:49,000
托尼的超便携移动电脑已经全部损坏
Tony's UMPC device is damaged everywhere I look.

412
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:51,080
没有方法可以恢复原样  并正常运行
I don't think there's a way to get it back up and running.

413
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,020
那就试试恢复部分数据

Anything that can help us find out what Tony's been up to.

427
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:26,066
-没有文件头就不行  -真的吗

-杰克  -没事没事
- Jack...  - It's all right, it's all right.

550
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:06,011
你该打一针了
You need to give yourself a shot.

551
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:08,081
20分钟前打过了  没用
I already did, 20 minutes ago. It's not working.

552
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:11,041
没事了  没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

553
00:29:11,044 --> 00:29:13,078
我们阻止他们了
We stopped it.

554
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:19,001
你终于能休息了
You can finally rest.

555
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:48,034
能给我一张看看吗
Can I have a piece of paper?

556
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:50,094
当然  这都给你吧
Yeah, sure, you can have all this.

557
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:53,001
那是什么
What's that?

558
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:55,008
是第一块版面  我只想要这部分
This is section "a"; it's the only thing I want.

559
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:57,048
我一看完就给你
I'll give it to you as soon as I'm done.

560
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,098
抱歉  介意我坐下来吗
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?

561
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:10,068
当然不介意
No, of course not.

562
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,014
你是回家吗
You heading home?

563
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,074
我们也是
Us, too.

我们住在格伦代尔

我老公的父母住那

567
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:23,008
你知道普鲁斯尔斯吗
You know the Pelusos?

568
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:25,054
不知道
I don't think so.

569
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:28,064
能帮我个忙吗
Do you mind doing me a favor?

570
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:29,068
好
Sure.

571
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:32,061
你看到在我们后面那桌的男人吗

他穿着西装
He's wearing a suit.

573
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:38,018
黑色短发
Uh, short, dark hair?

574
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:42,014
他盯着这里看吗
Yes, is he staring over here?

575
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,091
你认识他吗
You know him?

576
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,018
没有  只是之前他盯着我看
No, it's just that he was staring at me earlier.

577
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:48,054
你这么漂亮
Well, you're very pretty.

578
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:55,018
-怎么了  -他走了
- What?  - No, he's moving away now.

579
00:30:58,088 --> 00:30:59,081
她在我视线范围内
I've got her in sight.

580
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:01,048
她已经在登机口了
She's waiting at the gate now.

581
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:03,028
他们应该在一小时内登机

582
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:04,094
我知道生化武器的威胁已经解除了
Okay, look, I know that the bioweapons threat is over,

583
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:06,064
但如果你能看着她登机
But I'd feel a lot better if you'd watch over her

584
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:08,008
我会感觉好些
Until she gets on that plane.

585
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:10,086
是  长官  她上飞机了我会通知你的
Yes, sir, I'll let you know when she's in the air.

586
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,020
谢谢
Thanks.

587
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:13,090
我需要你和局办公室联系下

588
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:15,051
告诉他们  我们需要全套审问设备

589
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:16,060
我们回去前要准备好

590
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,006
- 是  长官  - 谢谢

591
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,026
杰克?
Jack?

592
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,038
我刚得到消息
I just got word.

593
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,005
乔纳斯·霍奇斯死于汽车炸弹
Jonas Hodges was killed with a car bomb

594
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:30,005
事发不到一小时
Less than an hour ago.

595
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:31,058
什么  怎么搞的
What? how?

596
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:33,048
我们还没什么线索  但可以肯定的是
We don't have any leads yet, but obviously somehow

597
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:36,058
他那一伙人发现他还活着
The people he was working for found out he was still alive.

598
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,038
也就是说他们也不会放过托尼
That means they're going to be coming after Tony.

599
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,061
我们需要护送他
We need to transport him in a convoy--

600
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,095
动用全部安保武装力量
Full guard detail, weapons ready.

601
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:44,068
不能再让他遭暗杀了
We're not losing him again. okay.

602
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:54,028
联邦调查局锁定了阿尔扎利安的位置
The FBI located Al-zarian.

603
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:55,068
我们无能为力了
There was nothing we could do.

604
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:58,005
你是说我们丧失了那个毒气罐
You're telling me the canister is gone.

605
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,088
该死
Damn it!

606
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:07,028
没有那个病原体
Without that pathogen,

607
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:09,078
我们将前功尽弃
Everything that we've worked for is finished.

608
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:11,095
你要清楚  托尼被调查局逮捕了
You should also know the FBI has Tony.

609
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,031
那你就该做了他
Then you need to have him eliminated.

610
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:16,018
-艾伦  -他知道的太多了  卡拉
- Alan. - He knows too much, Cara.

611
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,078
他要是招供出来  我们就玩完了
We can't take the risk that he'll break.

612
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:19,041
你得把他干掉
You need to take him out.

613
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:22,075
我跟你讲  那根本没必要
I'm trying to tell you that won't be necessary.

614
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:25,038
托尼不会被长时间关押
Tony won't be in custody for long.

615
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,048
你说什么
What are you talking about?

616
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:28,001
相信我
Trust me.

617
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:29,098
我们另有妙计
We've got another play.

618
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:33,041
别蒙我
You'd better have.

619
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,015
从波士顿起飞的航班马上就降落了
The incoming flight from Boston will be arriving shortly.

620
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:42,021
乘客下飞机之后
Once the passengers have deplaned

621
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:43,098
机场地勤人员会立刻
And the maintenance crew is given a chance

622
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:45,005
对飞机进行维护和清理
To clean up the aircraft,

623
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:46,081
之后我们方可登机
We should be able to begin boarding.

624
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:48,068
感谢您的耐心配合  谢谢
We appreciate your patience. Thank you.

625
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:51,055
至少  我们知道飞机在半路上了
Well, at least we know the plane's on its way.

626
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:54,025
眼见为实  耳听为虚
I'll believe that when I see it.

627
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:55,091
我去弄点咖啡
Well, I'm gonna get some coffee.

628
00:32:55,091 --> 00:32:57,034
你们需要什么吗
Does anybody want anything?

629
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,025
我要杯低咖啡因咖啡
I'll take a decaf.

630
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,038
什么都不需要  谢谢
Nothing for me, thanks.

631
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,088
你确定吗  我请客
Oh, come on. Are you sure? It's my treat.

632
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:04,025
的确不需要什么  谢谢
No, no, thank you.

633
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:06,055
好吧
All right.

634
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:10,001
你老公真是新好男人
Your husband's really nice.

635
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:11,061
对  他也有对人殷勤的时候
Hmm, he has his moments.

636
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:15,031
抱歉  我想去一下洗手间
You know what? I'm, I'm gonna use the restroom.

637
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,075
-不介意帮我看一下包吧  -没问题

我知道你为我的失态而担忧

But as I told you, it won't happen again.

645
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:06,067
女士  不会的
No, ma'am, it won't...

646
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,093
不然你就得找别人干这份工作了
Or you'll need to find someone else to do this job.

647
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:13,030
亚伦  那没必要
Aaron, that won't be necessary.

648
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,080
女士  你说你离开了办公室
Ma'am, you said you left the grounds

649
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:17,023
去办了件私事
To run a personal errand.

650
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,083
怒我冒昧  您办啥去了
May I ask what it was?

651
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,049
我只是想独自出去
I just needed to get out of here,

652
00:35:27,032 --> 00:35:29,090
清醒下头脑
be alone, clear my head,

653
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:32,084
一会儿就行
If only for a short time.

654
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:38,047
今天发生的一切  被劫持为人质
Everything that's happened today-- being held hostage,

655
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,037
乔纳斯·霍奇斯被谋杀

656
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,037
目睹我虚弱的父亲
And seeing my father so weak and vulnerable...

657
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:54,017
我快崩溃了
I was feeling overwhelmed.

658
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,010
亚伦  我努力着不辜负我母亲的期望
Aaron, I'm trying to live up to my mother's expectations.

659
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,080
我不希望她
And I didn't want her--

660
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:05,004
或是相关的任何人
Or anyone else for that matter--

661
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:07,077
发现我已不堪重负
To know I was being affected by the pressure.

662
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,040
希望你能理解

663
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:18,030

确实好点了
I am, actually.

666
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,092
我觉得需要有个人能倾听我的心事
I guess I just needed to tell someone what was going on with me.

667
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:33,051
很高兴你就是那个我信任的人
I'm glad it was someone I could trust.

668
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:36,025
您过奖了  女士

674
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:11,088
长官  我是皮尔斯探员

675
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,045
希望没打扰您休息

676
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:15,098
没  皮尔斯探员  我没休息

677

我能帮你什么
What can I do for you?

678
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:19,031
卡宁先生  几年前
Mr. Kanin, some years ago,

679
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:22,095
当我在帕默尔总统身边当保镖时
While I served on president Palmer's detail,

680
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:27,035
我注意到了一些参谋长办公室规程的变更
I was made aware of some modifications made to the chief of staff's office.

681
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:29,045
你的意思是在迈克·诺威克的任期中
You mean, during Mike Novick's tenure.

682
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:34,041
是的  长官  尤其是录音监听系统
Yes, sir, specifically the installation of a voice-activated recording system.

683
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,081
使得联席会议会被录音存档
It allows staff meetings to be logged and archived.

684
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:40,025
如果你问我是否使用了这套设备
If you're asking whether I used the recording equipment,

685
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:41,068
回答是  是的我用了
The answer's yes.

686
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:45,011
长官  当你辞职并离开办公室的时候
Sir, did you disconnect it when you resigned

687
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,018
你关闭了装置吗
And left your office?

688
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,021
没有  怎么了
No. why you asking?

689
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:50,042
我请求现在暂不回答
I'd prefer not to answer that at this time.

690
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:53,025
我想知道如何进入数码录音设备
I need to know how to access the digital recorder.

691
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:56,095
你进不去的  有生物识别锁
You can't. it's secured with a biometric lock.

692
00:37:56,098 --> 00:37:58,002
你需要我的指纹
You need my thumbprint.

693
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:00,055
亚伦  如果你需要我的帮助
Look, Aaron, if you want my help,

694
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:03,068
你就先告诉我这是怎么回事
You're gonna have to tell me what this is about.

695
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:07,002
奥利维亚·泰勒还在使用我的办公室
Olivia Taylor's still using my office.

696
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:10,032
这和她有什么直接联系吗
Does this have to do with her?

697
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:13,018
电话里我真的没法讲清楚
I really can't talk about this over the phone right now.

698
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:17,042
我半小时之内到白宫来
I'll be at the White House within a half hour.

699
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,028
谢谢长官
Thank you, sir.

700
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:52,036
你不觉得你有些事需要和我说说吗
Do you have something you'd like to say to me?

701
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:53,075
什么事情
Like what?

702
00:38:53,075 --> 00:38:54,075
我觉得你自己心知肚明
Oh, I think you know.

703
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:56,005
我不知道
I don't think I do.

704
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,087
不如对我说  "干得好  詹尼斯
How about "good job, Janice,

705
00:38:57,087 --> 00:39:00,038
超便携电脑修复得很好"
on reconstructing the UMPC"?

706
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:01,098
或者说  "也许我早该想到
Or "just maybe I should have considered the possibility

707
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,038
你确有两把刷子的可能性"
That you actually know what you're doing."

708
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,008
你不了解我
Oh, you don't know me,

709
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,088
如果你了解了  你就会明白
But if you did, you would understand

710
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:09,055
那是你最后才需要确认的地方
That this is the last place you should look for any type of validation.

711
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:11,048
你怎么就死不认错呢
How about just acknowledging you were wrong?!

712
00:39:16,095 --> 00:39:18,008
我们准备好出发了
We're almost ready to go.

713
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:20,008
好  是她吗
Okay. is this her?

714
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:24,005
是她  但我在首府警局看到她时
Uh, yes, but when I saw her in the Metro,

715
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:28,012
她戴着黑色假发  穿了件皮衣
she had on this dark wig and a leather jacket.

716
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:30,092
吉布安  你弟弟到了
Jibraan, your brother's here.

717

Let's pack up.

719
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,062
哈米德
Hamid!

720
00:39:58,012 --> 00:40:01,018
那边那个卖咖啡的地方  借过
Well, the coffee place over here-- excuse me--

721
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:02,062
没有低咖啡因咖啡
Didn't have decaf,

722
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:06,018
所以我一直走到那边尽头去了
So I had to go all the way to the other end of the terminal,

723
00:40:06,022 --> 00:40:10,028
总之搞到了
But I want you to know I got it.

724
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,045
谢谢
Thank you.

725
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:33,068

我正把链接发到你手机上
I'm sending a link to your phone.

727
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:36,098
有样东西你需要看一看
It's something I think you should see.

728

729
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:42,022
打开链接  鲍尔先生
Open the link, Mr. Bauer.

730
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,088
你他妈的是何方神圣
Who the hell is this?

731
00:40:51,092 --> 00:40:53,064
你女儿正在我们的控制之中
Your daughter's in the company of our operatives.

732
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:56,022
弗兰克斯探员已经上西天了
And agent franks has already been neutralized.

733
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:57,072
你得帮助托尼·阿尔梅达脱身
You will help Tony Almeida escape

734
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:59,075
不然我的人会杀了你女儿

735
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:03,012
如果你想联系她或者告诉任何人
Any effort to contact her or warn anybody about this

736
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:05,065
后果是一样的  明白吗
Will have the same result, do you understand?

737
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:07,085
我做不到你的要求
What you're asking me to do is impossible.

738
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,070
托尼·阿尔梅达已经被看起来了
Tony Almeida's already been secured.

739
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,070
被严密监视着
He's under heavy guard.

740
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,002
那是你的问题
Well, that's your problem.

741
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:13,092
把这条线连到你耳机上
Put this call on your earpiece

742

让它一直开着

743
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,009
我要监听你说的每句话
I'm gonna be listening to everything you say.

744
00:41:17,012 --> 00:41:19,035
马上行动  鲍尔
Now, Bauer.

745
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:41,042
你将会为杀害拉里受到应有的惩罚
You're gonna pay for what you did to Larry.

746
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:47,042
我以为你会跟着莫伦
I thought you were going with moran.

747
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:50,009
我改了主意
Changed my mind.

748
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,025
我想跟到底
I wanna see this through.

749
00:41:58,045 --> 00:42:01,022
你要尽快把阿尔梅达救出来

I'm gonna tell you what to do and when to do it.

751

还有  鲍尔先生
Oh, and mr. Bauer,

752
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,005
如果有其它的探员挡道的话
If any of those agents in that van get in the way,

753
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:13,029
你要么让他们死  要么让你女儿死
You will have to eliminate them, or your daughter will die.
