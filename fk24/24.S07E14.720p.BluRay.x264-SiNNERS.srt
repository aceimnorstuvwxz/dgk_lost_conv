《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,073
我们得牵制他并设法救出总统
We need to pick him off to try to save the president.

5
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:19,037
我跑到安全屋那儿
I'll make a run for the lockdown room.

6
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:21,054
那儿有5个装有甲烷的罐子
There are five canisters of ch-4.

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,054
只要一个流弹就够了
All we need is one stray bullet.

8
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:25,057
那等于自杀  杰克
A suicide play,jack.

9
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:27,014
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

10
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:34,015
别动
Don't you move!

11
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,048
我们找到总统了
We have the president!

12
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:37,075
总统安全了
The president is secure!

13
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:39,012
我很遗憾  杰克
I'm so sorry,jack.

14
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:40,072
我知道他是你的好朋友
I know that he was your friend.

15
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:42,012
牺牲的本该是我
It was supposed to be me.

16
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:44,023
朱玛一伙还有同党
Juma and his men were not working alone.

17
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:45,099
现在唯一的线索就是莱恩·伯内特
And right now,the only lead we've got is ryan burnett.

18
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:47,080
他知道这次袭击的目标是白宫
He knew about the attack on the white house,

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,080
他很有可能知道  朱玛和谁通话
And chances are,he's gonna know who juma was talking to.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,023
我正在考虑
I'm thinking about

21
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:53,084
让奥利维亚加入
Bringing olivia on  board

22
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:56,094
担任特别顾问
As a special advisor.

23
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,071
大选时她的所为大家都还历历在目
Nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign.

24
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,061
她对媒体散布谣言
Leaking damaging personal information

25
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,018
诽谤您的竞选对手
About your opponent to the press.

26
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:03,068
她已痛改前非
She's changed.

27
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:05,045
我不计较过去
It's not the past that concerns me.

28
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,068
但如果我妈的政府里有个
Do you think any of this

29
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:08,075
称职的首席顾问  你觉得
Would've happened if my mother had a chief advisor

30
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:11,002
今天的一切还会发生吗
Who knew what the hell was going on in her administration?

31
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:13,015
我刚接到伊桑·卡宁的电话
I just got off the phone with ethan kanin.

32
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:16,019
他命令我让鲍尔去审问伯内特
He's ordering me to let bauer interrogate burnett.

33
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,006
听着  我不想背着你做事
Look,i didn't want to go behind your back,

34
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:19,053
但是你让我别无选择
But you didn't leave me any choice.

35
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:21,003
你给我回办公室收拾铺盖卷儿
I want you to clean out your office

36
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,043
并上交你的联邦探员徽章
And hand in your badge.

37
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:23,073
你被停职了
I'm suspending you.

38
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:26,097
杰克·鲍尔正在去肯尼迪纪念医院的路上
Jack bauer's on his way to kennedy memorial hospital.

39
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:28,094
伯内特一定会和盘托出
Burnett will tell him everything.

40
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:30,057
我已派人去医院
I have already sent somebody to the hospital

41
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,097
干掉伯内特
To deal with burnett.

42
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,034
他也会好好招呼鲍尔的
He can take care of bauer at the same time.

43
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:35,098
你动他一根汗毛  就别想再继续了
You lay one finger on him,it's over.

44
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:38,065
明白
Right.

45
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,048
朱玛已经玩完儿了
Juma's attack failed.

46
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:42,042
他跟他的同党都死翘翘了
He's dead,so are his men.

47
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,005
来人啊  救我
Somebody get me the hell out of here!

48
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,049
你哪也去不成了
You're not going anywhere.

49
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,062
怎么了
What happened?

50
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:48,086
出什么事了
What's going on?

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
该死  鲍尔  给我开门
Damn it,bauer,open the door!

52
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:05,001
优先发布捉拿杰克·鲍尔的全境缉捕通告
I want a high-priority APB issued for jack bauer.

53
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,024
拉里  我是杰克  听我说
Larry,it's jack. listen to me.

54
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:07,058
我是被陷害的
I'm being set up.

55
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:09,008
别让他们逍遥法外
Don't let them get away with this.

56
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,005
这次威胁还没有结束
This threat is not over.

57
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:17,041
以下事件发生于晚上9点到10点
The following takes place between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.

58
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:16,021
5个小时前我开车送我妻子到这
I dropped my wife off here five hours ago,

59
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,045
现在却不知所踪
And now no one can tell me where she is.

60
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:20,008
奥布赖恩先生  白宫遭到了恐怖袭击
Mr. o'brian,the white house has been attacked.

61

她在三楼的关押室

68
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:32,096
-什么  -她被逮捕了
- What...? - she's been arrested.

69
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:34,083
太荒唐了
That's absurd.

70
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,083
凭什么抓她  我要见她

参与到这场阴谋当中

为了掩盖罪行

I got a frame grab from the hospital's surveillance.

140
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,063
我把杀害伯内特的凶手照片发给你

141
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:20,026
在你的收件箱里
It's in your inbox.

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,047
蕾妮  此人是能帮我们找出这次事件
Renee,this man is the only connection i have to whoever else

143
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,080
幕后指使的唯一线索

求你了  我需要你的帮助

145
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,091
我知道你对我今天的行事方式有意见
Look, i know you don't agree with some of thing i did today.

146
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:37,018
但是我跟你说的是事实
But... i'm telling you the truth.

147
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,045
蕾妮
Renee?

148
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:43,045
你知道吗
You know what?

149
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:44,062
算了  抱歉
Forget it. i'm-i'm sorry.

150
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,069
我找错人了
I made a mistake.

151
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:47,075
我一会打给你
I'll call you back at this number.

152
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:54,093
首府警察
Metro police,

153
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:56,030
这里是联邦调查局的通告
This is the fbi reporting.

We have a suspect,jack bauer,that's escaped custody.

155

所有小队  收到请回答
All available units,please respond.

156
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,071
奎恩  请讲
Yes,quinn.

157
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,061
鲍尔从联邦调查局跑了
Bauer got away from the fbi.

158
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,065
怎么回事
How?

159
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,015
鲍尔是名身手不凡的探员
Well,bauer is an extremely impressive operative.

160
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:17,089
这点不用你来提醒我
You don't have to tell me that.

161
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:20,079
联邦调查局正在全力抓捕他
But the fbi has launched a major effort to apprehend him.

162
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,006
他撑不了多久的
He won't be able to avoid them for long.

163
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,023
静观其变吧
Well,we'll see,won't we?

164
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,069
继续追踪情况  及时反馈
Monitor the situation,keep me apprised.

165
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:28,016
是的  先生
Yes,sir.

166
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:32,020
如果鲍尔把我们和朱玛联系上
If bauer connects us to juma,

167
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,035
会严重阻碍这次行动
It could seriously impede this operation.

168
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,084
没错
Yes,it could.

169
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,047
货能准时送到吗
Is the shipment on time?

170
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:42,004
是的  一个小时后到港
Yes. due into port in the next hour.

171
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,031
那就没问题了
Then I don't foresee a problem.

172
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,085
一旦武器部署到位
Once the weapons are deployed,

173
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:48,048
鲍尔和其他人知道与否就无关紧要了
Then it doesn't matter what mr. bauer or anyone else knows.

174
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,042
还有问题吗
Something wrong?

175
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,002
没有了  先生
No,sir.

176
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:59,003
西顿先生  想到这么多人会命丧我手
Mr. seaton,I get no pleasure

177
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:03,083
我也深感内疚和痛苦
From the knowledge that people will die at our hands.

178
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:07,087
死去的每一个人  对我来说都是一场悲剧
One single soul,the loss of one soul is tragic to me,

179
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,027
更别说是这么大的一个伤亡数字
Let alone the numbers we're talking about!

180
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:12,031
但你不要忘了
But do not forget that every war

181
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,054
任何战争都会有附带伤亡的
Worth fighting involves collateral damage.

182
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:16,034
而且我们现在做的事
And what we're doing

183
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,075
从根本意义上来说是绝对必要的
Is fundamentally and absolutely necessary!

184
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,075
我希望你清楚这点
And I know you understand that!

185
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,045
当然
Of course.

186
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:33,006
叫醒同事们
Wake up our colleagues

187
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:35,003
让他们在一小时之内集合
And have them assembled in one hour.

188
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:38,000
告诉他们带上睡衣和牙刷
And tell them to pack their pajamas and their toothbrushes.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,057
今夜会很漫长
It's gonna be a long night.

190
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:54,028
请讲
Yeah?

191
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:55,072
-查到了  -是谁

在世界各地都执行过任务

195
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,032
现在他在斯塔克伍德公司供职
Now he works for starkwood.

196
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:02,069
国防部的顾问公司吗
The defense consultant?

197
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,013
是的  他们开始只是搞咨询服务
Uh,yeah,they started out as consultants,

198
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:06,003
但在过去你身处异国他乡的几年里
But over the past few years,while you were

199
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,063
五角大楼外包了许多

200
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,066
亿万美元的合同给他们
Billions of dollars in contracts to them.

201
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,067
什么样的合同
What kind of contracts?

202
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,010
人力资源输出
Manpower.

203
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,073
斯塔克伍德公司本质上就是一支私人军队
Starkwood's basically a private army.

204
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,044
他们从世界各地
They recruit ex-soldiers and swat team members

205
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:16,094
招募了许多退役士兵和反恐特警
From around the world,

206
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:19,011
雇佣他们组成军事安保小组
Then they hire them back to the military security teams.

207
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:21,098
成千上万的特警驻扎在国内外
We're talking thousands of men deployed here and abroad.

208
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:23,031
斯塔克伍德和朱玛是一伙的吗
Starkwood work with juma?

209
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:25,031
即使是  也根本无案可查
Well,if they did,it wasn't on the books.

210
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,035
但若有人知情  就一定是迈尔参议员
But,you know,if anyone knows,it's senator mayer.

211
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,079
为什么是他
Why mayer?

212
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,022
解散了反恐小组之后
After he dismantled ctu,

213
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,052
他又开始了一系列的调查
He launched several other investigations.

214
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,019
斯塔克伍德公司也在其中
One of them has been looking at starkwood.

215
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,072
指控的罪名是什么
What were they accused of?

216
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,013
听证会是保密的
The hearings are classified,but

217
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:41,010
但想必迈尔该有足够的证据搞垮他们
Supposedly,mayer has enough to put them out of business.

218
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,073
好的  我现在就去找他谈
Okay,i'm gonna need to talk to him.

219
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:44,082
能否查下紧急事件反应小组的记录
See if you can access the CIRG logs.

220
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:45,093
应该可以找到他的位置
They should have a location on him.

221
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:48,097
好的  我找到之后马上发给你

但有个人在会议室

你知道发生在医院的事了吗
You hear what happened at the hospital?

233
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:32,031
杰克今天为我们做了这么多
After everything that jack's done today,

234
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,028
你真的相信他杀了伯内特吗
Do you really believe that he murdered Burnett?

235
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,032
我不知道
I don't know.

236

我  我不在乎
I... I don't care.

他是联邦政府逃犯  必须抓他归案
He's a federal fugitive and needs to be found.

238
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:43,063
但你觉得有可能是他杀的吗
But you think it's possible that he did this?

239
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:46,096
因为我不太能相信这点

但我认为您错失了一个良机
But I think you're missing an opportunity here.

272
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:25,086
是做什么的良机呢
To do what?

273
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:27,060
宣布胜利
Claim victory.

00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:34,000
而您出兵桑加拉的决定是正确的
and that your decision to send troops into sangala was the right one.

277
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,094
我认为现在并不是
I'm not sure that this is

278
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:38,001
欢呼雀跃的恰当时机  利维
The appropriate time to sound triumphant,livy.

279
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,047
今天很多人失去了生命
A lot of lives were lost today.

280
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:43,058
您对亡灵的追悼  将令他们死得其所
And by addressing those deaths,you give them meaning.

281
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:45,045
那些人是英雄豪杰
Those people are heroes

282
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,018
他们为正义的战争而牺牲
Who died in a war that was worth fighting.

283
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:51,042
好吧  我会加上去的
Let's work it in.

284
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:58,066
请进
Come in.

285
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,073
总统阁下  我有个坏消息
Madam president,i have some troubling news.

286
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:06,053
可以和您单独谈谈吗
May i speak with you alone?

287
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,094
你可以在奥利维亚面前直说
You my speak freely in front of olivia.

288
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,081
在白宫遇袭之后
Just after the attack on the white house,

289
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,024
杰克·鲍尔提供了
Jack bauer came forward

290
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:18,085
一个令人堪忧的情报
With a disturbing claim.

291
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:20,055
他说还有一些涉案人员
He said there were people

292
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:23,042
仍然逍遥法外
Still at large who were involved in the conspiracy--

293
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:26,002
正是这些不知名的家伙帮助朱玛
Persons unknown who had helped juma

294
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:27,086
策划并实施了这次袭击
Plan and execute the attacks.

295
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:30,026
鲍尔有证据吗
Did bauer have any evidence of this?

296
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,086
没有确凿的证据
Nothing concrete.

297
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:34,039
但他认为莱恩·伯内特
But he promoted the notion that ryan burnett

298
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,096
是我们找出这些人的最佳机会
Was our best chance of identifying these people,

299
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:39,080
鲍尔要求我授权去审讯他
And bauer asked to be allowed to question him.

300
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,090
情况本该在掌控之中
This was supposed to be a controlled situation.

301
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,057
本打算设计让他威胁伯内特如实招供
A ploy to intimidate burnett into giving up intel.

302
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:53,031
所以我同意了鲍尔的请求
So,I granted bauer's request.

303
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:56,045
但我铸成了大错
It was a terrible mistake.

304
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,079
伊桑  发生什么事了
What happened,ethan?

305
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,049
伯内特死了
Burnett is dead.

306
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,026
天哪
My god...

307
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:06,026
证据表明  他是被鲍尔所杀
The evidence suggests that he was killed by bauer.

308
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,006
我不相信
I don't believe it!

309
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:11,016
他声称参与这次阴谋的另有其人
His claim of another party being involved in the attacks

310
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,017
这话看起来是一个谎言
Appear to have been a fabrication.

311
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:14,057
谎言
A fabrication.

312
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:17,014
这可能与比尔·布坎南的死有关
It may have something to do with bill buchanan's death;

313
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:18,047
没人知道
No one knows.

314
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:20,084
但是总统阁下
But madam president,

315
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,024
我将对我的行为承担全部责任
I take full responsibility.

316
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:24,039
我试图不告诉您是因为
I was trying to insulate you.

317
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,098
万一出了岔子  您可以推诿说不知情
To provide you with deniability in case anything went wrong.

318
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:30,052
或是因为你认为总统会反对你的做法吧
Or was it because you thought the president would say no?

319
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,062
奥利维亚
Olivia.

320
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,086
鲍尔现在在哪里
Where is bauer now?

321
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:38,039
依旧在逃
At large.

322
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,043
调查局正全力追捕他
The fbi is devoting its full resources to the manhunt.

323
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:44,036
一旦找到他  马上向我汇报
Let me know the minute they find him.

324
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:46,027
好的  阁下
Yes,ma'am.

325
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,087
总统阁下
Madam president...

326
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,064
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,029
看起来东西都齐了
Looks like everything.

328
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:18,083
她要走了
She's on the move.

329
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,041
鲍尔在哪里
Where's bauer?

330
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,064
我不知道
I don't know.

331
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:30,068
不要对我撒谎
Don't you lie to me.

332
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,038
我们追踪到你给一个
We traced two calls from your cell

333
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:33,088
挂失的手机打了两通电话
To a phone that was reported stolen.

334
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:36,085
我们也查出你进入了政府机密数据库
And we know you accessed a classified government database

335
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:39,052
还把某人的姓名和地址发给鲍尔
And sent someone's name and address to bauer.

336
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:42,072
蕾妮  这样一来你成了事后从犯了
Renee,that makes you an accessory after the fact.

337
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:44,093
告诉我他在哪
Now tell me where he is.

338
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,076
我做不到
I can't.

339
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,090
-该死  -我还是不信是他干的
- Damn it! - I still don't believe that he did this.

340
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,023
那解释下他为什么不自首
Then explain to me why he's not turning himself in,

341
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:54,050
让我们帮他找到那莫须有的第三方
And letting us help him find this mysterious third party.

342
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,007
因为他被陷害而且他不相信
Because he was framed and he doesn't trust

343
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,044
我们能为他洗脱罪名
Our ability to work through it.

344
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,031
在我们对他那般地不公后
And,you know,after what we've put him through,

345
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:00,034
我们怎能再责备他呢
How can you blame him?

346
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:05,031
你真愿为保全他而牺牲一切吗
You're actually willing to sacrifice everything to protect him.

347
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,008
杰克找到证据后  他会给我们打电话的
Once jack finds the evidence,he will call us.

348
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:13,059
詹尼斯在破译你发出的信息
You know,janis is decrpyting what you sent.

349
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,059
用不了多久
It's not going to take her a long time.

350
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,006
我们就会找到他的
We are going to find him.

351
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,076
蕾妮  告诉我你发的是谁的资料
Renee,tell me whose information you sent.

352
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:22,095
我会告诉司法部长  你很合作
I'll let the A.G. know that you're cooperating.

353
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:25,023
抱歉  拉里
I'm sorry,larry.

354
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:28,077
把她关起来
Put her in holding.

355
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:31,060
告知她所享有的合法权利
Mirandize her.

356
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,076
晚安  先生
Good night,sir.

357
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:55,039
明早见
See you in the morning.

358
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:46,078
有人吗
Hello?

359
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:54,069
把你的手放在我看得到的地方   参议员
Keep your hands where i can see them,senator.

360
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:56,049
鲍尔
Bauer.

361
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,072
坐下
Take a seat.

362
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,083
我知道你对莱恩·伯内特都做了什么
I know what you did to ryan burnett.

363
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,057
我不会让你那样杀了我的
I'm not going to let you butcher me like you did him.

364
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:10,084
你想我死的话  鲍尔
You want me dead,bauer,

365
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,047
那你就在这动手吧
You'll have to kill me where i stand.

366
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,094
参议员  如果我想杀你 你早就死了
If i wanted to kill you,senator, You'd be dead already.

367
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,074
给我坐下
Now take a seat!

368
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,026
你真让人费解  鲍尔
You're a real enigma,bauer.

369
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,036
在你把总统从恐怖分子魔掌中救出的1小时后
An hour after you save the president from terrorists,

370
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:34,086
你却残忍地杀害了一名联邦证人
You murder a federal witness in cold blood.

371
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,070
我没杀伯内特
I didn't kill burnett.

372
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,007
是他干的
This man did.

373
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,057
你知道他是谁吗
Do you know who he is?

374
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,067
不知道
No.

375
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,034
他叫约翰·奎恩
His name is john quinn.

376
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,084
他为斯塔克伍德公司卖命
He works for starkwood.

377
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:46,067
这和斯塔克伍德公司有什么联系
What in the world does starkwood have to do with this?

378
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:47,084
我还不清楚
I don't know yet.

379
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,086
但我知道他们派人杀了伯内特
But i do know they sent someone to kill burnett

380
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,026
并陷害我来掩盖他们
And frame me to cover up their involvement

381
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,077
今天所策划的一切阴谋诡计
In everything that's happened today,

382
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,061
包括这次对白宫的袭击
Including the attack on the white house.

383
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:58,042
鲍尔  这简直是天方夜谭
That's a hell of a theory,bauer.

384
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:00,079
但如果你妄想以此洗脱罪名的话
But you'll have to spin a better story than that

385
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,062
那你还得给我编个更好的故事吧
If you expect it to get you off the hook.

386
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:04,056
参议员  我不是来为自己证明清白的
Senator,i did not come here to clear my name.

387
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,039
我只想搞清楚
I'm trying to understand

388
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,056
朱玛和斯塔克伍德之间的联系
The connection between juma and starkwood.

389
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,073
没有任何联系
There isn't one.

390
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:16,070
我花了6个月的时间来调查斯塔克伍德
I've spent the better part of six months investigating starkwood.

391
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,066
如果和朱玛或桑加拉有关的话
If there was a connection to juma or sangala,

392
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,047
我早就知道了
I would know it.

393
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:22,078
我想看下你们所有相关的调查文件
I want to see every file you have concerning that investigation.

394
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,064
听着
Look...

395
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,068
斯塔克伍德公司纵容其安保队
Starkwood has let their security teams run amok

396
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:33,049
在全世界胡作非为  却坐视不管
All over the world,with no oversight.

397
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,012
他们试图以贿赂取得大项目的订单
They've bribed their way into large contracts,

398
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:38,027
他们试图干涉外交政策来为己所用
They've tried to influence foreign policy to their own benefit--

399
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:41,043
这就是为什么这个国家不该把军事行动
all good reasons Why this country should not be outsourcing

400
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:45,063
外包给私人企业的原因
Its military operations to private corporations.

401
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:49,067
我会让他们关门大吉的
And i am going to shut them down.

402
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:53,011
但没有任何证据表明
But there is nothing to remotely suggest

403
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:56,051
他们和本次针对祖国的恐怖袭击有牵连
They'd be involved in terrorist attacks on their own country

404
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:58,038
他们绝不会为钱出卖国家
For any amount of money.

405
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:00,095
他们帮助朱玛可能另有所图
Maybe they have different reasons for helping juma.

406
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,055
图什么
Like what?

407
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:04,005
我不知道
I don't know.

408
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,029
先生  我相信这个国家还会受到攻击
Sir,i believe this country is still under attack,

409
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,082
而这一切一定有一个合理的解释
And there has to be a reason.

410
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:11,092
难道我该相信一个绑架我的人的鬼话吗
And i'm supposed to believe this, coming from a man who's holding me hostage?

411
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,083
我要查看那些文件
I need access to those files.

412
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:22,030
如果朱玛和斯塔克伍德之间没有牵连
And if the connection Between juma and starkwood isn't there,

413
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,060
你愿意自首吗
Will you turn yourself in,then?

414
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:31,008
打开文件  先生
Just open the files,sir.

415
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:48,086
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

416
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:51,098
总统今晚会发表一个简短的讲话
The president will be making a brief statement tonight.

417
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:54,010
祝你好运  妈
Good luck,mom.

418
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:56,029
我相信你们会理解  基于今天发生的事件
I'm sure you'll understand, based on the events of today,

419
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,096
讲话后没有提问的环节
There will be no opportunity for follow-up questions.

420
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:02,033
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

421
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:05,061
总统阁下驾到
The president of the united states.

422
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:17,091
谢谢你们
Thank you very much.

423
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:19,075
谢谢
Thank you.

424
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:24,002
谢谢
Thank you.

425
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,082
亲爱的美国同胞们  约翰·亚当斯
My fellow americans,john adams,

426
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:33,016
第一位在白宫居住的总统
The first president to take up residence in the white house,

427
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,039
曾向上苍祈福
Once prayed for heaven to bestow

428
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
祈祷白宫永享太平
Its blessings on this place.

429
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,083
今晚  上天保佑  让我们从
Tonight,those blessings have seen us through

430
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:44,057
一群玩命之徒的袭击中化险为夷
A brutal attack by a desperate tyrant.

431
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:47,057
我们失去了朋友和所爱的人
We have lost friends and loved ones here,

432
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:50,027
但我们胜利了
But we have prevailed.

433
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:52,061
我已经命令执法机构
I have commanded law enforcement agencies,

434
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,071
突发事件处理部门及其反应小组
Emergency services and first responders

435
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:56,001
时刻准备着
To keep their deployment level...

436
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:57,035
卡宁先生  我是肯·德奥  CNB的记者
Mr. kanin,ken dellao,cnb.

437
00:21:57,036 --> 00:22:01,015
你能否确认下我刚收到的一条消息
I'm wondering if you can confirm some information I received a short time ago?

438
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:02,085
肯  现在真不是时候
Ken,this is clearly not the time...

439
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:06,039
我想在今晚的报道中播出
Yeah,i'm,i'm going to be reporting in this evening's broadcast

440
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,036
一名叫杰克·鲍尔的前联邦探员
That a rogue ex-federal agent named jack bauer

441
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:12,026
涉嫌谋杀了莱恩·伯内特
Is the prime suspect in the murder of ryan burnett.

442
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:15,003
...无法忘记今天的事件
...cannot forget today's events.

443
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:16,020
那些牺牲的生命...
The lives we lost...

444
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:17,050
你从哪听到的
Where did you get this?

445
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:19,044
这么说是真的了
So,it's true,then?

446
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:21,011
我没这么说
I'm not confirming anything.

447
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:24,061
我还会报道  是您授权释放了鲍尔
I'll also be reporting that you authorized bauer's release from custody

448
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:27,030
并安排他接近受害者
And arranged for his access to the victim.

449
00:22:28,062 --> 00:22:32,055
儿女们  兄弟姐妹们
...daughters and sons,brothers and sisters,

450
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,079
但他们夺不走我们的灵魂
But they have not taken our spirit.

451
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,062
没错  今天的袭击
Make no mistake,today's attacks

452
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:40,036
本来是企图摧毁我们的决心
Were intended to crush our resolve.

453
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:41,022
卡宁先生
Mr. kanin.

454
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:42,053
我说过  无可奉告
I said no comment.

455
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:45,030
但美国绝不会那么轻易屈服
But america is not so easily broken.

456
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:49,053
我们在桑加拉的军事行动已大获全胜
Our military action in sangala has been a success.

457
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:51,095
此时此刻  我们的部队
At this hour,our forces

458
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:54,007
已经控制了桑加拉
have taken control of sangala city.

459
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:56,031
我们赢了
We have won.

460
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:59,030
看来你又在耍老把戏了
I see you're back to your old tactics.

461
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:01,081
你把伯内特的死
You leaked the story of burnett's murder

462
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:03,035
还有我的介入都透露给了媒体
And my involvement to the press.

463
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:06,045
伊桑  我不知道你在说什么
Ethan,i don't know what you're talking about.

464
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:14,069
奥利维亚  别想抵赖了
Olivia,don't bother denying it.

465
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:19,010
知道我授权释放鲍尔的人屈指可数
I can count on one hand the number of people who knew i'd authorized bauer's release.

466
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:22,023
那么你的又一次判断失误
So another one of your errors in judgment

467
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:23,043
让你搬起石头砸了自己的脚
bites you on the ass.

468
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:26,097
你还妄想把责任推到我身上
And you think you can lay the blame on me.

469
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:28,080
你知道这么做的后果吗
Do you realize what you've done?

470
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:31,004
为了伤害我
In trying to hurt me,

471
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:34,028
你会严重地伤害你母亲
You'll have caused tremendous damage to your mother.

472
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:36,078
总统一向是公开反对
The president has gone on record

473
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,029
任何情况下的刑讯逼供的
That torture is unacceptable under any circumstances.

474
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,012
这事一旦曝光  看上去鲍尔
When this gets out,it will look like bauer was sent

475
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:45,019
就是被派去折磨犯人的
Exactly for that.

476
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,079
这将成为一场政治浩劫
It'll be a political disaster.

477
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,036
你这次玩过头了
You've gone too far this time.

478
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,036
我受够你的唠叨了
I'm not listening to you anymore.

479
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:52,006
我不会让你轻易得逞的
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

480
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:54,007
把你的手放开
Get your hands off me.

481
00:23:55,014 --> 00:23:58,076
作为美国人  我们应该同舟共济
As americans, We should stand together

482
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:00,057
为我们的成就感到自豪
proud of what we have achieved.

483
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:04,034
感谢那些今晚  在我们祖国大地上
Thanks to the efforts and the sacrifices

484
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:09,021
不屈不挠  抛头颅洒热血的
Of so many,this place,our national home,

485
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:12,008
仁人志士们
Stands tall tonight.

486
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:16,005
我们的人民可以安然入睡了
And all our citizens can sleep soundly with the knowledge

487
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:21,039
因为自由的荣光仍在闪耀
That the blessings of freedom continue to shine upon us all.

488
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,053
没有  东北区域不见鲍尔的踪影
No,there's been no sign of bauer in the northeast sector,

489
00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:27,020
把警戒线范围扩展到25英里标记处
So expand your cordon to the 25-mile mark.

490
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:29,027
做好支援首府警局的准备
And be prepared to back up metro.

491
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,097
我正叫他们在全城随机抽查过往车辆
I'm directing them to begin random traffic stops,citywide.

492
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:34,011
谢谢
Thank you.

493
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:36,091
我把蕾妮传给鲍尔的数据分离出来了
I isolated the data renee uploaded to bauer,

494
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:38,061
但文件标题后的内容我就进不去了
But i can't get past the file header.

495
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,001
什么意思
What does that mean?

496
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:41,078
她把姓名地址都加密了
She encrypted the name and address she used,

497
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,045
我解不开
And i can't seem to crack it.

498
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,075
-解不开吗  -她用的是她的个人电脑
- You can't? - she used her personal computer.

499
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:47,022
这个加密非常复杂
This is very serious encryption.

500
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:50,086
-只有一些高手才能做到  -谁能
- I mean,there are some high-level people who can do it. - like who?

501
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:52,042
克罗伊·奥布赖恩  但你告诉我
Chloe o'brian-- but from what you've

502
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:53,096
她对鲍尔忠心不二
told me,she's too loyal to Bauer.

503
00:24:53,097 --> 00:24:56,083
她丈夫还在这里吗
Is her husband still here?

504
00:24:56,084 --> 00:24:58,024
是的  他正等着见你呢
Yeah. He's waiting to see you.

505
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:02,031
档案上显示他也是六级分析员
According to her file,he's a level-six analyst,too.

506
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:06,014
我不知道还要在这里待多久
I have no idea how much longer i'm going to be here.

507
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:08,087
帮我个忙好吗  在你把普雷斯科特
Just do me a favor and give prescott his babu

508
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,081
放上床睡觉前  把巴布熊给他
Before you put him down.

509
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:14,058
好的  我迟些打给你
Yeah,i'm going to have to call you back. yeah.

510
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,041
奥布赖恩先生  我是拉里·莫斯
Mr. o'brian,i'm larry moss.

511
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,046
我想要见我妻子
Yeah,i'd like to see my wife.

512
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:21,016
没问题
All right.

513
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,010
你们凭什么关她
What the bloody hell are you holding her for?

514
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:33,000
妨碍公务  篡改证据
Obstruction,evidence tampering.

515
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:34,093
我觉得你更应该考虑的是
I think you should be more concerned about

516
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:37,004
-怎么把她弄出来  -什么
- What you can do to get her out. - sorry?

517
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:38,094
帮我们找到杰克·鲍尔
Help us find jack bauer.

518
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:40,074
上次克洛伊提到他时
Last i heard from chloe,

519
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:42,077
杰克还在为局里工作
jack was working for the bureau.

520
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:44,075
如果我没弄错的话  他是为你办事
That's you,if i'm not mistaken.

521
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,078
以前是
He was.

522
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,008
直到他突然失控  杀了一个联邦证人
Until he snapped and murdered a federal witness.

523
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,051
真的吗
Really?

524
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:51,022
我很难相信
I find that hard to believe.

525
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,088
当前最重要的是
All that's relevant here is that your wife

526
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,065
你妻子会因跟鲍尔串谋而被起诉
Is going to be prosecuted for colluding with bauer,

527
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,025
除非你帮我们找到他
Unless you help us find him.

528
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:57,082
奥布赖恩先生
Mr. o'brian,

529
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,066
不久前
A short time ago,

530
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:01,059
我们的一个探员跟杰克·鲍尔联系过
One of our agents was in touch with jack bauer.

531
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,069
她发了一个地址和名字给他
She sent a name and address

532
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,043
我们判断杰克应该是去那了
That we assume is his next destination.

533
00:26:05,044 --> 00:26:08,027
很不幸  这是用河豚148算法加密的
Unfortunately,it's encrypted with blowfish 148.

534
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:10,077
这里的人都不知道怎么破解
No one here knows how to crack that.

535
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:12,080
所以我们需要你的帮助
Therefore,we need your help.

536
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:14,054
请帮帮我们
Please.

537
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:15,085
你们得知道
You have to understand something.

538
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:19,078
杰克·鲍尔跟我太太的交情甚笃
Jack bauer and my wife have a very long history.

539
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,061
我也把他当做朋友
I consider him to be a friend.

540
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,028
他会有在法庭上申诉的机会的
And he'll have his day in court.

541
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,075
但你太太的这个案子是铁证如山
But the case against your wife is rock solid.

542
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:29,009
我办不到
I can't.

543
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,016
你太太面临的是至少15年的监禁
We're talking about her serving a minimum sentence of 15 years.

544
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:36,064
她出狱的时候你儿子都19岁了
Your son will be 19 by the time she gets out of prison.

545
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:51,082
我要份完全豁免权的担保书
I want guarantees of full immunity,

546
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:55,018
不用坐牢  撤销所有指控和案底
No jail time,expulsion of all charges from her record.

547
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,028
我答应你

548
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:59,002
-你是这份协议的见证人  -好的
- You are a witness to this agreement. - Yes.

549
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:01,049
给我看看文件
Show me the file.

550
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,058
原始信息是16位还是32位字长的
Original information-- 16- or 32-bit word length?

551
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,089
32位的
thirty-two.

552
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,073
是原始的还是修改的数据点
Native or modified data points?

553
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:11,020
原始的
Native.

554
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:15,067
这个算法的设计者
The designer of this algorithm

555
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,030
在他的代码里植入了后门程序
Built a backdoor into his code.

556
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:19,057
如果你知道超驰代码  解密就轻而易举
Decryption's a piece of cake if you know the override codes.

557
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:20,081
你知道
And you do?

558
00:27:20,082 --> 00:27:22,067
当然
Yeah.

559
00:27:22,068 --> 00:27:24,061
要很久吗
Will this take long?

560
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:26,062
当然不会
Course not.

561
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:31,082
奥布赖恩先生  你能确切告诉我们
Mr. o'brian,can you tell me specifically

562
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,099
什么时候这份文件能解密完
When you'll have the file decrypted?

563
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,033
好的
Yes.

564
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,002
解完了
Now.

565
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:42,057
你的探员让杰克去乔治敦
Your agent sent jack to

566
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,049
迪尔布鲁克大街951号
951 deerbrook avenue,georgetown,

567
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,064
参议员布莱恩·迈尔的住宅
Residence of senator blaine mayer.

568
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:52,067
召集外勤小组  告诉他们鲍尔的位置
Assemble the field teams. Tell them we have a probable location on bauer.

569
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:55,032
叫首府警局也开始行动
And get metro pd on the way.

570
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,054
迈尔的手机接不通
No luck reaching mayer on his cell

571
00:28:14,054 --> 00:28:15,070
家里电话也一样
or at the house.

572
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,030
电话公司说  那边的线路短路了
The phone company said the line was shorted out on-site.

573
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,040
没错  准是鲍尔干的
Yeah,that's bauer.

574
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,080
他为什么这么做
Why is he doing this?

575
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,020
因为过去的6个月以来
Because mayer spent the last six months

576
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,037
迈尔一直想让鲍尔在狱中度过余生
Trying to send bauer to prison for the rest of his life.

577
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:28,064
好吧  首府警局正赶往迈尔的住宅
All right,metro pd is closing in on mayer's residence.

578
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:31,095
我已批准  一旦到齐就位  就冲进去
I've authorized them to move in as soon as they're in position and at strength.

579
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:33,018
我提醒过他们
I told them,

580
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:36,062
也提醒下你们  不要低估鲍尔
and i'm telling you,it is impossible to overestimate bauer.

581
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:38,062
他训练有素  经验老道
He has more training and more experience

582
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:40,079
比我们这里  包括我在内的任何人都要强
Than anybody in this room,and that includes myself.

583
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,002
好了  开始行动
Okay,let's move.

584
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:44,089
莫斯探员将会跟联邦探员一起
Agent moss will be running on-point tactical

585
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,086
在5号频道执行高级战术行动
with fbi teams on five.

586
00:28:46,086 --> 00:28:49,040
所有小组都必须将通话频道与我连接
All units must register and log their com through me,

587
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,028
我会分发识别码和认证码
And i will distribute recognition codes and credentials.

588
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,060
-克罗伊  -简直无法相信
- Chloe... - i can't believe you.

589
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,017
你竟然帮他们抓杰克
You're helping them catch jack.

590
00:29:00,017 --> 00:29:01,071
我都是为了你
I did it for you.

591
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:03,048
这是我最不想要你做的
This is the last thing i would have wanted.

592
00:29:03,048 --> 00:29:05,038
-你怎么做得出来  -想想看  起先
- How could you do this?  - let's see,for a start,

593
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:07,025
我想  也许普雷斯科特就不必因为有个
I thought it might be nice to spare prescott

594
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:10,042
罪犯妈妈而给他带来诸多不便了
The inconvenience of having a convict for a mother.

595
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:13,025
-杰克救过你  -我并没有否认  我欠他的
- Jack saved your life. - i don't deny that i owe him.

596
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:18,006
但我的孩子跟婚姻是第一位的
But my child and my marriage comes first,

597
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,036
你也应该这么想
And it should for you,too.

598
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:22,086
克罗伊  你帮杰克够多了
Chloe,love,you've helped jack enough.

599
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:24,073
真的
You have.

600
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:30,040
你不能再自作主张牺牲自己了
And you can't go deciding to make this sacrifice on your own any more.

601
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,017
但他并没有干过他们说的那些事啊
But he didn't do what they're saying he did.

602
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:35,094
那么他被捕后可以再证明自己清白
Then he can prove that when they take him into custody.

603
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:38,091
那也要他们给他机会才行
If they give him the chance.

604
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:56,026
今早的听证会上
At the hearing this morning,

605
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:59,077
你说你对自己的所作所为无怨无悔
you said you had no regrets about what you've done.

606
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:03,074
但我看到的是一个极度悔恨的人
But what i saw was a man full of regret.

607
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:06,047
参议员  我当然有悔恨的事
Of course i have regrets,senator.

608
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:12,008
我悔恨失去了家庭
I regret losing my family.

609
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:15,008
我妻子被杀是因为我负责保护
My wife was murdered because i was responsible

610
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:19,048
戴维·帕默尔免遭刺杀
For protecting david palmer during an assassination attempt.

611
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,029
我的女儿现在甚至都不能看我一眼
My daughter can't even look at me.

612
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:27,026
每天  我都后悔瞥见的那一双双世人的眼睛
Every day,i regret looking into the eyes of men,women and children,

613
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,066
我深知  或许就在下一刻
Knowing that,any moment,

614
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:30,080
他们就会被当做牺牲品
Their lives might be deemed expendable

615
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
只为维护那更高的利益
In an effort to protect the greater good.

616
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,064
我后悔每一个造成
I regret every decision or mistake i might have made

617
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:41,051
无辜生命死亡的决定或错误
That resulted in the loss of a single innocent life.

618
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:44,068
但你知道我最后悔的是什么吗
But you know what i regret the most?

619
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:48,068
是这个世界还需要像我这样的人
Is that this world even needs people like me.

620
00:30:50,018 --> 00:30:52,025
所以你觉得我会天真到去相信
So you think i'm naive to believe

621
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:54,059
我们要为一个更高的标准而战斗吗
We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard of combat?

622
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,059
我怎么想不重要  参议员
Doesn't even matter what i think,senator.

623
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,029
你只需要理解我工作的地方
You just need to understand where i work,

624
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:02,029
比你的国会要肮脏得多
Things get a lot messier than where you work on the hill.

625
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:07,037
鲍尔  你遭受的那些是个悲剧
What you've lost,mr. bauer,is tragic.

626
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:09,040
以拯救无辜生命之名
What you've been compelled to do

627
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,004
你被迫所做的一切都是悲剧
In the name of saving innocent life is tragic.

628
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:18,031
有时候我们需要经受最可怕的炼狱
Sometimes we need to incur the most horrible losses

629
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:20,051
就为了坚持理想
In order to uphold the ideals

630
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:22,048
这些理想是我们国家的基石
That this country was founded on.

631
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:25,035
要是我们不以身作则
How can we presume to lead the world

632
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:28,032
怎么还有脸引领世界
Unless we set an example?

633
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:31,086
你说得轻巧
You make it sound so simple.

634
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:33,079
也许就是比你想的简单
Well,maybe it's simpler than you think.

635
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:37,035
也许你所看到的和你所做的一切
Maybe all the things that you've seen and all the things that you've done

636
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:39,013
已经蒙蔽了你的双眼
have clouded your vision.

637
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,094
看这个
Look at this.

638
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:49,038
给我说说这起车祸
Tell me about this car accident.

639
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:51,048
这跟朱玛没关系
That has nothing to do with juma.

640
00:31:51,048 --> 00:31:52,078
受害者是谁
Who was the victim?

641
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:55,048
一个安插在斯塔克伍德里的线人
A source inside of starkwood. A whistle-blower.

642
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:56,095
不幸的是  他还是个酒鬼
Unfortunately,he was also a drunk.

643
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:59,005
在他从大西洋城回家的路上
He was killed when he wrecked his car

644
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:00,049
出车祸死了
On the way home from atlantic city.

645
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:03,015
血液酒精含量超标
Blood alcohol off the charts.

646
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:09,070
参议员  这绝对不是事故
Senator,this was no accident.

647
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,073
杀你线人的跟今晚
Your informant was murdered by the same man

648
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:13,040
杀伯内特的是同一个人
Who took ryan burnett out this evening.

649
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,080
这意味着什么呢  鲍尔
What does this mean,bauer?

650
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,007
他们怕他泄密
They were scared of what he had to say.

651
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:18,060
你的线人到底知道斯塔克伍德什么秘密
What does your informant have on starkwood?

652
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,094
他提出过很多轻率的指控
He made a lot of wild accusations,

653
00:32:19,094 --> 00:32:21,098
但是没一次是可以告倒他们的
But not a single one of them panned out.

654
00:32:21,098 --> 00:32:23,054
或许是因为你查得不够深
Maybe you didn't dig deep enough.

655
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:25,054
参议员  我要知道他究竟告诉你什么了
Senator,i need to know exactly what he told you.

656
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:27,071
他声称斯塔克伍德
He alleged that starkwood

657
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,038
在勒索五角大楼的官员
Was blackmailing pentagon officials.

658
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:31,075
说他们涉嫌暗杀
That they were involved in assassination plots.

659
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,035
甚至说他们企图得到大规模杀伤性武器
Even that they were seeking to acquire their own wmds.

660
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,069
具体的是什么
Specifically what?

661
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,042
我记不清了  但我确信
Well,i don't remember,but i'm sure

662
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,065
电脑里应该有和他接头时的记录
That his interview transcript should be there.

663
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:43,076
好的  我找到了
Okay,i got it.

664
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:46,003
天哪
Oh,my god.

665
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:47,020
这就是了
That's it.

666
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,033
什么
What?

667
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,006
你的线人声称斯塔克伍德公司
Your informant claims that starkwood

668
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:51,020
企图获得生化武器
Was trying to acquire a bioweapon.

669
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,061
这就能联系上朱玛了
That's your connection to juma.

670
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:53,064
我不明白
I don't understand.

671
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:55,041
朱玛掌权的时候  传闻他在
When juma was in power,it was rumored

672
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,048
实施一项研制非法武器的计划
That he was running an illegal weapons program.

673
00:32:57,048 --> 00:32:59,025
他在研发一种生化武器
He was developing a bioweapon,

674
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:00,045
但没有人能证明
But nobody could prove it.

675
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,036
但是我在桑加拉时认识的人
But the people that i knew in sangala

676
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:04,092
坚信朱玛在拿自己的国民做实验
Believed he was testing these weapons on his own population.

677
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:08,013
他在一个偏僻的山村里释放了一种病菌
He used a remote village, Released some kind of pathogen.

678
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:09,086
那里所有的人变得痴呆
Everyone there was struck with dementia,

679
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,013
然后瘫痪  直至死亡
Paralysis and eventually died.

680
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:13,073
为什么没人追究
Why wasn't this pursued?

681
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:15,072
因为朱玛毁灭了所有的证据
'cause juma destroyed all the evidence.

682
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:17,071
他抢先一步  用燃烧弹把那里夷为了平地
He firebombed the village  before anyone could get there,

683
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:20,080
联合国的官员也总是很难相信
and UN officials had a hard time believing that juma had the technology

684
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,094
朱玛有技术和专长造出这样的武器
Or expertise to develop such a weapon.

685
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:25,057
但斯塔克伍德公司则是二者兼备
But starkwood... they had both.

686
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:27,067
技术和专长
The technology and the expertise.

687
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:29,088
那朱玛得给他们提供什么呢
And what did juma have to offer starkwood?

688
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,081
研发武器的安全场所
A safe haven to develop the weapon

689
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:34,061
和取之不尽的实验品
And an endless supply of victims to test it on.

690
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:37,095
即使这些都是真的
Even if all this was true,why in the world

691
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:40,022
那斯塔克伍德公司要生化武器干嘛
Would starkwood want a bioweapon?

692
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:42,099
参议员  过去的6个月
Senator,you've been trying to dismantle starkwood

693
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:44,062
你都在努力关闭斯塔克伍德公司
For the last six months.

694
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:46,066
这可能就是他们所策划的反击
Maybe they planned on fighting back.

695
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,076
但不管怎样  如果他们拥有这样的武器
But regardless,if they have a weapon like this,

696
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:51,056
你最好做好他们可能使用它的思想准备
You better believe they intend to use it.

697
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,093
迈尔参议员
Senator mayer!

698
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:55,061
我是首府警察
This is metro pd!

699
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:57,024
别动
Don't you move.

700
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:03,051
等等  等等
Hold on. hold on!

701
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:06,021
很明显  你发现了些线索
You're obviously on to something.

702
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:09,075
他们能帮你找到证明你清白的证据
They can help you find the evidence you need to prove your case.

703
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:12,015
现在他们都以为是我杀了伯内特
Right now everyone thinks i killed ryan burnett.

704
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:14,029
-没人会听我的  -我能保护你
- No one's gonna listen to me. - i can protect you.

705
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:15,079
我可以命令他们来帮助我们
I can order them to help us.

706
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:17,084
斯塔克伍德已经渗透到白宫了
Starkwood infiltrated the white house.

707
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:19,049
一旦他们发现你在追查他们研发
As soon as they find out you're going after them

708
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:22,005
生化武器一事  就会马上销毁证据的
For a bioweapon,they'll bury the evidence.

709
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:23,096
那么我们就让知道的人越少越好
Then we'll keep the circle small.

710
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:25,090
我可以做到的
I can make this happen.

711
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,037
你牺牲了这么多来保护政府
It's time for you to start trusting the institutions

712
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:31,087
该是你相信它一回的时候了
That you've sacrificed so much to protect.

713
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,087
信任可不是我最大的优点
Trust isn't my greatest asset.

714
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,078
孩子  你总要有所转变
Son,you have to start somewhere.

715
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:39,068
参议员
Senator!

716
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:41,041
我是首府警察
This is metro pd!

717
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,062
你真的认为你能做到吗
You really think you can do this?

718
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:45,072
我对自己有信心
I know i can.

719
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,069
让他们进来吧
Let 'em in.

720
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:04,090
不
No!

721
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:03,078
你要见我
You wanted to see me?

722
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,011
是的  利维
Yes,livy.

723
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:09,065
伊桑刚报告给我一件很恼人的事情
Ethan just come to me with something very disturbing.

724
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:12,082
我想是有关向媒体透露杰克消息的事吧
I assume it's about the press leak regarding jack bauer.

725
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:17,022
伊桑觉得你跟这事有关
Ethan seems to think you had something to do with it.

726
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:18,063
不是我干的
I didn't.

727
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:20,033
我已经告诉过他了
I already told him that.

728
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:24,059
鉴于你俩之前的过节  他不相信你
Well,given the past experience between the two of you,he's not convinced.

729
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,050
你怎么认为呢
And what do you think?

730
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,040
我想听听你怎么说
I think i need to hear what you have to say.

731
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,034
她没什么好辩解的  总统阁下
There's nothing she can say,madam president.

732
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:33,017
只有几个人知道详情
She was one of the few people

733
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:34,074
她是其中之一
Who knew all the details.

734
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:37,068
知道的人  比你想象得要多
More people knew than you think.

735
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,042
我刚和CNB电视台的
I just got off the phone

736
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:42,042
白宫栏目制片人通过电话
with the white house segment producer at CNB.

737
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,002
他不愿透露线人的名字
He won't give me the source's name,

738
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,025
但是他愿意证明
But he's willing to confirm

739
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,089
是联邦执法办里的人走漏了消息
That the leak came from someone inside the Federal Marshal's office.

740
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:51,043
他担保消息既不是从白宫散布出去的
He'll guarantee it didn't come from the white house,

741
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,013
也不是从我这泄露出去的
Or from me.

742
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:56,053
可以证明给我看吗
This is verifiable?

743
00:36:57,093 --> 00:37:00,010
制片人的名字叫查理·艾萨克森
Producer's name is charlie isakson.

744
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,080
这是他的电话
Here's his number.

745
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,087
不信的话  你可以亲自打给他
You can call him yourself if you'd like.

746
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,045
我给了艾萨克森一个提议
I offered isakson some

747
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:14,031
如果他不报道此事  就可以做你的专访
Exclusive time with you if he killed the story,

748
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,012
他同意了
And he agreed.

749
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,012
只要我们拘押鲍尔
So as long as we get bauer in custody,

750
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:20,042
消息就不会走漏出去了
We should be able to keep the fallout contained.

751
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,080
伊桑  在这种情况下
Ethan,under the circumstances,

752
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,043
我想很明显  是你搞错了
I think it seems clear that you were mistaken.

753
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,060
我对此很满意
I'm satisfied.

754
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,076
你呢
Are you?

755
00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:34,023
我也是  总统阁下
Yes,madam president.

756
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:37,064
奥利维亚  如果是我错判了当前形势
I'm sorry,olivia, if i misjudged

757
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:40,081
并错怪了你  我向你道歉
The situation... And you.

758
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:43,024
我想知道调查局
I want to know

759
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:45,058
在搜捕鲍尔这事上有什么进展
If the fbi's any closer to finding bauer.

760
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:47,018
好的  阁下
Yes,ma'am.

761
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,078
就这样吧
That's all.

762
00:37:58,003 --> 00:37:59,069
对不起
I'm sorry

763
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:02,043
-让你身处如此境地  -我能理解的
- I put you on the spot like that. - i understand.

764
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:04,043
伊桑让你别无选择
Ethan didn't give you much of a choice.

765
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:05,063
我只希望
I just hope

766
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:08,053
他们能在情况变糟之前  找到鲍尔
They find bauer before this gets any worse.

767
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:28,040
你快不行了
You're dying.

768
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,031
告诉我  武器要运到哪
Just tell me where the weapons are coming in.

769
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,061
什么时间运到
When are they getting here?

770
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,044
已经运到这了
They're already here.

771
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:04,069
[亚历山大港  C2230区]
Port of Alexandria. Yard C. 2230.

772
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:15,001
詹尼斯  我是拉里
Janis,it's larry.

773
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:16,092
我们来晚了一步
We got here too late.

774
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:18,075
鲍尔杀害了迈尔参议员
Bauer murdered senator mayer.

775
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:21,039
把搜捕范围扩大到整个地区
Escalate the search for him to region-wide.

776
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,059
通知方圆50英里内所有分部调派增援
I want reinforcements from every branch Within 50 miles brought into this.

777
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:26,025
收到
Copy that.

778
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:27,093
鉴于目前形势
At this point...

779
00:42:27,093 --> 00:42:30,034
我授权你们一见嫌犯  格杀勿论
Orders are to shoot on sight.

780
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,080
喂
Yeah.

781
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,007
托尼  我是杰克
Tony,it's jack.

782
00:42:37,007 --> 00:42:38,087
杰克  我一直监视着调查局的线路
Jack,i've been monitoring the fbi bandwidth.

783
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:40,031
到底发生什么了
What the hell's going on?

784
00:42:40,031 --> 00:42:42,024
兄弟  我需要你的帮助  你在哪
Listen,man,i need your help. where are you?

785

00:42:48,058 --> 00:42:50,068
-尽快赶到那里  -杰克  等等
- Get there as soon as possible. - jack,wait.

789
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:54,072
来不及了  路上我再打给你
I can't. i'll get back to you as soon as i'm en route.
