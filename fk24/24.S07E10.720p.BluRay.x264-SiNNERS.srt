《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,026
总统阁下  我们找到了您的丈夫
Madam president, we have your husband,

5
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,053
可是他胸部中枪
But he sustained a gunshot wound to the chest.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,017
我丈夫能挺过去吗
is my husband going to be okay?

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:25,007
这得等医生诊断后才知道
We're not going to know anything until the doctors see him.

8
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:27,017
既然您丈夫是杜巴库唯一的筹码
Since your husband was the only leverage that Dubaku had left,

9
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:29,044
现在可以肯定他会试图越境
It's safe to say that he's trying to leave the country now.

10
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:30,054
不管我们采取什么行动找到他
Whatever we're going to do to find him,

11
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:31,068
都得快马加鞭了
We're going to have to do it fast.

12
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,091
不惜一切代价
Whatever it takes,

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,008
一定要找到那个狗杂种
I want that son of a bitch found!

14
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:37,032
派人去找我女儿奥利维亚
Have someone find my daughter, Olivia,

15
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,088
把她带来见我
And bring her to me.

16
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:40,045
什么事那么重要
What is it that's so important

17
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:42,052
我妈非得在我谈生意时
For my mother to steal me away while I'm trying

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,029
-唤我出来  -你爸出事了
- To do business? - It's your father.

19
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:45,036
他中枪了
He's been shot.

20
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:47,036
天哪  我...
My, god, i...

21
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:49,063
你以为我是傻子吗  伯内特先生
Do you think I'm a fool, Mr. Burnett?

22
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,086
如果我在逃离这个国家的途中
If anything should happen to me

23
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,047
遭遇不测
On my way out of the country,

24
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,037
一份写满涉案人员的的黑名单
A data file with all the names and bank transactions

25
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:58,037
和银行交易的文档将被会送到司法部门
Of all those involved will be sent to the justice department.

26
00:00:58,044 --> 00:01:01,011
你说过一旦杜巴库得偿所愿
You told me that once Dubaku served his purpose,

27
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:02,044
你就会把他干掉
You'd take him out.

28
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:03,098
我们为什么还要帮他
Why are we still helping him?

29
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,021
他保留了资料库  以揭发我们相要挟
He's threatening to expose us using a database he's kept

30
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:07,098
其中包括所有涉案人员的名字和帐户
With names and accounts of everyone involved.

31
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,058
有我的吗
Including mine?

32
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:10,082
还不知道档案在哪里
We don't know where the file is,

33
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,055
所以你最好祈祷他能逃过此劫
So you just better pray that he gets away.

34
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:14,002
求你了  玛丽卡
I'm begging you, Marika...

35
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,055
联邦调查员  不许动
FBI! don't move!

36
00:01:15,062 --> 00:01:16,072
跪下  快
Get on your knees! now!

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,096
杜巴库在哪里
Where is Dubaku?

38
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:19,029
谁
Who?

39
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:21,019
别耍花样  埃克·杜巴库
Don't play games with me! Ike Dubaku!

40
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,056
你认识这个人吗
you know this man?

41
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:24,036
她正要去见他
She was going to meet him.

42
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,000
等车到这里  我们希望你
When the car arrives, we would like you

43
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,093
能跟着司机走  以便我们能跟踪你
To go with the driver, so that we could follow you

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,037
顺藤摸瓜找到杜巴库
Back to Dubaku.

45
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:31,004
你想让她和杜巴库会面吗
You want her to go to him and face him?

46
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,051
这是他人间蒸发前我们找到他的
It's the  only chance we have of finding him before he

47
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:35,007
-最后一线希望  -我愿意
- Disappears forever. - I'll do it.

48
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,014
一定要确保她安然无恙  听到了吗
You keep her safe, you hear me?

49
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:38,038
一定
We will.

50
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:40,038
你们距离目标车辆不到一英里
You're less than a mile behind the target car.

51
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:42,025
首府警局在我们周围设置了路障
I got Metro PDs trying to build a roadblock around us.

52
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,019
千万不能让他们跑了  杰克
We can't afford to lose them, Jack!

53
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,072
我承诺会保护她
I gave this woman my word we'd protect her.

54
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,051
下车  放慢动作
Get out of the vehicle, slowly!

55
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,063
-她是联邦调查员  -跪下
She's a federal agent! on your knees!

56
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:56,036
-她是联邦调查员  -趴在地上
She's a federal agent! on the ground!

57
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:00,017
联调局说服了你马子
Your girlfriend's been turned by the FBI.

58
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:01,037
如果她去见你
If you let her come to you,

59
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:02,097
你就很难开溜
You're risking your chances of escape.

60
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:05,017
我会打电话给司机  让他处置她
I'll call my driver, have him take care of her.

61
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,084
不  我亲自处理
No. I'll take care of her.

62
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:13,086
以下事件发生在下午五点到六点
The following takes place between 5:00 p.m.and 6:00 p.m.

西恩
Sean,

68
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,076
-我想和你谈谈  -有要紧事吗
- I need to talk to you. - Is it important?

69
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,067
你说呢  你有没有签发
You tell me. did you issue

70
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:35,063
-对这辆车的逮捕令  -什么
- A federal warrant on this vehicle? - What?

71
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,077
我在4号服务器的备用分区上
I found a digital footprint

72
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:38,020
发现了一处历史记录
On server four's backup partition.

73
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:40,021
来源于你的工作台  我想知道
It originated from your station. I'd like to know

74
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,027
-究竟是怎么回事  -小声点
- What the hell is going on! - Keep your voice down.

75
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:44,014
你想让我们被抓起来吗
You want to get us caught?

76
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:45,051
我发出了逮捕令
I sent out the warrant,

77
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:47,045
拖住鲍尔和蕾妮
To sideline Bauer and Renee.

78
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:49,031
他们正围追杜巴库
They were closing in on Dubaku.

79
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,078
你说过杜巴库已经在越境的途中
I thought you said Dubaku's on his way out of the country?

80
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:54,022
没错  可是他马子正协助联调局
He is, but his girlfriend's talking to FBI.

81
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,012
他们利用她来追踪杜巴库
They used her to track him.

82
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:57,036
天哪
Oh, my god.

83
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,012
别担心  我会处理好的
Don't worry, I took care of it.

84
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,069
鲍尔和蕾妮已经被警方拘留
Bauer and Renee are in police custody.

85
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:02,003
等到他们被释放时
By the time they're released,

86
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,023
杜巴库早已远走高飞
Dubaku will be long gone.

87
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,036
确定吗
Are you sure?

88
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:06,053
确定
I'm positive.

89
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,023
你为什么不告诉我事态的发展呢
Why didn't you just tell me what was happening?

90
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,020
因为我就知道你会有过激反应
'cause I knew you'd react like this.

91
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,027
现在我只要你保持平静
The last thing I need right now is one of your meltdowns.

92
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,098
听着  是我拉你下水的
Now, listen, I got you into this,

93
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:19,048
我一定会让你全身而退
And I'm going to get you out of it,

94
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:21,055
可你绝不能方寸大乱
But not if you start panicking.

95
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:22,085
你得临阵不慌
You've got to keep it together.

96
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,018
我真被吓坏了  你知道吗
I'm just really scared, you know?

97
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,098
知道  我也是
I know. I am, too.

98
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,012
我只是比你更擅长瞒天过海
I'm just a little better at hiding it than you are.

99
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,052
一切都已安排得天衣无缝
I've got everything covered.

100
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,036
我在监听会议室
I ran a bounce-tap into the conference room

101
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,019
他们不会发现我在扩音器里装了窃听器
Speakerphone that they'll never find,

102
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:34,086
我可以窃听他们的谈话
And I can hear everything they're saying.

103
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,033
现在你就乖乖待在你的工作台
Now, sit at your station.

104
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,046
表现得一如往常就好了
Try and act normal.

105
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:42,067
我来处理鲍尔和蕾妮
Let me worry about Bauer and Renee.

106
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:44,074
好吗
Okay?

107
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:51,031
我们追踪的人
The man that we were tracking is responsible

108
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:52,074
是今天发生的恐怖袭击的主谋
For today's terrorist attack.

109
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,068
你不放了我们  他就会逃之夭夭
If you don't let us go, he's going to get away.

110
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,092
我的队长正在和你的上司打电话
Look, my captain's on the phone with your superior.

111
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:58,008
你们错了
You're making a mistake!

112
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:59,065
放我们走
You've got to let us go!

113
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,039
逮捕令一定是杜巴库手下卧底发的
That warrant had to be sent out by one of Dubaku's operatives.

114
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:08,013
-我知道  -他也会知道玛丽卡是我们一伙的
I know. then Dubaku knows that Marika is working with us.

115
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,039
他会杀人灭口  杰克
He will kill her, Jack.

116
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:10,086
我们不该利用她
We should not have used her like this.

117
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,040
我们别无选择  她是我们唯一的筹码
We didn't have a choice. she was our only asset.

118
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:14,077
她不是筹码  杰克  她是个大活人
She's not an asset, Jack. she's a human being.

119
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,052
上校
Colonel.

120
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:36,072
联调局还在找我们  先生
The FBI is still looking for us, sir.

121
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,079
我会速战速决  在原地待命
I'll do this quickly. wait there for me.

122
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,090
塞缪尔
Samuel.

123
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:47,057
怎么了
What? what is it?

124
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:48,067
亲爱的  怎么了
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

125
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:49,070
把手机给我
Give me your cell phone.

126
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:51,017
我的手机吗
My cell phone?

127
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,064
我知道你一直在和联调局联系
I know you've been talking to the FBI.

128
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:55,057
你一直为他们工作  玛丽卡
You've been working for them, Marika.

129
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:58,034
你胡言乱语什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

130
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,091
你到底在干什么
What? what are you doing?

131
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,042
不
No!

132
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:14,089
我那么相信你
I trusted you!

133
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,036
你怎么可以这么对我
How could you do this to me?!

134
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:19,080
联调局告诉了我你的真面目
The FBI told me who you really are.

135
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:22,080
还有你犯下的累累罪行
About the terrible things you've done.

136
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:24,044
-你竟然相信了他们  -他们给我看了证据
- And you believed them? - They showed me proof!

137
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,064
他们给你看的是我敌人捏造的伪证
They showed you lies created by my enemies!

138
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,031
你不了解我

139

也不了解我的祖国
And you don't know my country.

140

我给桑加拉带来了和平

141

143
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:42,075
只是
It's just...

144
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:44,039
当我得知你背叛了我时
When I heard what you had done,

145
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:45,066
那一刻  就像是

146

你将匕首刺穿了我的心脏

我是个宽宏大量的男人  玛丽卡

我仍旧希望你跟我远走高飞

我不能跟你走

151
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:04,018
我不知道你究竟是谁
I don't know who you are.

152
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:06,034
你知道
You do.

153
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,071
你知道  如果你的目光不再停留在恐惧感上
You do. if you look past your fear,

154
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:11,005
你会明白我还是原来那个
You'll see that I am still the man that you

155
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,078
和你相爱的人

157
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,053

抱歉误解了你

联调局找到玛丽卡·道诺索了吗
Did FBI find Marika Donoso?

163
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:58,043
不清楚  你可以自己问他们

164

I want to spend time with people I really care about.

197

223
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,016
她的腿被压住了

224
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,070
抓住

238
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:50,086
卡桑加省的难民营
The refugee camp in Kasanga province.

2,000 civilians are safe from Juma's forces.

240
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,041
总统阁下
Madam president?

241
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,074
抱歉  伊桑
I'm sorry, Ethan.

242
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,068
天哪  卡桑加省
Oh, my god, Kasanga province.

243
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:06,015
真是个好消息
That's... that's very good news.

244
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:09,055
可能我们应该
Uh, maybe we should

245
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:11,082
另找时间谈这些
Finish this another time.

246
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,092
我能为您效劳吗
Can I get you anything,

247
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,009
总统阁下
Madam president?

248
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:17,029
不用  谢谢
No, thank you.

249
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:19,063
想说说心里话吗
Would you like to talk about it?

250
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:26,070
亨利弄成这样都是我的错  伊桑
What happened to Henry was my fault, Ethan.

251
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,037
他一直不相信我们儿子是自杀
He never believed our son committed suicide.

252
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,087
他没错
He was right.

253
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:35,088
而我却置若罔闻
And I didn't listen to him.

254
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:37,034
如果我当时相信他
And if I had, we wouldn't

255
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,055
就不会是现在这个局面了
Be here right now.

256
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:40,068
亨利就不用冒死调查真相
Henry wouldn't be fighting for his life,

257
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:43,078
那样我们早就揭穿了阴谋
And we might have exposed this conspiracy.

258
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:47,019
整个政府也不会陷入瘫痪
Our government wouldn't be paralyzed.

259
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,062
我也没相信亨利
I didn't believe Henry, either.

260
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,079
谁都没信他
No one did.

261
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:53,003
但是我是他妻子
But I'm his wife.

262
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:55,090
他应当得到我的信任
He deserved my trust.

263
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,087
总统阁下
Madam president?

264
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:02,007
抱歉打扰了
I'm sorry to interrupt.

265
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:03,007
没关系  比尔
It's all right, Bill.

266
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:04,010
请讲吧
Go ahead.

267
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:06,041
我跟联调局的拉里·莫斯通过电话
I just spoke to Larry Moss at FBI.

268
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,078
我们抓到杜巴库了
We captured Dubaku.

269
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,078
追击的时候  发生了车祸
He was seriously injured in a car crash

270
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,075
-杜巴库伤得不轻  -有多严重
During the pursuit. how bad?

271
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,091
很危急  已经失去知觉了
Critical, nonresponsive.

272
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:14,065
杰克和沃克探员跟他在一起
Jack Bauer and agent Walker are with him.

273
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:16,025
杜巴库一恢复意识
They'll be there to question him

274
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:17,095
他们就会审问他
Should he regain consciousness.

275
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,049
那么你就是说  如果杜巴库死了
So, you're saying that if Dubaku dies, our chances

276
00:14:20,056 --> 00:14:21,099
我们揭穿这个阴谋的机会也就成了泡影
Of uncovering this conspiracy die with him.

277
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,079
他很有可能是唯一一个
He could be the only one who knows

278
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:25,023
知道政府里所有腐败人员名单的人
The names of everyone in the government

279
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,063
是的没错
He's corrupted-- yes.

280
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,073
总统阁下
Madam president,

281
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,020
鉴于当前形势
Given this latest news, I don't think

282
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,073
我认为您在这是不安全的
It's safe for you to remain here.

283
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,043
强烈建议您回到白宫去
I strongly urge you to return to the White House.

284

我要跟我丈夫在一起
I'd prefer to stay with my husband.

285
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,007
您待在这里太显眼了
You're too exposed.

286
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:37,030
我不能有效地保护您
I can't effectively protect you.

287
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:39,027
在白宫里就会更安全了吗
Am I any safer at the White House?

288
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:40,064
我的政府
My administration

289
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:42,098
已经被彻底腐化了  比尔
Has been corrupted, Bill,

290
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:45,058
而你却告诉我  我们唯一的线索也快断了
And now you're telling me we're about to lose our only lead.

291
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:47,041
总统阁下  我保证在白宫里
Madam president, I assure you I've taken

292
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:49,048
会采取一切预防措施护驾
Every precaution to secure the White House.

293
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,089
现在那是最安全的地方
It's the safest place for you to be right now.

294
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:54,076
亨利的手术还得几个小时
Henry will be in surgery for several hours,

295
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:55,082
总统阁下
Madam president.

296
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:59,013
在这我们也是干着急
There's nothing more we can do here.

297
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,043
但是在总统办公室
You are needed

298
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,050
那里需要您
In the Oval Office.

299
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,094
好吧
All right.

300
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,097
我叫人把车发动着
I'll have the cars brought around.

301
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:14,068
同时让护送您女儿的车队改道去白宫
I'll also redirect your daughter's escorts to the White House.

302
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:17,041
谢谢你  比尔
Thank you, Bill.

303
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:24,018
下一步怎么办  伊桑
What are we going to do, Ethan?

304
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:26,069
如果我们都不知道谁值得信任
How can we possibly run this government

305
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,049
我们怎么才能让政府运作起来呢
When we don't know who we can trust?

306
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:30,002
我们只能祈祷杰克·鲍尔
We'll just have to pray Jack Bauer

307
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,033
能从杜马库那弄到那些名单

- To speak right now.  - this man has information vital

312
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,067
关系到国家安全  把他弄醒
To national security-- bring him around now.

313
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:47,081
快

一毫克肾上腺素

315
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,072
我知道你听得见  你现在已被逮捕

316

这些医生在抢救你

如果你不想死

318
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:04,089
就统统交代出
Tell me what I want to know. I want the names of everyone

319
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,066
你那些潜伏在政府里的同党
in the United States Government that you've been working with.

320
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,066
别装了
Come on.

321
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:10,026
你我都知道
You and I both know the game.

322
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,040
游戏已经结束了
It's over for you now.

323
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:13,047
没必要再去保护他们
There's no sense in trying to protect them.

324
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:17,034
你我都是军人

我知道你不怕死

327
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:23,004
你儿子还在桑加拉

我知道他在哪里

我发誓我会找到他  折磨他

都是他父亲的过错

除非你给我那些人的名字

00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,060
他的心跳停止了
He's going into cardiac arrest.

340
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:50,024
-快救活他  -电击板

给他开刀
Open him up.

356
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:13,073
先生  我们没时间了

00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,038
先生  不送他去医院
Sir, this man will die

360
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:37,012
这个人就会死掉

416
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:26,073
但我需要你帮忙  懂吗
Out of this, but I need your help, do you understand that?

417
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,003
听我说  好吗
Now, listen... okay?

418
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,004
奥布赖恩把文件下载后
As soon as O'Brian downloads those files,

419
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,050
我们就搞垮整个系统
We're gonna crash the entire system,

420
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:36,007
搞垮这层楼的每台服务器
Every single server on this floor.

421
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,061
天方夜谭
That's crazy.

422
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:39,078
不是天方夜谭
No, it's not crazy.

423
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:42,001
我们去主机房
We're gonna go up to the mainframe room...

424
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,065
开始系统格式化
Initiate a system-wide reformat.

425
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:45,075
清除一切信息
We'll wipe everything clean,

426
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:47,099
让他们没法阻止这一切
And they won't be able to stop it.

427
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:51,025
我们得绕过很多安全协议
We're gonna have to bypass a lot of safety protocols, okay?

428
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:52,082
但没有人
But nobody's better at dealing

429
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,043
比你更在行
With those servers than you are.

430
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:58,000
是吧
Isn't that true?

431
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,060
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

432
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,010
没有你不行
I can't do this without you.

433
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,074
艾丽卡
Erika?

434
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:16,078
好的
Okay.

435
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:22,029
我们得把...
We're gonna have to...

436
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:24,045
主机都联一起
Tie the main servers together.

437
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:27,042
我需要一块AVI主板
I need an AVI motherboard,

438
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:28,089
但你得重新配置下
But you're gonna have to reconfigure it

439
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,096
让它进行宏上链
For a macro uplink.

440
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,046
好  我们得快点
Okay, and we have to hurry.

441
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:33,080
那块磁盘很快就会送到这了
The drive is gonna be here any minute.

442
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:36,013
你去主机房开始行动
Go up to the mainframe room and get started.

443
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,027
我先去弄主板
I'm gonna prep the motherboard.

444
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,054
再去那里找你
I'll meet you up there.

445
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,057
好
Okay.

446
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:41,050
好
Okay.

447
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,094
一切会好起来的
We're gonna be fine.

448
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:48,088
我爱你
I love you.

449
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:53,018
我也是
I love you, too.

450
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:55,002
好  走吧
Okay, let's go. okay.

451
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:25,052
这些是玛丽卡·道诺索的私人物品
These are Marika Donoso's personal effects.

452
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:27,075
谢谢
Thank you.

453
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:28,092
好的
Copy that.

454
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,019
保持联系
Get back to me.

455
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:32,062
是拉里
That was Larry.

456
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,023
他们得到了磁盘
they got the drive

457
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,063
克罗伊在破解中
Chloe's gonna be working on them.

458
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,063
几分钟后就会有结果
They should have something in the next few minutes.

459
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,086
你就只关心这件事
That's all that matters,

460
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:40,053
对吗  杰克
Right, Jack?

461
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,040
我也不想看到
I don't like what happened to Marika

462
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,057
玛丽卡有什么不测
Any more than you do.

463
00:21:43,064 --> 00:21:44,084
我们已经尽力了
We did what was necessary.

464
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,027
你得想开点
You better figure out a way to live with it.

465
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:47,081
怎么想开  装作没发生过吗
How, Jack? Pretend that it never happened?

466
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:49,037
你就那么无动于衷吗
Is it that easy for you?

467
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,084
克罗伊一有消息
I'll let you know when

468
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:55,005
我会通知你
Chloe's got something.

469
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:05,022
磁盘在这里
Here it is.

470
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:11,000
这是PX-1-7磁盘
This is a PX-1-7 drive.

471
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:13,053
有自动擦除功能
It's got an auto-erase function.

472
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,097
我们只能下载一次
We've only got one download.

473
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:30,087
[检查载入的新数据中  检测到西格玛12加密模式]
Checking new data import. Encryption Sigma 12 dectected.

474
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,032
你去了哪里
Where have you been?

475
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,033
比我预计的时间长了些
Just took a little longer than I thought.

476
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,003
你在干什么
What are you doing?

477
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,081
查看监控录像  得盯着拉里和奥布赖恩
Checking surveillance. Got to keep an eye on Larry and O'Brian.

478
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,000
一旦我们下手
Once we do this, they're gonna

479
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:54,087
他们很快就会知道有人在这里捣鬼
Realize someone's up here in a few seconds.

480
00:22:54,094 --> 00:22:57,001
我们得为自己想好退路
We'll have to make a clean exit.

481
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:01,065
还要花多久
How much longer is this going to take?

482
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,058
我刚绕过安全协议
I just have to bypass safety protocols.

483
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,098
一旦通过验证
Once they're down,

484
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:08,072
我就开始直接格式化
I'll start the reformat.

485
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,019
说
Go ahead.

486
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,043
杜巴库还没到机场
Dubaku hasn't arrived at the airfield,

487
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,003
他没接电话
And he's not answering his cell phone.

488
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,090
-出了什么事了  -他被联调局抓到了
- What's going on?  - FBI got him.

489
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:18,036
什么
What?!

490
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:19,086
这件事你知道多久了
How long have you known about this?

491
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:21,080
他们不会从他那得到任何情报
They're not going to get anything out of him.

492
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:22,097
他在医院处于昏迷状态
He's unconscious in the hospital.

493
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:24,047
他们在追捕中出了车祸
There was a crash during a chase.

494
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:27,011
听着  联调局弄到了
Listen, the FBI recovered that database

495
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:28,081
你说过的那些名单
You told me about, the list of names.

496
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:30,021
我正在删除它
I'm in the process of deleting it.

497
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:31,084
不能留下蛛丝马迹
I'm going to erase every trace of it.

498
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:34,001
不用我说你也知道失败的后果
I don't have to tell you what will happen if they get that list.

499
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,081
不会的  名单的事由我来搞定
They won't. I'm gonna take care of the database.

500
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:37,045
你得搞定杜巴库
You need to take care of Dubaku.

501
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:40,005
-别操心他  你得确保  -可恶
- Don't worry about him. you just make sure...  - damn it!

502
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:41,059
我得挂了
I got to go.

503
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,092
出什么事了
What's wrong?

504
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:44,076
-这样不行  -怎么不行了
- It-it isn't working. - what do you mean, it isn't working?

505
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:46,026
指令输进去了
All the inputs are active,

506
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,053
服务器也联网了  但就是不能格式化
The servers are aligned, but the reformat won't start.

507
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,093
岂有此理
It doesn't make any sense.

508
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,036
好好想想  艾丽卡
Okay, well, just-just think it through, Erika.

509
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,023
-你行的  -你安静点行吗
- Right? you can do this.  - Would you just shut up?

510
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,030
好吗
Okay?

511
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:55,057
行
Okay.

512
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:57,074
一定是三号服务器的问题
Has to be server three.

513
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,014
三号服务器上周
All right, server three was upgraded

514
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,004
升级过
Last week.

515
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:04,024
也就是说他们把
Which means they restored

516
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:05,091
磁盘分区恢复到了系统默认状态
The partitions to the system default settings.

517
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:07,018
我怎么会这么蠢
How could I be so stupid?

518
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:14,015
只要重新设置下参数就行
I just have to configure the parameters.

519
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:17,002
好了
Okay.

520
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:24,030
好了吗  这样就行了吗
Okay? is that it?

521
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:27,053
是的
I think so.

522
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:30,080
程序在运行中
Program's running.

523
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:36,048
出什么事了
What? What's happening? What's going on?

524
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:38,024
-硬盘正被格式化  -什么
- The hard drive's reformatting.  - what?

525
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:40,041
文件正被删除中
The files are being erased.

526
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,035
信息全部丢失
We're losing everything.

527
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,018
让它停下来
Well, make it stop.

528
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,092
-我没权限  -卸载PX-1-7磁盘
- I don't have the access.  - Get the PX-1-7 out.

529
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:47,059
太晚了  数据已被擦除
It's too late. It's erased.

530
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,079
这是人为的  不是系统故障
This is deliberate. it's not a glitch.

531
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:53,032
有人想搞垮系统
Someone's trying to crash the system.

532
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,069
主机房在哪里
Where's your mainframe room?

533
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,013
跟我来
Come on.

534
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,070
他们过来了
Here they come.

535
00:25:01,077 --> 00:25:03,044
我们得离开这里
We got to get out of here.

536
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,060
-快完了  -艾丽卡
Almost there. Erika...

537
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:06,047
-完成了  -你确定吗
- It's done.  - Are you sure?

538
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:09,061
是的  还要几分钟才能完成格式化
Yeah. it'll take a few minutes for the reformat to be complete,

539
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:11,048
但已经没法阻止了
But there's no stopping it.

540
00:25:11,054 --> 00:25:12,064
好的  宝贝
Oh, baby.

541
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,045
我就知道你行
I knew you could do it.

542
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:17,028
我们没事了吧
Yeah. we gonna be okay?

543
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:19,035
没事了
We're gonna be fine.

544
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:52,018
对不起
Sorry.

545
00:26:14,054 --> 00:26:15,081
趴下
Get on the floor!

546
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:17,051
不是我干的
It wasn't me!

547
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:19,021
趴下
Get on the floor!

548
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,096
拉里  不是我干的
Larry, it wasn't me.

549
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:32,046
克罗伊
Chloe!

550
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:34,053
拉里  我跟她来到这里
Larry, I followed her up here.

551
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,063
是她想把系统搞崩溃
She was trying to crash the system.

552
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,006
她还开枪打我
She shot me!

553
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,040
我去夺枪  结果枪走火了
I went for the weapon, and it went off.

554
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:42,007
警卫  我是莫斯探员
Security, this is agent Moss.

555
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:43,064
派一队人过来封锁主机房
I need a team to lock down the mainframe room.

556
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,077
派个医生过来  克罗伊  你能恢复文件吗
And get a medic up here! Chloe, can you recover the files?

557
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:47,014
不知道
I don't know yet.

558
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:48,051
什么文件  出了什么事
What files?! what the hell is happening?!

559
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:50,027
你倒说说到底出了什么事  西恩
You tell me what the hell is happening, Sean!

560
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:53,014
你不让我参加行动  所以我就自己调查了
You were shutting me out, Larry, so I looked around on my own.

561
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:55,055
我发现艾丽卡在重新设定摄像头
I found out that Erika was rerouting the sub-cam channel!

562
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:57,032
她想干什么
What the hell was she doing?

563
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,005
她还对两个嫌犯乘坐的车发了通缉令
She sent out a-a warrant on a vehicle with two suspects.

564
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:01,029
我觉得不太对劲
I knew something was wrong.

565
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:02,079
这不是她的份内事
That's not part of her job.

566
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:04,046
我问过她  但她矢口否认
I asked her about it, and she tried to deny it.

567
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:06,049
她表现得很奇怪
She was acting very strangely.

568
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:07,059
你为什么不告发她
Why didn't you say anything?

569
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,023
我不清楚状况
I don't know what the hell it meant,

570
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,070
所以我侵入了她的硬盘
So I hacked into her hard drive,

571
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:12,053
发现了主服务器的结构图
And I found schematics for the main server.

572
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,057
安全协议的
Bypass codes

573
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:15,083
绕行指令
For the safety protocols.

574
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,010
我跟过来  看她究竟葫芦里卖的什么药
I followed her up here to see what she was up to.

575
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,091
我刚发现她要
The second I realized she was trying to crash

576
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,004
搞垮系统  就冲上去阻止她
The system, i-i confronted her.

577
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:25,041
她就开枪了
She shot me.

578
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:27,081
我去夺枪
I went for the gun.

579
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:29,065
拉里  我没想杀她
Larry, I didn't mean to kill her.

580
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:33,075
别动  别动
Halt! halt!

581
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:35,042
拉里  太晚了  系统已经完了
Larry, it's too late. the system's fried.

582
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:37,049
杜巴库的文件丢失了
Dubaku's files are gone.

583
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:39,019
你确定吗  不能再恢复了吗
Are you sure? can you recover anything?

584
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:41,049
服务器被删得一干二净  她得手了
The server's wiped clean. she got everything.

585
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,015
只有这些吗
Is this everything you got?

586
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,092
还不止
No, it's not.

587
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:03,049
我没时间打印出
I didn't have time to print out every single

588
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,006
艾丽卡机器上的所有消息
Message that came through Erika's workstation.

589
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:08,086
这只是她过去三天的活动
That's everything she was doing for the past three days.

590
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:11,006
听着  拉里
look, Larry,

591
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:12,023
我告诉过你事情的经过
I told you what happened.

592
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,080
我觉得你应该给我个解释
I feel like you owe me an explanation.

593
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:15,017
这里到底出了什么事
What the hell is going on here?

594
00:28:20,027 --> 00:28:23,044
政府里有人已被杜巴库收买
The government's been compromised by Dubaku.

595
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,011
联调局  特勤局
FBI, Secret Service.

596
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:26,061
天晓得还有谁
God knows who else.

597
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:28,071
所以我让克罗伊参与行动  而不是你
That's why I shut you out, brought in Chloe O'Brian.

598
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:30,065
我们正在破译一份文件
We were in the middle of decrypting a file

599
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:32,062
上面有为杜巴库卖命的人名单
That had the names of everyone on Dubaku's payroll.

600
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:34,085
艾丽卡格式化服务器时连名单一起删除了
Erika erased it when she wiped the server.

601
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,079
那是我们唯一的线索
That was our only lead.

602
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:38,069
你早该告诉我这些的
You should have told me about this.

603
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,006
你早该相信我
You should have trusted me.

604
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:42,093
西恩  我当时不知道该信谁
Sean, I didn't know who to trust.

605
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:46,073
你没事吧  胳膊怎么样
You all right? how's your arm?

606
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,013
很疼  但是我能挺得住
It hurts like hell. it's fine.

607
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,044
你稍作调整后  我们需要你帮忙
Oh. when you're up for it, I'm gonna need you

608
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,050
写份笔录
To write a statement.

609
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:52,077
好的
Okay.

610
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:53,094
你得守口如瓶
And keep your mouth shut.

611
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:56,058
局里还有谁为杜巴库工作
We don't know who else in this building

612
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:59,022
我们还不清楚  喂
Might be working for Dubaku. yeah.

613
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,048
拉里  别问我怎么弄的  但我竟成功了
Larry, don't ask me how, but I did it.

614
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:01,032
你成功什么了
You did what?

615
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,035
我修复了杜巴库的文档
I recovered Dubaku's files.

616
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,059
什么
What?

617
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:08,009
遇到敏感数据时
I was running a mirror file on an outside server.

618
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:09,056
我总会在一个外部服务器上
I always do that when I'm dealing

619
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:11,019
启动一个镜像文件
With sensitive materials.

620
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:13,029
艾丽卡的参数设置精密很难破译出来
Erika's parameters were too narrow to catch it.

621
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:15,029
需要多长时间破译
How soon can you have it decrypted?

622
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:17,040
已经破译好了  其实一直在破译中
It's decrypted. it's been decrypting this entire time.

623
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,023
杜巴库 记录了所有人为他效力的证据
Dubaku kept Detailed evidence on everyone.

624
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,000
电话记录  酬金记录  都在呢
Phone logs, financial records-- it's all here.

625
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:25,074
你马上对照下联调局的员工表
Listen, I'm gonna need you to cross-check with FBI personnel.

626
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,057
西恩说艾丽卡是独自为杜巴库卖命
Sean said Erika was working by herself,

627
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:29,041
但是我不能完全确认
But I got to be 100% sure.

628
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:30,068
好  等一下
Okay. hold on.

629
00:29:30,074 --> 00:29:32,075
好的
Yeah.

630
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:36,018
克洛伊修复了那些文件
Chloe recovered the files.

631
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,025
那太好了
That's great.

632
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:42,029
我该去做笔录了
I should get to that statement.

633
00:29:42,036 --> 00:29:44,029
好
Yeah.

634
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:46,033
西恩
Sean?

635
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,006
等你做完笔录
When you're done there,

636
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:49,040
就下楼去见韦伯医生
I want you to go downstairs and see Dr. Weber.

637
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:51,053
你开枪击中了同事
You shot a fellow agent.

638
00:29:51,053 --> 00:29:53,093
你得跟心理医生谈谈
You're gonna want to talk to somebody.

639
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,020
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

640
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,090
知道服务器 到底怎么了吗
Hey, do you have any idea What's going on with the servers?

641
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,000
不清楚
Not a clue.

642
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:16,017
整个系统都崩溃了
The whole system's down.

643
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:20,011
我想进主机房 保安不让进
I tried to get into the mainframe room, And security has got it locked off.

644
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,061
去问拉里吧  詹尼斯
Ask Larry about it, Janis.

645
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:23,021
你去哪
Where are you going?

646
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:25,011
我有任务在身
I got to run an errand.

647
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:27,092
现在吗
Now?

648
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,082
希林格探员  别动
Agent Hillinger. Dont't move.

649
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:02,072
好吧  好吧
All right, all right.

650
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,079
慢着
Hold off.

651
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:09,006
马上给我交代
You better start talking to me right now!

652
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:14,016
我要找律师
I'd like to speak with my attorney.

653
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:21,017
把他给我关到审讯室去
Put him in holding.

654
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:32,098
给我接白宫的比尔·布坎南
Get me Bill Buchanan at the White House.

655
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:47,040
我妹妹呢
Where is my sister?

656
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:49,067
玛丽卡呢
Where's Marika?

657
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,030
出了场车祸
There was an accident.

658
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,010
出什么事了
What happened?

659
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:57,011
玛丽卡死了
Marika didn't make it.

660
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:59,014
你  你什么意思
What-what do you mean?

661
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,031
她出了交通事故
There was a crash.

662
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,021
是在追捕过程中
Uh, it happened during the pursuit.

663
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:05,045
玛丽卡意外身亡
Marika was killed.

664
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:09,022
我不明白
I don't understand.

665
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,029
你说过要保护她的
You said that you'd protect her.

666
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:12,079
你说她会没事的
You said she'd be okay.

667
00:32:12,086 --> 00:32:15,002
没有玛丽卡的帮助  我们就抓不到杜巴库
We wouldn't have caught Dubaku without Marika's help.

668
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:18,036
她很勇敢  真的很勇敢  罗莎
She was very, very brave, Rosa.

669
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:21,040
这是什么
What is this?

670
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:23,060
给我这个  就没事了吗
This is supposed to make everything okay?

671
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:27,054
玛丽卡是我的全部
Marika was all I had!

672
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,001
我把她的命交给你  你就这么让她死了
I trusted you with her life, and you let her die?!

673
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:32,047
真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

674
00:32:32,058 --> 00:32:34,021
别碰我
Don't touch me!

675
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:39,051
你害死了我妹
You killed my sister!

676
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:42,049
你根本不在乎自己的行事手段
You didn't care how you did it

677
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:43,059
也不在乎谁会受到伤害
or who got hurt!

678
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:50,056
沃克探员
Agent Walker?

679
00:32:55,043 --> 00:32:57,043
失陪一下
Excuse me.

680
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:05,081
我刚跟拉里通了电话
I just got off the phone with Larry.

681
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:07,034
杜巴库没撒谎
Dubaku wasn't lying.

682
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,068
硬盘上存着所有政府内
On the drive was a list

683
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:10,068
为他卖命的人的名单
Of everyone he was working with in the government.

684
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:12,068
已经准备好抓捕那些人了
They're getting ready to make arrests.

685
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,075
都结束了
It's over.

686
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:19,092
罗莎还在纠结
It's not over for Rosa.

687
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:25,086
玛丽卡的死  是个悲剧
What happened to Marika was a tragedy.

688
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:27,053
但是我不会站在这告诉你
But I'm not going to stand here

689
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,000
我们做错了  因为我们没有错
And tell you what we did was wrong, because we weren't.

690
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,067
她做出了自己的抉择  一个勇敢的抉择
She made a choice, a brave one,

691
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:33,043
她参与了行动  并且她成功了
To get involved, but she made it.

692
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,090
天哪  听听你都在说些什么  杰克
God, listen to yourself, Jack.

693
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,074
你一点人性都没有
You don't even sound human.

694
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,017
你就一点感觉也没有吗
Don't you feel anything?

695
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:39,051
我们是职责所在
We had a job to do!

696
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,078
我们的职责就是
To protect the hundreds if not

697
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,084
保护成千上万的无辜生命
Thousands of innocent lives

698
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:43,008
如果我们不那样做  一旦恐怖袭击发生了
That would not have had a choice

699
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:46,018
那些人  还有的选吗
If we let a terrorist attack take place.

700
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,065
我们没有做错
What we did wasn't wrong.

701
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:50,089
我们这样做  很有必要
It was necessary.

702
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:54,009
我看过你的档案
I read your file.

703
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:56,019
你老婆被杀的时候  你会心痛吗
When your wife was killed, did you feel that

704
00:33:56,026 --> 00:33:58,006
还是只是告诉你自己  这也是必要的
Or did you just tell yourself that that was necessary?

705
00:33:58,013 --> 00:34:00,040
你要我怎么样呢
What do you want from me?

706
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:01,060
你到底要我怎么做
What do you want from me?!

707
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,093
我只是想知道  你现在也感到悲痛
I just want to know that you feel something!

708
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,023
就像我一样  痛彻心扉
I want to know that you feel the same kind of pain that I do!

709
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,004
你能感觉到吗
Do you feel that?!

710
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,060
你能感觉到吗
Do you feel that?!

711
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:19,068
没事了
It's all right.

712
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:24,065
你会没事的
You're going to be all right.

713
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:29,042
只是需要点时间
It's going to take a while.

714
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,046
你最终会学会忍受这种痛苦的
But you will learn to live with it.

715
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:34,003
如果我不想学会忍受呢
What if I don't want to learn to live with it?

716
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,007
那就放弃吧
Then quit.

717
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:41,040
还有
And by the way,

718
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:43,004
你在车边救人时表演的绝技
That stunt you pulled by the car...

719
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:47,051
下次再拿枪指着我时
...you ever pull your weapon on me again,

720
00:34:47,058 --> 00:34:50,001
你最好真想一枪打死我
You better intend to use it.

721
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:51,035
我真想
I did.

722
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,081
奥利维亚
Olivia.

723
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,091
怎么回事
What's going on?

724
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:26,078
我爸爸怎么样了
How's dad?

725
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:30,025
他还在做手术
He's still in surgery.

726
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:31,091
我们还在等消息
We're waiting for word.

727
00:35:31,098 --> 00:35:34,045
他会转危为安吧
Is he going to be all right?

728
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:36,045
他伤得很重
He was seriously injured.

729
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:38,039
子弹
The bullet

730
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:40,046
穿透了他的肺部
Went through his lung.

731
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:44,013
利维
Livy.

732
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,046
医生们
The doctors are doing

733
00:35:46,053 --> 00:35:48,046
在全力抢救
Everything they can.

734
00:35:48,053 --> 00:35:50,050
谁干的
Who did this?

735
00:35:52,054 --> 00:35:53,097
一言难尽啊
It's complicated.

736
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:57,047
我要知道  是谁向我爸爸开的枪
I want to know who shot my father!

737
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:01,024
你爸爸发现了
Your father found out about a conspiracy

738
00:36:01,031 --> 00:36:03,004
政府内部的一个阴谋
Inside the government.

739
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:05,061
于是那些幕后黑手想杀他灭口
The people behind it tried to kill him.

740
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:06,065
是些什么人
Who are these people?

741
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:08,098
我们目前仍在调查中
We're trying to find out right now.

742
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:11,002
我只能告诉你这么多了
That's all I can tell you.

743
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:13,029
好吧  我要去医院
Okay, I want to go to the hospital.

744
00:36:13,036 --> 00:36:14,062
他醒过来的时候
I want to be there

745
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:16,063
-我要他看见我  -不能去
When he wakes up. I can't let you do that.

746
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:18,099
拿枪打你爸爸的人仍然逍遥法外
The people who shot your father are still out there.

747
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:21,063
我不管  我要见爸爸
I don't care, I want to see dad!

748
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,027
不许犟嘴
This is not a debate.

749
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:25,013
我不能让你再出什么事了
I'm not going to risk anything happening to you.

750
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,017
你在白宫里老实待着
You're staying in the White House,

751
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:28,017
就这样吧
And that's the end of it.

752
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:30,087
总统阁下  比尔·布坎南来见您了
Madam president, Bill Buchanan is here to see you.

753
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:32,087
我马上出来
I'll be right out.

754
00:36:36,078 --> 00:36:39,025
我们还有很多事要谈  奥利维亚
There's a lot we need to talk about, Olivia.

755
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:43,055
好多事情  不能再漠视下去了
We've been ignoring things for far too long.

756
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:47,079
爸爸中了枪  你才想起来跟我谈
It took dad getting shot for you to finally want to talk?

757
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:49,092
我们别再无休止地争吵下去了
Let's not go down this path.

758
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:53,040
真的不该再吵了
Not again.

759
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,046
也不该在今天吵
Not today.

760
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:59,027
待会儿我们再谈
We'll talk later.

761
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:02,034
警卫会带你去房间
One of the guards will take you up to the residence.

762
00:37:12,092 --> 00:37:14,035
比尔  什么事情
All right, Bill. what is it?

763
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:16,035
好消息
I have very good news.

764
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,049
杰克·鲍尔
Jack Bauer just

765
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:19,049
刚恢复了一个杜巴库隐藏的数据库
Recovered a database hidden on Dubaku.

766
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:20,086
政府里为他卖命的人的名单
It contains the names of everyone

767
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:22,016
都在里面
In the government who was working with him.

768
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,019
有多少人
How many?

769
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:24,086
接近百人
Close to a hundred people,

770
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,076
包括所有的单位
Across all agencies.

771
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,060
-其中一些还是位高权重的  -天哪
- Some at very high levels. - My god.

772
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:31,000
杜巴库保存了所有人的详细资料
Dubaku kept detailed files on every person.

773
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:32,033
这正是
This is exactly

774
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,057
我们想要的  总统阁下
What we've been working toward, Madam president.

775
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:34,060
阴谋
We can finally put an end

776
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:36,071
终于可以结束了
To this conspiracy.

777
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:38,074
我想你已经
I assume you've already

778
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:40,084
-针对这些情报展开行动了吧  -是的
- Begun acting on this information. - Yes.

779
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,051
事实上  拉里·莫斯刚刚又揪出来两个
As a matter of fact, Larry Moss just identified two more individuals

780
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:45,065
在联调局的内鬼  也在名单之上
Working within FBI who were on the list.

781
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:48,065
他确信联调局已经安全了
He's confident the Bureau is secure.

782
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:49,098
下一步怎么办
What's the next step?

783
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:52,082
我在跟联调局联手做一次内部大搜捕
I'm working with FBI to coordinate an interagency sweep.

784
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,082
一小时内  就可以开始抓人了
We should start making arrests within the hour.

785
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:56,076
比尔  我真不知道该说
Bill, I don't know what to say

786
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,009
什么感谢的话才好
To thank you.

787
00:37:58,016 --> 00:37:59,093
你今天所做的一切
What you have done here today

788
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,060
我们会没齿难忘
Puts all of us in your debt.

789
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,096
谢谢夸奖  总统阁下
I appreciate that, Madam president,

790
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:05,097
但是我们还有许多人要感谢
But there are a lot of people to thank,

791
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:07,077
包括杰克·鲍尔
Including Jack Bauer.

792
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:12,074
他将会在明天早晨
He's scheduled to resume his testimony

793
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,041
参议院的听证会上出庭受审
Before the senate committee tomorrow morning.

794
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:16,001
这点我很清楚
I'm aware of that.

795
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:17,028
总统阁下  恕我冒昧
Madam president, forgive me

796
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:19,001
也许我说话有点过分
If I'm out of line, but I feel

797
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,005
但是我感觉  迈尔参议员
Senator mayer is on a personal crusade

798
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:22,092
有些针对杰克
Against Jack.

799
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,092
他已得偿所愿  也该得饶人处且饶人了
He's already taken his pound of flesh.

800
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,076
他解散了反恐组
He dismantled CTU,

801
00:38:26,082 --> 00:38:27,092
毁掉了那些曾为这个国家
Attacked the reputations of people

802
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,029
鞠躬尽瘁的人们的名誉
Who've served this country with honor.

803
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:32,076
如今  他又想拿杰克来杀鸡儆猴
Now he wants to make an example of Jack.

804
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,076
这样做是不对的  总统阁下
It isn't right, Madam president,

805
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,063
尤其是看到今天杰克的表现
Especially after today.

806
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,090
你要我怎么做呢  比尔
What are you asking me to do, Bill?

807
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:41,017
我想让您跟迈尔参议员谈谈
I'm asking you to speak to senator mayer.

808
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:44,077
杰克·鲍尔帮我们拯救了这个国家
Jack Bauer helped save this country.

809
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:47,084
不该让他在监狱里度过余生
He doesn't deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison.

810
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,041
我很欣赏你的观点  比尔
I appreciate your sentiments, Bill,

811
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:54,035
但请容我再斟酌一下
But I'm going to have to think about this.

812
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,062
我已别无他求  总统阁下
That's all I'm  asking, Madam president.

813
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:57,085
谢谢您
Thank you.

814
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,029
你来这干嘛
What the hell are you doing here?

815
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,019
-我得跟你谈谈  -谈什么
- I need to talk with you. - About what?

816
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,083
我告诉过你  我在追踪一条线索
I told you I was going to follow up on a lead.

817
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:39,003
不  你说过这件事情一完
No, you said you were going to turn yourself in

818
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,006
-你就会投案自首  -我会的
- As soon as this was over. - And I will.

819
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:44,023
但是这事情还没完
But this ain't over yet.

820
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,000
还会有恐怖袭击
There's going to be another attack.

821
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,005
就在这里  在华盛顿
Here in D.C.

822
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:48,097
杜巴库已经被羁押  他已经供出了
Dubaku is in custody. he's already provided us

823
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:50,071
在政府里为他卖命的所有人的名单
With a list of everyone in the government that was working with him.

824
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:52,071
这次不是杜巴库
It's not Dubaku.

825
00:39:52,078 --> 00:39:55,048
是他老板  朱玛
It's his boss, Juma.

826
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:58,065
他知道他即将失去对自己国家的控制权了
He knows he's about to lose control of his country.

827
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:00,098
所以他企图召集他手下的亡命徒
So he's going to try and rally his people behind him

828
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:03,002
-合力反击我国  -你是怎么知道的
- By striking back at the U.S. - How do you know this?

829
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,002
我追查到一个情报来源
I tracked down a source.

830
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:07,002
什么情报来源
What source?

831
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:10,002
我曾和他共同为爱默生团伙卖命
He was one of the men I worked with on emerson's crew.

832
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:12,019
他能跟在桑加拉的朱玛政权
He had a direct line of communication

833
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:15,020
进行直接联络
With the Juma regime in Sangala.

834
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:18,020
从他那得到情报不太容易
It wasn't easy getting the information out of him,

835
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:20,054
但我确信情报可靠

836
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,054
-那你应该向联调局报告  -不
- Then you should hand it over to FBI. - No.

837

839

840
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:30,004
繁文缛节的官文程序
Wades through their procedures and red tape,

841
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,011
一切就太迟了
It's going to be too late.

842
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,012
袭击目标是什么
What's the target?

843
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:38,012
他不清楚具体的目标
He doesn't know the exact target,

844
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,009
但目标绝对是攻击价值高

845
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:43,016
破坏后负面效应大的

他给了我一个名字

莱恩·伯内特

850
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,081
是的
That's right.

851
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,047
从一开始  他就参与其中
He's been involved from the very beginning.

852
00:40:59,054 --> 00:41:00,081
迈尔呢
What about Mayer?

853
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:02,001
没

他没参与

855
00:41:03,035 --> 00:41:05,011
你确定吗
You're sure about that?

856
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:07,018
确定
Yeah.

857
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:11,002
你最好是没跟我撒谎  托尼
You better not be lying to me, Tony.

858
00:41:13,006 --> 00:41:15,009
千真万确  杰克
This is real, Jack.

859
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:21,006
伯内特会在杜巴库的名单上找到

860
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:23,040
只要他发现杜巴库被羁押
As soon as he finds out that Dubaku's in custody,

861
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,040
他会马上逃之夭夭  你没多少时间了
He'll start running. you don't have a lot of time.

让大家久等了
