《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,022
我去去就回
I'll be right back.

5
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:22,078
蕾妮
Renee!

6
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:23,097
蕾妮
Renee!

7
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,037
天哪
Oh, God...

8
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:32,081
你说你有一份视频文件能证明
You said you had video file implicating people inside

9
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:34,084
杀害蕾妮的是俄罗斯政府里的人
the Russian government who were responsible for Renee's murder.

10
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:36,081
我要那份文件
I want that file.

11
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:39,000
告诉我文件在哪  快说
You're gonna tell me where that file is, now!

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,055
在一个银行保险箱里
It's in a safety deposit box!

13
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:41,045
在哪
Where?

14
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:42,085
第一联合储蓄
First Unity Savings.

15
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:45,009
蕾妮的死跟我一点关系都没有  杰克
I had nothing to do with Renee's death, Jack.

16
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,032
别动
No.

17
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,016
你还想耍花招  不是吗
You never give up, do you?

18
00:00:58,077 --> 00:01:00,027
也许沃什就在鲍尔手里
Bauer may have Walsh,

19
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:01,060
但他还没拿到证据
but he can't have the evidence yet.

20
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,060
我们还有机会阻止他
We've still got a chance to stop him.

21
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,064
不止我一人有证据证明
I'm not the only one who can prove that elements

22
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:09,054
贵国政府内有人阴谋破坏和平进程
in your government conspired to undermine the peace process.

23
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,037
所以你希望我来替你干掉杰克·鲍尔
So you expect me to kill Bauer for you?

24
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:14,038
你有专干这行的秘密杀手
You have the covert assets here to do the job.

25
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:16,011
或许我是有
Maybe I do.

26
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:18,058
但我没有相关资源来找到并跟踪他
But I don't have the resources to find him.

27
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:19,065
反恐小组有
CTU does.

28
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:22,066
而且那里负责搜捕的人现在都归我管
And the man in charge of the search now reports to me.

29
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,083
我们发现他了
We got him.

30
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:27,068
一旦他们抓到鲍尔
Once they have Bauer,

31
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,074
我就会得知他们把他关在哪里
I'll find out where they're holding him.

32
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:30,099
我们趁着他被关押干掉他
You'll have to take him out while he's in custody.

33
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:32,064
站住  警察
Freeze! Police!

34
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,059
不许动
Do not move.

35
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,078
杰克  告诉我  我还能做什么
Jack... tell me what I can do.

36
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,048
用不着
Nothing.

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,006
以下事件发生于中午十二点到一点间
The following takes place between 12:00 P.M. and 1:00 P.M.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,021
蒙德  我是沃莱基队长
Mund, this is Captain Walleki.

45
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,037
我在现场  你把那人从银行带过来了吗
I'm on scene. You got that guy from the bank yet?

46
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,091
报告队长  我正带他上来
Just bringing him up, Captain.

47
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,092
好的
Right.

48
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,003
他叫科尔·奥迪斯
His name's Cole Ortiz.

49
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,090
他说他是反恐小组的
And he says he's with CTU.

50
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:42,027
你当时和这个女人在银行
You were with this woman at the bank.

51
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:44,019
你能告诉我她是谁吗
You can tell me who she is?

52
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:52,088
她叫丹娜·沃什
Her name is Dana Walsh.

53
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,088
她被近距离射中两枪
Shot twice at close range

54
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,092
其中一枪  近弹孔处留有大量弹药残留物
lot of powder residue around one of the entries,

55
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,068
就像是被执行了死刑一样
like an execution.

56
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:02,050
谢了  蒙德  带他去反恐小组
Thank you, Mund. Get him to CTU,

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,011
现在就去
now.

58
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:22,034
刺杀哈桑的行动已万事俱备
The hit on Hassan is all arranged.

59
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,074
巴扎耶夫及其手下正在处理一切
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.

60
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:27,004
很高兴听到这些
Well, I'm pleased to hear it,

61
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,095
但你打个电话告诉我不就行了
but you could have just as easily called to tell me that.

62
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,082
我想知道你是否已向上级请示
I wanted to know if you've spoken to your superiors...

63
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,029
这事一完我就金盆洗手了
told them that I'm out after this goes down.

64
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:41,016
我反映了你的要求
I told them what you wanted.

65
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,062
他和我的感受一样
He feels the same as me:

66
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:46,007
我们对你投入太多  不能让你就此退出
we have too much invested in you to let you walk away.

67
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:49,092
你应专注于把电磁脉冲设备带进反恐小组
You should be focused on getting the E.M.P. device into CTU,

68
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:52,083
而不是你的男友奥迪斯
not on your boyfriend, Ortiz.

69
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:56,031
他是我的未婚夫  我说了别把他卷进来
He's my fiance, and I told you to leave him out of this.

70
00:03:56,037 --> 00:04:01,034
我警告过你离他远点  但你不听
I warned you to stay away from him, but you didn't listen.

71
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,095
现在你对他动真情了吗
And now you think you have feelings for him?

72
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:07,072
你觉得你爱上他了  要嫁给他吗
You think you love him, going to marry him?

73
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:09,079
是的
Yes.

74
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,059
我要嫁给他
I am.

75
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:16,016
如果你无法接受这个事实的话
And if you have a problem wrapping your brain around that fact,

76
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:20,010
也许我该找你莫斯科的头儿谈谈
maybe I should talk to your boss in Moscow.

77
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,090
你只能和我单线联系
You talk to no one but me.

78
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:27,020
就此打住
We're done here.

79
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:31,051
哈桑死之前不许再联系我
Don't contact me again until Hassan is dead.

80
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,010
喂
Yeah?

81
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,056
是我  给你发了一个dat格式的视频
Hey, it's me. I sent you a DAT video file.

82
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,091
收到了  正在上传
I got it. It's uploading right now.

83
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,028
我需要你帮我查出视频中那名男子的身份
Okay, I need you to get me an I.D. of the man in the video.

84
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,011
另外  我在逃亡中
Also, I'm coming in hot,

85
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:59,034
你必须想尽办法避免暴露你的系统
so whatever you have to do to protect your systems from getting flagged, do it now.

86
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,069
那个女人呢  也需要查明身份吗
What about the woman? You need an I.D. on her?

87
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,059
她已经死了  一会儿见
She's dead. I'll see you in a few minutes.

88
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,059
好吧
All right.

89
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:07,068
杰克·鲍尔最后出现在
Jack Bauer's last known location

90
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,081
莱克星敦市的第一联合储蓄银行
was First Unity Savings Bank on Lexington,

91
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:13,032
警方收到报警  显然是丹娜·沃什打的
where police responded to a 911 call, apparently from Dana Walsh.

92
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,002
现在她死了  鲍尔杀了她
She's dead now. Bauer killed her.

93
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:19,063
从犯科尔·奥迪斯协助了鲍尔
Cole Ortiz, who is known to be aiding and abetting Bauer

94
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:21,054
他正被带过来接受审讯
is being brought here for questioning.

95
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,064
现在我需要大家别再管联合国安全事务了
Now, I need everybody not committed to the U.N. Security task

96
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,064
集中全部精力找到鲍尔
to devote their full attention to finding him.

97
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,004
我需要对所有的摄像头画面进行面部识别
I want all cameras routed through facial recognition

98
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,077
并监听所有的电话
and all phone calls monitored.

99
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:31,072
要是带宽不够
You don't have the bandwidth,

100
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,027
就从别的任务那里腾出来用
you steal it from other tasks.

101
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:36,080
要是发现任何线索  立刻向我汇报
If you think you have a lead, you bring it to me immediately.

102
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,073
有问题吗
Any questions?

103
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:39,084
他们为什么要去银行
Why did they go to the bank?

104
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,031
丹娜说过她有俄罗斯人刺杀哈桑的证据
Dana said she had evidence of Russian involvement in Hassan's murder.

105
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,001
也许她就把证据藏到那了
Maybe that's where she was stashing it.

106
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:47,051
根本没有证据  这一点总统已不予考虑
There's no evidence; the president dismissed this.

107
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:50,085
但她带着杰克去银行是为了去取东西
Well, she went to the bank with Jack to get something.

108
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:53,005
没错  她取的是个爆炸装置
Yeah, what she got was an explosive device

109
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,083
此装置能让她趁机逃跑
that made possible her escape.

110
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,023
这自始至终就是她设计好了的
It was her plan all along.

111
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,094
听着  杰克·鲍尔不能接受
Look, Jack Bauer can't accept the fact

112
00:05:58,094 --> 00:06:01,015
仅丹娜·沃什一人为伊斯兰共和国中
that Dana Walsh was an enemy agent working solely

113
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,088
哈桑政府的反对派们卖命这一事实
with the I.R.K. opposition to Hassan's government.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,022
蕾妮·沃克的被害让他悲痛至极
His... grief over Renee Walker's murder

115
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:10,051
导致他胡思乱想  认为这是俄当局的阴谋
is causing him to create this fantasy about a Russian conspiracy.

116
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:13,015
事实就这么简单  他失去了理智
The simple truth is, he's lost it,

117
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:16,005
他不仅危及自身  还危及整个社区
and he's a danger to himself and the community.

118
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:18,074
所以大家别再对本次行动充当事后诸葛了
So let's stop second-guessing the operation,

119
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,025
还是赶紧找到他吧
and find him.

120
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,083
事情越发不对劲了
Something is seriously wrong here.

121
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,037
皮勒正无视最关键的问题
Pillar's ignoring the key questions,

122
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,073
他根本就是在答非所问
and the questions that he is answering, no one's asking.

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,004
你想说什么
What are you getting at?

124
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,027
我认为杰克是对的
I think Jack's right:

125
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,021
这是个试图隐瞒真相的阴谋  皮勒也有份
this is a cover-up, and Pillar's involved.

126
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:40,021
银行里确实有证据  现在杰克拿到了
That evidence was at the bank, and Jack has it.

127
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:41,004
你敢确定吗
You don't know that.

128
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:45,025
都是猜测而已  可能事情就像皮勒说的那样
It's all speculation. It may be just like Pillar says.

129
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,051
除非我知道其它情况  否则我只按命令行事
Until I know otherwise, I got my orders.

130
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,088
没被发现
I'm clear.

131
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,082
你刚没开玩笑
Well, you weren't kidding.

132
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,042
你确实在逃亡中
You said you were coming in hot.

133
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,046
所有的警用步话机里都在讨论你
All the police scanners are talking about you.

134
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,089
他们说你射杀了一个女人
They said you shot and killed some woman.

135
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:02,010
就在东部贫民区的一个建筑工地
Construction site on the East Side.

136
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:03,073
是你发给我的视频里的那个女人吗
Is that the same woman in the video you sent me?

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,030
没错  查出那男人的身份了吗
Yeah. Did you I.D. the man?

138
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:08,017
没有  除非你告诉我到底发生什么了
No. I'm not going to, either...

139
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,097
否则我不帮你查他的身份  杰克
till you tell me what the hell is going on, Jack.

140
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,017
你看过那段视频了
You saw the video.

141
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:13,061
丹娜·沃什是俄罗斯间谍
Dana Walsh is a Russian operative.

142
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:17,010
她协助了此次暗杀哈桑总统行动和核弹袭击事件
She facilitated the assassination of President Hassan and the dirty bomb attack

143
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,011
要是我们没及时阻止  整个上西区都将被夷为平地
that would have wiped out the entire Upper West Side if we hadn't stopped it.

144
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:23,010
我不关心也不想知道今天发生什么了
I don't want to know about what happened today, and I don't care;

145
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,090
我想知道为何你一个人单枪匹马
I want to know why you're out there on your own

146
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,030
为什么大家都在抓你
and why everybody's after you.

147
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,008
因为总统想把我关起来
Because the president tried to lock me down.

148
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,083
-为什么  -因为我知道她试图掩盖
- Why?  - Because I know she's trying to cover up

149
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,023
今天的袭击与俄方有关这一真相
the Russian's involvement in today's attack.

150
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,097
那你干嘛不逃之夭夭
Then why didn't you disappear?

151
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,017
因为我办不到
Because I can't!

152
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:40,004
听着  杰克  我想帮你
Listen, I want to help you, Jack.

153
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,028
真的想
I really do.

154
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:43,048
我要你对我开诚布公
I need you to be straight with me.

155
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:45,095
实话告诉我到底发生什么了
Tell me exactly what's going on.

156
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,073
俄罗斯人夺走了我的所爱
The Russians took something from me.

157
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:04,037
她叫蕾妮·沃克
Her name was Renee Walker.

158
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:07,045
他们就在我的公寓里杀害了她
They killed her inside my apartment.

159
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,057
我要让他们血债血偿
And I need to make them pay.

160
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:19,005
好吧
All right.

161
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:23,072
事实上  我确实查出了那个人的身份
Actually, I did I.D. the guy.

162
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:28,096
就是他  帕维尔·托卡列夫
There he is: Pavel Tokarev.

163
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:34,011
俄情报部门首席特工
Primary operative, Russian intelligence.

164
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,078
他现在在哪
Where is he?

165
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,079
具体我也不清楚
I don't know exactly.

166
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:43,042
目前在美国境内
He's in the USA.

167
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,089
一月以前靠外交签证入境的
Came in a month ago on a diplomatic visa.

168
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:47,040
外交签证  
Diplomat.

169
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,029
我试图访问俄大使馆的数据库
I tried to access the Russian database in the embassy.

170
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,026
他没在领事馆出现过
He didn't show up in the consulate.

171
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,083
所以说不好他在哪  杰克
He could be anywhere, Jack.

172
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:57,041
为保密起见  他们必须得小队行动对吧
To keep everything quiet, they'd have to be a small unit, right?

173
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,085
对
Yeah.

174
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:01,044
我有办法了
I think I've got an idea.

175
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,027
给我接条安全线路
Get me a secure line.

176
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:07,048
梅瑞狄斯  没想到你还在这
Meredith. I didn't expect you'd still be here.

177
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:11,025
还有几个关于哈桑的新闻发布稿要审校
Oh, fact check called: there are a few items left on the Hassan piece.

178
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:12,093
艾比可以帮你继续跟进报道啊
Abby can follow up on it for you.

179
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,092
我知道  只是...我想确保一切都没问题
I know. I just... I need to make sure it's right.

180
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:19,089
我知道他对你很重要
I know what he meant to you.

181
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:22,033
从你写的这篇文章就看得出来
It shows in this piece you wrote.

182
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,046
他的确是个伟人
What a great man he was.

183
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:27,006
你已经还他公正了
You've done him justice.

184
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,067
希望如此
I hope so.

185
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:33,077
-里德小姐  3号线有你的电话  -谢谢
- Miss Reed, there's a call for you on 3. - Thank you.

186
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:36,023
如有何需要  请尽管告诉我
Let me know if there's anything you need.

187
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,034
谢谢  加里
Thanks, Gary.

188
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:50,035
我是梅瑞狄斯·里德
This is Meredith Reed.

189
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,042
里德小姐
Miss Reed.

190
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,046
-你是谁  -我叫杰克·鲍尔
-Who is this? -My name is Jack Bauer.

191
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:55,019
请别声张  听我说
Please don't say anything; just listen.

192
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:57,038
那些你认为该对哈桑总统的死负责的人
The people that you think are responsible for killing President Hassan

193
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,083
他们不是单打独斗
were not working alone.

194
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,030
他们得到俄当局内部人士的资助
They were being funded and managed

195
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,007
并受他们操纵
by people working inside the Russian government.

196
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:03,074
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

197
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:05,061
我有证据  是打入反恐组内部的
I have proof of this: a video file that was made

198
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:07,022
俄方间谍留下的一个视频文件
by a Russian agent working out of CTU.

199
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,080
她做这文件的初衷是为求自保
She made it for her own protection.

200
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,098
视频可以解释过去24小时发生的一切
It explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours.

201
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:12,086
你和当局取得联系了吗
Have you contacted the authorities about any of this?

202
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:15,062
我不能去  我被人陷害了  就像你昨天一样
I can't. I'm being set up, just like you were yesterday.

203
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,052
我得把这证据交给你
I need to get this evidence to you.

204
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,003
特纳百货公司3楼  有一间咖啡厅
There's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store.

205
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,086
你看20分钟内你能赶到吗
Do you think you can get there in the next 20 minutes?

206
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:24,056
里德小姐
Miss Reed...

207
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:26,077
昨天是我帮你洗脱了罪名
yesterday I helped clear your name.

208
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,057
现在该你帮我洗清冤屈了
Right now I need you to help clear mine.

209
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:30,077
拜托了
Please.

210
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:33,011
我当然会帮你
Of course I'll help you.

211
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:35,094
我也和你一样迫切想要了解真相
I-I want to know the truth as much as you do.

212
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,054
谢谢
Thank you.

213
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,036
谢谢
Thank you.

214
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:59,083
请坐
Take a seat.

215
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,024
鲍尔在哪
Where's Bauer?

216
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,034
不知道
I don't know.

217
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,048
你现在麻烦大了  科尔
You're in some trouble here, Cole.

218
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:12,081
我想你应该清楚
I assume you're aware of that.

219
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,005
不过幸运的是
Luckily for you,

220
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:17,012
我能解决你所有的麻烦
I'm in a position to make all that go away.

221
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,082
我看过你的档案
I reviewed your record.

222
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,029
到目前为止  简直可以说是模范
You've had a exemplary career up to now.

223
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:23,086
你就是皮勒
You're Pillar.

224
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:25,039
没错
That's right.

225
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:26,059
杰森·皮勒
Jason Pillar.

226
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:30,003
我受命于总统  负责监督缉捕杰克的行动
I've been asked by the president to oversee the effort to retrieve Jack Bauer.

227
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,040
总统阁下
Madam President?

228
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:32,000
对
Yes.

229
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:34,080
这么说你也是帮忙掩盖真相的
So you're a part of the cover-up?

230
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,061
我看到档案里写道  你在费卢杰服过役
Oh, I see here you served in Fallujah.

231
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,071
我本人也曾两度
I-I spent two tours

232
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,018
指挥过驻巴古拜的海军陆战队行动小组
in command of a marine unit in Baquba myself.

233
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,075
我们都是军人
We're both soldiers.

234
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:51,047
所以你应该明白  当最高统帅
So you understand, when the commander-in-chief

235
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:54,012
认为此次行动是为了国家利益
deems a course of action necessary to the national good,

236
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,016
那我们就无权质疑
it's not our place to question it.

237
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:59,099
事实上  我们是同一阵营的
The truth is: we're on the same side.

238
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,030
我们都是为了国家至高利益考虑
We both want what's best for our country.

239
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:03,066
鲍尔才不关心那些
Bauer doesn't care about that.

240
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:05,063
他对你的遭遇也丝毫不在乎
He didn't give a damn about what happened to you,

241
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,090
只要满足了他的需求即可
just as long as it served his needs.

242
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:09,010
他利用了你
He used you.

243
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:13,094
我再问你一次
So let's start over.

244
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:17,054
你知道杰克·鲍尔在哪吗
Do you know where Jack Bauer is?

245
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:22,065
可能在某处吧  手里掌握着你们
Probably somewhere with the evidence you guys

246
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:25,079
想极力掩盖的证据
keep saying doesn't exist.

247
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,072
跟我耍花招没有好下场的
You really don't want to be playing with me.

248
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,026
什么事
What?

249
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,019
好消息  我们可能有鲍尔的线索了
Good news, we may have a line on Bauer.

250
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:36,090
我们窃听到一个电话
We intercepted a call.

251
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,040
最后一次机会
Last chance.

252
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:45,047
如果再执迷不悟  谁也救不了你
You don't take it, there's nothing anyone can do for you.

253
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,065
把他带走收押
Take him to holding.

254
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:00,066
阿洛从国安局梯队情报系统获得了
Arlo got a cell phone intercept report

255
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,002
一份手机监听报告
of NSA's Echelon.

256
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,052
关键词是  哈桑  俄罗斯政府  杰克·鲍尔
Key words are Hassan, Russian government, Jack Bauer.

257
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,056
-阿洛听到对话内容了吗  -暂时还没
- Did Arlo hear any of the conversation? - No, not yet--

258
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,098
目前他只是在处理数据
all he's got so far are the data handles,

259
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:09,048
但他已经在进行声音识别了
but he's processing the voice matrix now.

260
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:10,053
能确定是鲍尔吗
Are we sure it's Bauer?

261
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,083
暂时还不能  但是电话的另外一方
No, not yet, but the other side of the call

262
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,053
登记的是  梅瑞狄斯·里德
was a phone registered to Meredith Reed.

263
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,060
她是反恐组昨晚抓的那名记者
She's the reporter CTU arrested last night

264
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:18,047
是在第一次暗杀哈桑之前抓的
before the first attempt on Hassan's life.

265
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:20,011
有传言说她是哈桑的情妇
Rumor has it she was also his mistress.

266
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:22,021
如果鲍尔要把证据交给其他人的话
If Bauer was going to reach out to someone with the evidence,

267
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:23,071
她肯定是首选
she would be an excellent choice.

268
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:24,074
阿洛  先放下手头的工作
Arlo, stop what you're doing.

269
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:26,017
给监听内容做好警示标记并加密上锁
Tag and lock the intercept download

270
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:27,078
然后直接传到伊登的系统里
and send it directly to Eden's system.

271
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,078
-由她来接手  -没必要  长官
- She'll take it from there. - That's not necessary, sir.

272
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:31,068
我叫你让伊登来处理  谢了  阿洛
I said I want Eden to handle it. Thanks, Arlo.

273
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,025
有一个视频文件
There's a video file that was made

274
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,089
是打入反恐组内部的俄方间谍留下的
by a Russian agent working out of CTU.

275
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,074
她做这文件的初衷是为求自保
She made it for her own protection.

276
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:03,020
视频可以解释过去24小时发生的一切
It explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours.

277
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,025
你和当局取得联系了吗
Have you contacted the authorities about any of this?

278
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,057
我不能去  我被人陷害  就像你昨天一样
I can't. I'm being set up just like you were yesterday.

279
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:09,049
我得把这证据交给你
I need to get this evidence to you.

280
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,038
特纳百货公司3楼  有一间咖啡厅
There's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store.

281
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:13,098
你看20分钟内你能赶到吗
Do you think you can get there in the next 20 minutes?

282
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:15,002
是杰克·鲍尔
Jack Bauer.

283
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,066
我们确定了声纹
We confirmed the voiceprint.

284
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,082
这么说...
So...

285
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,060
他下一步棋就是把证据送媒体曝光
take it to the press-- that's his next move.

286
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,097
看来是的
It appears to be.

287
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:24,034
以里德与哈桑的关系
Reed's connection to Hassan means

288
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,003
她打心眼里愿意帮助杰克
she'd be highly motivated to help him.

289
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:28,070
杰克还没给她看过什么  对吧
And he hasn't shown her anything yet?

290
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,031
-没有  长官  -那就是说
- No, sir. - Which still means that we,

291
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:32,075
我们仍然不知道到底是什么证据
we don't know what the evidence actually is.

292
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:34,080
反正我们很快就会把证据搞到手的
Well, it will be in our hands soon enough.

293
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,085
这是一个扫除一切障碍的大好时机  长官
This is a major opportunity to make everything go away, sir.

294
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,039
鲍尔和证据
Bauer and the evidence.

295
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,065
我已经派遣了俄方行动小组前往那里
I've already dispatched the Russian ops team to the location.

296
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,043
他们会在杰克和里德见面之前就位
They'll be in position well before the meet.

297
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:46,041
你得摆平当地的执法部门
You need to deal with local law enforcement,

298
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,037
确保帕维尔能施展拳脚
make sure Pavel has room to move.

299
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:50,067
我们正把纽约警局的人调离那里
Yes, we're deploying NYPD away from the site,

300
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,084
但我们仍需要你们的人尽可能地速战速决
but we'll still need your guys in and out as quickly as possible.

301
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,096
明白了
Understood.

302
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:57,039
杰森  这是你们取得的重大突破
Jason, this is, this is a major break you've got,

303
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,021
这是决定性的突破
a major break.

304
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,074
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

305
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:02,037
我们会把事办妥的
We'll shut this down.

306
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:05,011
我想亲自监督此事  米哈伊尔
I want to stay on top of this personally, Mikhail.

307
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:08,071
你能把帕维尔的电话号码给我吗
So will you let me have Pavel's number?

308
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,074
能让这房间有点私密空间吗
Can you make this room less public?

309
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,049
你找我有何吩咐吗
You wanted me for something?

310
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,012
对  你拦截到的那个电话
Yeah, the call you intercepted--

311
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,056
就是皮勒强行插手的那个
the one that Pillar hijacked--

312
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,062
你觉得是杰克打来的吗
do you think it was from Jack?

313
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:34,096
无法确定
I can't be sure.

314
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,059
程序筛选出的关键词是  哈桑  核  鲍尔
The program hit on keywords Hassan, nuclear, Bauer,

315
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,073
但这三个词在过去几小时内都在新闻上出现过
but all three have been in the news in the last few hours.

316
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:41,043
可这电话是打给梅瑞狄斯·里德手机的
But the call was to Meredith Reed's cell phone.

317
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,080
她是一名追踪报道哈桑人物传记的记者
She's a journalist with an interest in the Hassan story.

318
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:46,013
所以有很多人会给她打电话
Plenty of people could be calling her.

319
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,057
不一定非得是杰克
Doesn't have to be Jack.

320
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:49,050
好吧  那这个怎么解释
Okay, then explain this.

321
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:51,060
电话截获报告刚发到这里
Cell intercept report comes in here.

322
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,044
而两分钟之后
Two minutes later

323
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,031
皮勒就把整个对话录音下载到一个独立服务器
Pillar downloads the entire conversation into a segregated server

324
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:56,094
并且安装有我从未见过的防火墙
surrounded by firewalls like I've never seen.

325
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,000
知道他后来又做了什么吗
Then what does he do?

326
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,078
拨出了  一个  两个  三个电话
Call one, call two, call three.

327
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,097
机主: 皮勒  保密线路
Pillar Restricted

328
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,008
他会打给谁
Who'd he call?

329
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:04,055
我不知道
I don't know.

330
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,082
均超出了反恐组的监控范围  且全部加密
They're outside of CTU and they're all completely masked.

331
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,016
所以现在问题是  如果这电话无关紧要
So the question is this: if the call was nothing,

332
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:10,059
那他们为什么还要掩饰
then why are they still hiding it?

333
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,086
若这电话是杰克打来的  
If the call was Jack,

334
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:14,026
那他们为何还不派出反恐组特警队
then why haven't they dispatched CTU SWAT team?

335
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:17,013
又为何不向纽约警局发警报
Why haven't they alerted NYPD?

336
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,014
阿洛  他们也参与了企图掩盖真相的阴谋
Arlo, they're in on the cover-up.

337
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,040
看看他们
Look at them.

338
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
更糟的是  他们正打算干掉杰克
What's worse is, they're planning on taking Jack out.

339
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:29,025
为什么  为什么他们要那么做
Why? Why would they want to do that?

340
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,068
因为他知道的太多了
Because he knows too much.

341
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:32,015
他已拿到了丹娜的证据
He's gotten a hold of Dana's evidence,

342
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:34,068
从而证明俄当局介入了暗杀哈桑的行动
which proves the Russian involvement in Hassan's assassination.

343
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,055
他们不能让他把真相公之于众
They can't let him go public with that.

344
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,020
因此我要找到他  而我需要你的帮助
That's why I have to find him, and I need your help.

345
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:48,040
好吧
Okay.

346
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,027
你想怎么干
How do you want to do it?

347
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,054
我要去跟科尔谈谈
I'm gonna talk to Cole.

348
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,030
在过去两小时里  他一直跟杰克和丹娜在一起
He just spent the past two hours with Jack and Dana.

349
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:56,074
他一定知道杰克想干什么
He must have some idea of what Jack's up to.

350
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,041
皮勒在时刻监视科尔
Pillar's got Cole continuously monitored.

351
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:00,004
你不可能偷着溜进去的
You can't get in there without being seen.

352
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,078
我们来剪辑一段循环视频
We'll create a loop

353
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,061
插入到监控录像的信号中
and graft it into the security feed.

354
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,098
我们就会碰到另一个问题
That's the other problem:

355
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:07,023
他们在我们系统上增加了一层额外的监控
they added an extra layer of oversight to our system.

356
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:09,045
我试图进行超越我安全许可的操作时
Second I try to move beyond my security clearance,

357
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:11,022
我屏幕上就会出现警告
I get an on-screen warning.

358
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,089
他们在监视着我们的一举一动
They're watching everything we're doing.

359
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:15,096
那好吧
Okay, fine.

360
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:25,060
我们这么办  创建一个无线信号发射点
We'll use this, create a mobile hot spot.

361
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:30,051
那样我们就可以用独立网络而不用受皮勒监视 
That way we can work off our own net without Pillar breathing down our necks.

362
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,064
明白
Got it.

363
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,049
正在配置备用网络
Setting up alternate network now.

364
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,079
接入网络了
We're up.

365
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:49,076
好了  我正在限制对你我的访问
Okay, I'm restricting access to you and me.

366
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,086
循环录像的时长是多长
How long will it take you to make the loop?

367
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:54,013
只能给你90秒的时间
I can only give you 90 seconds.

368
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,050
一超时  就会有人发现
Anything more than that, somebody will notice.

369
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,093
好吧  你设置好了给我发信息
Okay, text me when you're set up.

370
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,025
画面起始及循环点已记录 
Start Loop Point Logged

371
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,090
录制中  最大时长  90秒
Recording: 90 Seconds Maximum Time Allowed

372
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:32,004
弗雷德里克斯  麦克德蒙特被电磁脉冲弹炸伤了
Fredericks, McDermott was injured in the E.M.P. Blast,

373
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,017
我需要你把夜班卡给我收好
so I need you to collect the night shift time cards

374
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,041
送到我办公室来
and take them to my office.

375
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,011
好的
Okay.

376
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,058
可否现在就去
Like now?

377
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,048
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,009
你有90秒的行动时间  -阿洛
You're clear for 90 seconds. -Arlo

379
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,000
我们给监控信号插入了循环录像
We put a loop in the security feed.

380
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,013
我只有90秒时间
I've only got 90 seconds,

381
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,077
所以我得直扑主题
so I'm gonna get straight to the point.

382
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,023
我要找到杰克
I need to find Jack

383
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,010
-不然他们会杀了他  -谁要杀他
- or else they're gonna kill him.  - Who's gonna kill him?

384
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:07,029
皮勒和他的部下
Pillar and whoever is working with him.

385
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:08,050
你得告诉我他在哪
You need to tell me where he is.

386
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,032
我不知道
I got no idea.

387
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,024
你和他都在银行  
You were at the bank with him;

388
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,041
他一定说过什么
he must have said something.

389
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:14,091
听着  杰克出尔反尔说一套做一套
Hey, what Jack says and what he does are two very different things.

390
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:16,018
他要去揭穿阴谋  披露真相
He's trying to expose the cover-up.

391
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,058
他才不管什么企图掩盖真相的阴谋呢
He doesn't give a damn about any cover-up.

392
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:22,012
他要把所有与蕾妮的死有关的人统统杀光
He's taking out anyone who was anywhere near Renee's death,

393
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,095
首先拿丹娜开刀
starting with Dana.

394
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,031
她已经给了他证据  可他还是杀了她
She gave him the evidence and he killed her anyway.

395
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,096
她拿了保险箱里的枪
She took the gun out of the safety deposit box.

396
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,080
他朝她近距离平射
He shot her point-blank.

397
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,062
杰克处决了她  正如她所预料的
He executed her, just like she said he would.

398
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,094
整件事里根本就没有好人
There are no good guys here.

399
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,070
杰克  皮勒  让他们互相残杀
Jack, Pillar... they end up killing each other,

400
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,094
也许才是最好的结局
maybe it's the best thing.

401
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,084
不行  杰克是我的朋友
No, Jack's my friend.

402
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,031
如果我能找到他  我就能说服他
If I can find him, I can talk him down.

403
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:50,048
而这些人只会去要他的命
These people are just going to kill him.

404
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,012
我需要你站在我一边
I need you to be on my side.

405
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,098
所有人都想要拉拢我
Everybody wants me on their side.

406
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:57,069
我却又为谁而战呢
Who am I fighting for?

407
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,086
如果我们能找到他  
If we can get to him,

408
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:02,039
我们就能揭穿这个掩盖真相的阴谋
we can expose the cover-up.

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,060
你就待在这里继续自我忏悔吧
You just stay here and feel sorry for yourself.

410
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,040
我自己去找他
I'm gonna go find him.

411
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,043
等等
Wait.

412
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:17,004
听着  我知道的不多  杰克可能有个帮手
Look, it's not much, but Jack's got to be working with someone.

413
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,017
谁
Who?

414
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,034
我不知道  我没见过他
I don't know; I never saw him,

415
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,070
但从杰克配备有最尖端的武器和通讯系统判断
but Jack showed up with state-of-the-art weapons and comms,

416
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,078
他一定在城里有联络人
so he's got to have a contact in the city.

417
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:24,088
你要想找到杰克
You want to find Jack,

418
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:26,065
得先找到这个帮手
you find his supplier.

419
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:27,072
谢谢
Thanks.

420
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:34,076
阿洛
Arlo.

421
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,056
出来得很及时  你没事吧
You got out in time. You okay?

422
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:37,045
是的  我没事  
Yeah, I'm okay.

423
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:38,063
听着  我知道杰克的动向了
Listen, I know what Jack's doing.

424
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,053
调出他的档案  把他在三州交界的联系人
Pull up his files, get me the list of his known associates in the tri-state area,

425
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,077
还有他以前的同事的名单给我
anyone he's worked with in the past.

426
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,077
好的
Okay.

427
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,080
在接下来的半小时里
In the next half hour,

428
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:47,084
被广泛认为是和平协议的
the man who has widely been acknowledged

429
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:50,057
"关键的第三方"人物
as the vital "Third partner" in the peace process--

430
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:52,078
俄国总统尤里·萨瓦洛夫
Russian President Yuri Suvarov--

431
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,061
将飞抵肯尼迪国际机场
will touch down at JFK.

432
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:56,065
他将转乘直升机前往曼哈顿
He'll be ferried into Manhattan by helicopter

433
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,072
之后会前往联合国大厦
and then to the U.N.

434
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:15,097
喂
Yes.

435
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,010
帕维尔  请报告最新情况
Pavel, update, please.

436
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:20,027
我的小队已就位
My team is in position.

437
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,098
发现鲍尔了吗
Any sign of Bauer?

438
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,065
还没有
Not yet.

439
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,098
我需要知道
I need to know.

440
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:30,008
怎么处理那女人
What about the woman?

441
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:31,028
那女人
The woman?

442
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:35,049
就是那个记者  怎么处置她
The journalist, her disposition.

443
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:38,005
里德女士一直协助和煽动恐怖活动
Ms. Reed is aiding and abetting a terrorist.

444
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:40,076
她对我们两国都是个严重的威胁
She's a serious threat to both our countries.

445
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:42,066
你看着办
Do what you have to.

446
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:19,040
我从伊桑的笔记上看到我们仍未彻底解决
I see from Ethan's notes that we still have not completely resolved

447
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,022
检查团通行许可的问题
the issue of site access for the inspection teams.

448
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:24,005
我认为这问题已经解决了
I believe it was resolved.

449
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,026
哈桑总统同意了
President Hassan agreed

450
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:28,062
观察员将获得在全国的通行许可
the inspectors would have right of passage over our entire country.

451
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,047
但是他将学校列在范围之外
But he exempted schools.

452
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:31,088
只有小学
Only primary schools.

453
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:33,031
奥马可不认为
Omar didn't think

454
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,048
10岁小孩会去造核弹
ten-year-old children would be building nuclear missiles.

455
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,092
当然不会
Of course.

456
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,022
我想起来了
I remember now.

457
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,055
我深表歉意
I-I do apologize.

458
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:48,038
您没事吧  总统阁下
Are you all right, Madam President?

459
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:51,069
今天太漫长了
It's been a long day.

460
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,022
我很好  谢谢
I'm fine. Thank you.

461
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:55,094
总统阁下
Madam President.

462
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:02,047
请恕我失陪几分钟
If you'll excuse me for a few minutes,

463
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,058
我有人要接见
there's someone I need to see.

464
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:04,058
当然可以
Of course.

465
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,030
他在哪
Where is he?

466
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,087
他在会议室  总统阁下
He's in the conference room, ma'am.

467
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,095
感谢您能和我见面  总统阁下
Thank you for seeing me, Madam President.

468
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:21,002
我有好消息
I have good news.

469
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,025
我们掌握了鲍尔的方位
We've located Bauer.

470
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,021
我手里有证据  但...
He-He has the evidence, but...

471
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:25,035
查尔斯  你向我保证过
Charles, you assured me

472
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,052
事情不会走到这一步
that that wouldn't happen.

473
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,072
请让我说完
Please, let me finish.

474
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,048
我们知道鲍尔将会现身的确切位置
We know exactly where Bauer will be

475
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,026
和确切时间  而且此时此刻
and when, and-and we have an operation underway

476
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,071
我们已经展开了对他的抓捕行动了
to reacquire him even as we speak.

477
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:37,079
相信我  这是个好消息
Believe me, this is good news.

478
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:43,037
事情一完就立刻通知我
Let me know as soon as it's resolved.

479
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:45,081
我要回去谈判了
I need to get back to the negotiations.

480
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:48,038
还有件事  总统阁下
Just... There's just one thing, Madam President.

481
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:53,034
还有三个小时就要签署条约
Uh, we are three hours away from the signing of the treaty.

482
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:58,009
我在这次和平进程中扮演的角色
Isn't it time for my role in the process

483
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,092
是否该获得官方承认了
to be officially recognized?

484
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,076
我在想的是类似于...
I was thinking some kind of, uh,

485
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,051
向媒体发布一份声明
announcement to the media,

486
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:08,026
或许由您的新闻秘书发布
perhaps by your press secretary,

487
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:10,070
甚至由您亲自宣布也可以  总统阁下
or maybe even by you yourself, Madam President.

488
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,084
您该记得我们协商好
It was, you'll recall, our agreement

489
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,084
我会以官方身份出现在这历史性的一天
that I would have a public face on this historic day.

490
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,081
我相信这是我应得的
I believe I've earned it.

491
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:32,015
我会告诉我的新闻秘书
I will talk to my press secretary.

492
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:36,062
她会在一点的新闻上及时发表这份声明
She will make the announcement in time for the 1:00 o'clock news.

493
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:38,073
非常感谢  总统阁下

已接触目标

495
00:24:57,018 --> 00:24:59,005
目标直奔三楼的电梯处去了

509
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,089
我们没有看见鲍尔

510
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:01,028
杰森  你去哪

发现他了  他正要去...
There he is. He's heading up towards...

513
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:10,003
没发现
I do not have him.

514
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,025
什么  他就在那里  我们看见他了  
What? He's there. We see him.

515
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,069
把眼睛睁大点  该死
Get your eyes open, damn it!

516
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:14,069
我还是没看见他
I have not seen him.

517
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:15,060
发现他了
Got him.

518
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,071
鲍尔从西南角处  快接近目标了

519
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:20,013
身穿棕色皮夹克和牛仔裤
He's got a brown leather jacket and jeans.

520
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,060

帕维尔  他已在视线范围内

他快要到咖啡厅了
He's closing in on the cafe.

523
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:30,059
你应该已对他有清晰的瞄准视野了
You should have a clean line on him.

524
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:39,058
帕维尔  有机会就开枪
Pavel, if you have a shot, take it.

525
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,015
我看见他了
I've got him.

526
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:45,095
把枪放下
Put it down.

527
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:52,025
上面都处理好了  杰克
Everything's all clear up at the top, Jack.

00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:40,096
他知道这是个陷阱
He knew it was a trap.

537
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:44,004
别让他们脱离视线
Don't let them out of your sight.

538

539
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:46,019
继续找
Just keep looking!

540
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:50,055
你开枪杀的是些什么人
Those people you shot-- who were they?

541
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:53,002
-俄国间谍  你有问题吗  -没有
- Russian operatives. You have any problems? - No.

542
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:57,065
我们走
Let's move.

543
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:23,030
杰森  说吧
Jason. Tell me.

544
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,093
恐怕我得告诉您一个坏消息  长官
I'm afraid I have bad news, sir.

545
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,034
帕维尔的小队全军覆没
All of Pavel's team is dead,

546
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:30,047
帕维尔也被鲍尔抓走了
and Bauer has Pavel.

547
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:32,047
他从一开始就比我们捷足先登  长官
He was ahead of us from the get-go, sir.

548
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:34,021
他肯定早料到我们会使用梯形情报系统
He must have anticipated that we'd use Echelon,

549
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:36,011
然后他设计了一系列关键词
and he put out a series of keywords,

550
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,068
并料到监听站会截获这些关键词
knowing the listening stations would pick them up.

551
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:39,085
他耍了我们  长官
He played us, sir.

552
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:42,055
他知道我们会动用非常规人员来对付他
He knew we'd use off-book resources to deal with him.

553
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:44,059
他利用那个记者引蛇出洞
He used that journalist to draw them out.

554
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:48,034
长官  现在情况的严重性已不言而喻
Now, sir, I hardly need to tell you that the situation is grave.

555
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:50,078
帕维尔知道一切
Pavel knows everything.

556
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:53,050
他安插了沃什  他主导了俄方的一系列行动
He ran Walsh, he set up the Russian ops.

557
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:56,016
要是鲍尔撬开了帕维尔的嘴...
If Bauer gets Pavel to talk...

558
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:59,064
但目前来说  长官
But at the moment, sir,

559
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,044
您仍然可以否认一切
you still have complete deniability.

560
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:04,054
所有的决定都是泰勒总统作出的
President Taylor made all the decisions.

561
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:07,038
我觉得现在是时候
I think the time has come

562
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:10,038
让您远离是非了
for you to distance yourself from this mess.

563
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:12,038
虽然非常的遗憾  长官
It's regrettable, sir, deeply so,

564
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:14,014
但我觉得这是目前对您最好的选择
but I believe it's what's best for you.

565
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:15,050
你...  
You...

566
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:19,079
二十分钟后
20 minutes from now,

567
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:21,079
总统的新闻秘书
the president's press secretary

568
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:23,001
就要发表一份声明
is going to make an announcement.

569
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:24,029
她会宣布...
She will say...

570
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:27,040
我已成为总统政府的一员
I have become part of the president's team,

571
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:30,080
在让和平进程功德圆满的过程中
and-and I have been indispensable in bringing this peace process

572
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:32,047
我发挥了无可取代的作用
to a successful close.

573
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,047
长官  请原谅我告诉您这是个坏主意
Sir, may I say that that is a bad idea?

574
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:35,094
您现在得远离是非
You need to distance yourself.

575
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,084
什么  你一直在用那个词
What? You keep using that phrase.

576
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:39,051
什么叫远离是非
What-What does distance myself mean?

577
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:41,004
是要我偷偷溜走吗
Do I just slink away?

578
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:43,077
有些情况是我们始料未及的
There were circumstances we couldn't have anticipated.

579
00:29:43,077 --> 00:29:44,067
也就是鲍尔
Namely Bauer.

580
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,085
那就找到他  干掉他
Well, then, we find Bauer, and we neutralize him.

581
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:51,039
我们从幕后走向了台前  杰森
We're public now, Jason.

582
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:53,026
我们致力于此
We're committed.

583
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:56,083
而且我已经...  是我们
And I have worked... We...

584
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:59,016
我们已经付诸了太多心血
We have worked too hard

585
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:01,000
不能让其付之东流
just to throw this all away.

586
00:30:01,006 --> 00:30:02,016
你明白了吗
Do you understand?

587
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:04,060
-当然  长官  但是帕维尔...  -不
- Yes, of course, sir, but Pavel... - No.

588
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,044
帕维尔是出色的战士
Pavel is a good soldier.

589
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:10,074
无论鲍尔怎么拷问  他都不会招供的
He won't talk, whatever Bauer does to him.

590
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:15,092
我让你进反恐小组  是有原因的  杰森
I, uh... I put you at CTU, Jason, for a reason.

591
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:18,045
他们拥有丰富的资源
They have huge resources.

592
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:20,028
而你有勇有谋
You have intelligence and tenacity.

593
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:25,035
利用好这一切  找到鲍尔
You use those capabilities. Find Bauer.

594
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:27,012
是  长官
Yes, sir.

595
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,006
-我会亲自前往现场  -很好
- I'll head down to the scene myself. - Good.

596
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:33,050
随时向我报告
Keep me posted.

597
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,067
他想继续下去
He wants to move forward.

598
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,097
他真的明白现在的状况吗
Does he understand what actually happened?

599
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:44,021
是的  但他说我们仍有选择的余地
Yes, but he says we still have options.

600
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:50,021
告诉我  你会跟我同舟共济
I need to know you're with me on this.

601
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:53,095
是的  同舟共济
Yes. Yes, I'm with you.

602
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:56,009
好  我要出去了
Good. I'm heading out.

603
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:58,015
我会清理现场留下的一切俄罗斯人的证据
I'll clean up the scene, remove all trace of the Russians,

604
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,045
然后设法找到鲍尔的下落
and get on Bauer's trail.

605
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:01,002
我会带上反恐小组的特警队
I'll take CTU SWAT with me.

606
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:03,047
命令纽约警局以商店为圆心警戒周围两个街区
Tell NYPD to put a two-block perimeter around the store.

607
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:05,001
没有我的命令不得让任何人出入
No one goes in or out without my say-so.

608
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:06,017
我该以什么理由命令他们
What reason do I give them?

609
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:09,074
如有任何人阻挠  就以白宫的名义行使权力
Anyone gives you a hard time, invoke the White House.

610
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,058
有杰克帮手的线索了吗
Any luck with Jack's associates?

611
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:20,098
没有  即使排除死去的人
No. Even discounting dead people,

612
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:22,017
以及外国人
and people from foreign countries,

613
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,040
还是得花上几个小时
it's still going to take hours.

614
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,041
我可以缩小范围
I think I can narrow it down.

615
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,096
我刚监听到市中心特纳百货公司
I just picked up a 911 call

616
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:27,029
打来的一个报警电话
from Turner's in Midtown.

617
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:29,083
那里发生了枪击事件  造成了人员伤亡
There was a shoot-out, people killed.

618
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,027
我成功进入了那家商店的监控系统
I managed to get into the store's security system.

619
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,019
天哪  
Oh, my God.

620
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:39,021
是杰克
That's Jack.

621
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,058
他们想杀他
They're trying to kill him.

622
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:44,011
是的  不过计划没有成功
Yeah, that part of the plan didn't go so well.

623
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:46,001
我对监控录像从枪战开始前五分钟
I tagged the footage 5 minutes before

624
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:47,058
到结束后五分钟做了标记
to 5 minutes after the shooting.

625
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,062
如果我们对录像中的人进行面部识别
If we run facial recognition on the camera feeds...

626
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,022
就能与杰克帮手们的数据库进行比对
We can match it to the database of Jack's associates,

627
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:54,052
也许就能找出杰克是和谁联手了
maybe find out who he's working with.

628
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,099
多谢  阿洛
Thanks, Arlo.

629
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:58,016
不客气
No problem.

630
00:31:58,023 --> 00:31:59,057
把那些录像画面复制到我屏幕上
Copy the camera footage to my screen.

631
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:01,037
我会把一半的人员档案发给你
I'll send you half the personnel files.

632
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,045
安全  我们走
We're clear. Let's go.

633
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,040
快走
Let's go.

634
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,029
快掏空你口袋里的东西
Empty your pockets right now here.

635
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,028
坐下
Take a seat.

636
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:40,086
在这我们暂时是安全的
We'll be safe here for a while.

637
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:53,018
杰克  我们时间不多
Jack? We don't have much time.

638
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,068
脱下你的外套
Take off your coat.

639
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,021
快
Now!

640
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:06,025
你刚杀的那些人...
Those people you killed...

641
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:09,001
你准备好要杀他们  是吗
you were ready for them, weren't you?

642
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:10,035
你早知道他们会来的
You knew they were coming.

643
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,038
是的
Yeah.

644
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:15,052
那你  你早知道他们会窃听我们的电话
So you... you knew they'd be listening to our phone call.

645
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,082
是这样吗
Isn't that right?

646
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:22,069
你利用我引他们出来  对吗
You used me to draw them out, right?

647
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:24,003
是的
That's right.

648
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,017
我可能会死在那里
I could have been killed back there!

649
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:27,013
你没死
You weren't.

650
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:31,060
快捡起来
Now, pick it up.

651
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:33,086
我叫你把它捡起来
I said pick it up!

652
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:36,003
你说过要给我证据
What about the evidence you said you'd tell me?

653
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,017
那也是谎言  是不是
Was that a lie, too?

654
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,054
不是
No.

655
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:44,088
证据在这张记忆卡里
The evidence is on this memory card.

656
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,058
你看到视频  就会知道一切是真的
When you see it, you'll know it's real.

657
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,018
拿着
Take it.

658
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:56,005
我搭档会带你去个地方  给你看
My partner's gonna take you somewhere to show it to you.

659
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:59,086
我很抱歉  是我不得已而为之
I'm sorry things had to play out like this.

660
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:02,006
我别无选择
I didn't see another choice.

661
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,083
那你接着要干什么
What are you gonna do?

662
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,040
把双手放到背后  快
Put your hands behind your back. Now!

663
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,072
不要这么做  求你  你不想这么做的
Don't do this, please. You don't want to do this.

664
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:12,050
把她带到储藏室
Take her to the storeroom.

665
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:13,094
不  我哪也不去
No, I'm not going anywhere.

666
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:15,087
求你了  你不能这样做
Please, you cannot do this.

667
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,037
我给你的证据
The evidence I gave you

668
00:34:17,044 --> 00:34:19,062
没能告诉我沃什是怎么卷入这勾当的
doesn't tell me how Walsh was involved.

669
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:20,056
他能告诉我
He will.

670
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,004
-走吧  -不
- Come on. - No.

671
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:24,026
你不能这样做
You cannot do this this way!

672
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:29,081
坐在那
Sit over there.

673
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:41,043
春田造M1A式步枪
Springfield, M1A rifle.

674
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:46,014
点308口径弹药
.308 round.

675
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:52,008
约四小时之前
You know, about four hours ago,

676
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:57,012
我的一个朋友  一个非常要好的朋友
I had a friend of mine-- very good friend--

677
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:00,089
名叫蕾妮·沃克  就死在这型号的枪下
named Renee Walker was killed by a rifle just like that.

678
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:02,073
去死吧
Go to hell.

679
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:12,034
我先送你一程
You first.

680
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:26,051
刺杀哈桑的行动已万事俱备
The hit on Hassan is all arranged.

681
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:28,071
巴扎耶夫及其手下正在处理一切
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.

682
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:31,050
你只能和我单线联系
You talk to no one but me.

683
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,062
就此打住
We're done here.

684
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:38,002
哈桑死之前不许再联系我
Don't contact me again until Hassan is dead.

685
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:48,085
老实和你说
To be honest with you,

686
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:52,026
蕾妮·沃克不只是我的普通朋友
Renee Walker was more than just my friend.

687
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,016
你应该已经知道了  不是吗
But you already know that, don't you?

688
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,086
你看到我们在我公寓的卧室里
Because you saw us in the bedroom of my apartment.

689
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:03,003
这么说  要么是你狙击手的枪法太烂
Now, you're either not very good at what you do...

690
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:07,013
要么就是你想让她生不如死
or you wanted her to suffer.

691
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,091
因为以这把枪的射程
Because with that rifle from that range,

692
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:11,054
轻而易举就能一枪毙命
it was an easy kill shot.

693
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,094
但你却
But instead,

694
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:14,071
把枪眼对准她...
you shot her...

695
00:36:14,077 --> 00:36:16,021
就是这里
right there...

696
00:36:16,028 --> 00:36:18,044
心脏以下两英寸
two inches below her heart,

697
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,058
让她慢慢放血
so she would bleed out slowly.

698
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:22,001
我看着她
I watched her

699
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:24,012
因为血液慢慢填满肺部
gasping for air...

700
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:26,092
而艰难呼吸
as the blood slowly filled her lungs.

701
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,027
在痛苦中死去
She died in agony,

702
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:31,002
除非你告诉我  我想知道的
which is exactly what I'm gonna make you do

703
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:33,093
否则我也让你尝尝这滋味
unless you tell me what I want to know.

704
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:48,041
快说
Start talking to me!

705
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:53,014
你想知道  是不是我杀了你女朋友
You want to know I killed your girlfriend?

706
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:57,032
是我杀的她
I killed her.

707
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:58,098
是我杀了你那婊子
I kill your bitch!

708
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:08,040
求你  求你  你得让他住手  求你
Please... please, you've got to stop him. Please.

709
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,070
你要得到答案  他会给他的
He needs answers, and he's gonna get 'em.

710
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,030
我能用这向大众证明  这足够了
I can use this. There's enough here.

711
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:13,015
我不需要更多了
I don't need any more.

712
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:15,015
告诉他  我不需要更多了  求你了
Tell him I don't need any more. Please.

713
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,088
你哪儿也不能去
You're not going anywhere.

714
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,060
请让开  让开  让开
Move aside. Move. Move.

715
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:47,097
请离开尸体
Please step back from the bodies.

716
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:50,044
我宣布这里是反恐小组罪案现场
This is now a CTU crime scene.

717
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:53,048
我要所有从这些人身上搜到的武器和文件
I need all weapons and documents you found on these people.

718
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:54,060
长官  这是所有我们找到的
This is all we got, sir.

719
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,051
但所有人身上都没有身份证明
None of them had I.D.s on them.

720
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:05,042
这就是我们在找的人
This is the man we're looking for.

721
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,018
他名叫杰克·鲍尔
His name is Jack Bauer.

722
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,051
现在  你们分头去找他
Now, you need to spread out

723
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:10,047
检查每层楼面和每个出口
and check every floor and every exit.

724
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:13,097
他手上有人质  所以不会走远
He has a hostage with him, so he won't have gotten far.

725
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,010
鲍尔携带武器  是个非常危险的人物
Bauer's armed and extremely dangerous,

726
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:17,097
如果你们不想下场和这些人一样
so if you don't want to end up like these people,

727
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,080
见到他格杀勿论
shoot on sight.

728
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:20,086
我们走
Let's go.

729
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,082
听好了
Hey.

730
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:39,025
你醒了  我们接着玩如何
So, why don't we start this again.

731
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:43,035
我已知道是你杀了蕾妮·沃克
I already know that you killed Renee Walker.

732
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:44,056
我现在要知道的是...
What I want to know...

733
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:47,089
俄罗斯政府里面
is the name...

734
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:49,053
那头下命令的
of the Russian pig

735
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:52,012
俄国猪的
inside your government

736
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,098
名字
...that gave the order.

737
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:59,027
告诉我名字  我会给你个痛快
Give me a name, and I'll end this quickly.

738
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:00,040
我说话算话
I give you my word.

739
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:20,012
你觉得你了解痛苦是吗
You think you know about pain?

740
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:22,067
现在才刚开始
You don't know anything yet.

741
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,052
告诉我你们政府里
Give me the name of the person

742
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:29,072
想要蕾妮·沃克死的
inside your government

743
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:31,030
那个人的名字
who wanted Renee Walker dead!

744
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,065
告诉我名字
Give me the name!

745
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:37,021
是谁下的命令
Who gave the order?!

746
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,008
你们政府里的谁
Who inside your government

747
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,069
想要置蕾妮·沃克于死地
wanted Renee Walker dead?

748
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,078
你只要把名字告诉我
All you got to do is give me the name!

749
00:39:57,093 --> 00:40:00,049
你们这些人蠢到家了
You people are so stupid.

750
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:03,043
蕾妮·沃克对你们不是什么威胁
Renee Walker wasn't a threat to you.

751
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,083
她任务完成了  完成了  我们退出行动了
Her work was finished. She was done. We were out.

752
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:09,087
你们要做的  就是别再来找我们麻烦
All you had to do is leave us alone.

753
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:15,010
你们为什么就不能放过我们呢
Now, why couldn't you just leave us alone?

754
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,083
我要那个给你命令
I want the name of the person

755
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,028
让你开枪的人的名字
who gave the order to pull the trigger!

756
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,064
是谁下的命令
Who gave the order?!

757
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,042
快说
Now!

758
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:30,041
是我一个人干的
Did it on my own!

759
00:40:30,048 --> 00:40:32,031
你在说谎  你只是个无名小卒
You're lying. You're nothing.

760
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:34,034
你没有权力
You didn't have the authority.

761
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,047
我要那人的名字
I want the name!

762
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:36,082
告诉我那人的名字
Give me the name!

763
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:38,076
我的名字叫帕维尔·托卡列夫
My name is Pavel Tokarev.

764
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:57,084
这个也没用
This isn't working.

765
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:13,085
你的手机SIM卡在哪里
Where's the SIM card for your phone?

766
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:17,058
手机卡在哪里
Where's the SIM card?!

767
00:41:21,036 --> 00:41:22,058
你会扔在哪里
Where'd you drop it?

768
00:41:36,024 --> 00:41:37,079
你这蠢货  你吞了下去
You dumb bastard, you swallowed it.

769
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:40,047
你刚吞了下去
You swallowed it.

770
00:41:42,062 --> 00:41:44,081
这一下是为了我的朋友
This is for my friend.

771
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:02,009
-你们找到什么了  -这边没人  长官
- What do you got? - This side's clear, sir.

772
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:03,073
好  那还有一个员工通道
Fine. There's another service hallway.

773
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:05,013
检查那边所有的员工通道
Check all the service hallways over there.

774
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,010
确保都是锁着的
Make sure they're locked down.

775
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,071
你们  我要你们上去  到三楼
You guys, I want you to go up there, stay on the third floor.

776
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:09,086
马上去
Do it now.

777
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:57,050
您所拨打的是查尔斯·罗根总统的移动电话
You've reached the mobile number of President Charles Logan.

778
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,078
我们不能马上为您接通
We can't take your call right now,

779
00:42:58,078 --> 00:42:59,096
但如果您留下姓名和电话号码
but if you leave your name and number,

780
00:42:59,096 --> 00:43:02,070
我们将尽快给您回电
we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
