00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,020
《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:21,056
司法部正在调查乔纳斯·霍格斯
The justice department is investigating

3
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:24,090
的汽车炸弹的事
The Jonas Hodges car bombing.

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,006
我告诉过你我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

5
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,010
我没有转账
I didn't transfer the funds.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,086
没给他酬劳  他为什么还对霍奇斯下手呢
Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid?!

7
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:33,033
这正合你意啊  对吧
Because it's what you wanted, am I right?

8
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:36,036
杰克  我破解了托尼的定位数据
Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data.

9
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:40,070
好  我们看到他了
Okay, we've got him.

10
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:46,036
毒气罐在哪里
Where's the canister?!

11
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:50,093
你不告诉我  我不会停手
I am not going to stop until you tell me where it is.

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,016
-杰克  -没事没事
- Jack. - It's all right, it's all right.

13
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,030
你该打一针了
You need to give yourself a shot.

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,046
20分钟前打过了
I already did 20 minutes ago.

15
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,060
没用
It's not working.

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,076
你是回家吗
You heading home?

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,056
我们也是
Us, too.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,006
我是鲍尔
This is Bauer.

19
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,083
我正把链接发到你手机上
I'm sending a link to your phone.

20
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,060
有样东西你需要看一看
It's something I think you should see.

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,046
你女儿正在我们的控制之中
Your daughter's in the company of our operatives.

22
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,093
把这条线连到你耳机上  让它一直开着
Put this call on your earpiece and keep the line open.

23
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:24,020
我要监听你说的每句话
I'm gonna be listening to everything you say.

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,083
你得帮助托尼·阿尔梅达脱身
You will help Tony Almeida escape

25
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,060
不然我的人会杀了你女儿
Or my people will murder your daughter.

26
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,003
以下情节发生在凌晨6点至7点间
The following takes place between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,083
好的
Okay.

28
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,020
谢谢
Thank you.

29
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,003
司法部副部长在等你  女士
The deputy attorney general is ready for you, ma'am.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,020
已启动网真电话会议
Telepresence call is initiated.

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,013
网络安全  请讲吧
Network is secure. Go ahead.

32
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:50,040
早上好  泰勒女士
Good morning, Ms. Taylor.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,030
谢谢你抽空来接受这次调查
Thank you for giving up your time for this investigation.

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,060
我应该做的
Of course.

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,010
这是司法部的罗林斯夫人和霍克先生
Mrs. Rollins and Mr. Hock are from the justice department.

36
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,063
他们会对你进行提问
They'll be conducting your interview.

37
00:01:58,063 --> 00:02:02,016
接下来是
Let the record show that this is to be the testimony

38
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:05,036
白宫首席顾问奥利维亚·泰勒关于
Of Olivia Taylor, acting white house chief of staff

39
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:08,070
联邦证人乔纳斯·霍奇斯谋杀一案的证词
Regarding the homicide of federal witness Jonas Hodges.

40
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,013
我出席是为了确保调查的严谨
Let it also show that I'm present to ensure that

41
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:13,090
保护泰勒女士
Strict protocols be followed for Ms. Taylor's protection.

42
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,050
我为什么需要保护
Why would I need protecting?

43
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,060
用词不准确
A poor choice of words.

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,043
只是这样  对你的询问仅是例行公事
I merely meant that, uh, your questioning is just a formality.

45
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:23,053
我们得对所有知道霍奇斯出事前行踪的人
We have to go through everyone who had knowledge of

46
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,096
进行调查
Hodges' whereabouts up until the time of the car bombing.

47
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:27,000
明白了
I see.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
罗林斯夫人  到你了
Mrs. rollins, you have the floor.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,030
开始吧
Let's begin.

50
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:39,000
我让奥利维亚来参加这次通报会
I wanted olivia in this briefing.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,076
-她在哪里  -抱歉  女士
- Where is she? - I'm sorry, ma'am,

52
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,043
她正跟司法部副部长在一起
But she's tied up with the deputy a.g.

53
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,033
接受霍奇斯谋杀一案的调查
And investigators looking into the Hodges murder.

54
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,016
他们查到谁泄露了霍奇斯所在地点了吗
Have they made any progress on who leaked Hodges' location?

55
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,033
还没有
Not yet.

56
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,000
但他们认为知道霍奇斯还活着
But they agree that the list of people

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,056
待在调查局的人很少
Who knew Hodges was alive and at FBI is short.

58
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,016
泄密人应该是内部人员
The leak had to come from inside.

59
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,053
早上好  各位
Good morning, everyone.

60
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,053
早上好  总统阁下
Morning, madam president.

61
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:02,020
总统阁下
Madam president.

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,066
请坐
Please take your seats.

63
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:08,086
我知道大家都很困顿
I realize that we are all in dire need of sleep.

64
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:12,050
但让各位及时了解
But I felt that it was vital to bring you all up to speed

65
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,056
过去几小时发生的事情
On the events of the past few hours

66
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:18,010
以及即将发生更大的危机  刻不容缓
And a greater crisis we face on the horizon.

67
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,063
不到30分钟前  调查局成功找到
Less than 30 minutes ago, the FBI managed to recover

68
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:24,060
最后一罐生化武器
The last canister of the bioweapon.

69
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,090
但恐怕危险还未解除
But I'm afraid that the danger is far from over.

70
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,013
在乔纳斯·霍奇斯被杀前  他说
Before his death, Jonas Hodges told us

71
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:34,056
还有其他势力也参与了
That there were other parties involved with him

72
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:36,023
生化武器的研制
In the creation of this bioweapon--

73
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:39,006
一些极为隐蔽  既有权势
A highly secret and extremely powerful group

74
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:41,023
的私人军工企业
Of private military firms

75
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:45,020
勾结起来破坏我们国家的政府
Collaborating to undermine the government of this country.

76
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,063
不好意思  总统阁下
Excuse me, madam president.

77
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:48,033
我们说的是哪些军工企业
But which military firms are we talking about?

78
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,000
我们不知道  上将
We don't know, admiral.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,033
霍奇斯没有透露这些公司
Hodges gave us no names or idea

80
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,056
的名字或其他信息
Of which companies are involved.

81
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,080
但不管他们是谁
But whoever they are,

82
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,010
他们都是实实在在的威胁
They represent a very real and ongoing threat.

83
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:06,093
目前我们没有可靠情报
Now, we don't have much actionable intelligence at this point.

84
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:10,060
联邦调查局已经拘押了前反恐组成员
However, the FBI has apprehended former CTU operative

85
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,063
托尼·阿尔梅达
Tony almeida.

86
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:13,080
他是这次阴谋的关键人物
He is a key figure in this plot,

87
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,003
我们希望能通过他
And someone we hope will be able to help us

88
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:18,046
找到这些人
Uncover who these people are.

89
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,043
沃克探员  我是布拉沃三号空援组
Agent Walker, this is air support Bravo Three.

90
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,030
我们已就位  你们的护卫队在视线范围
We're in position. Your convoy is in sight.

91
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,066
收到  布拉沃三号
Roger that, Bravo Three.

92
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,003
警方会调控交通
Metro will be controlling traffic

93
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:30,086
在市区建立安全通道
And setting up a secure corridor through the downtown area.

94
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,020
我们会带托尼·阿尔梅达
We'll be bringing Almeida into headquarters

95
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,026
从西大门进入总部
Through the west entrance.

96
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:37,020
鲍尔先生  是时候了
It's almost time, Mr. Bauer.

97
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,000
跟你一起的护卫队快下I-70洲际公路了
The convoy you're traveling with is about to get off on the I-70.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,030
在进入市区前你必须得行动
You need to break off before you reach the downtown exit

99
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,056
否则就没那么容易帮托尼逃走了
Or you'll lose your chance to facilitate an escape for Tony.

100
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:48,070
为了你女儿好
For your daughter's sake,

101
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,003
你不想这样的
You don't want that to happen.

102
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:53,096
现在好好给我听着
Now listen carefully.

103
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,076
你得控制这辆车
You'll need to commandeer the van

104
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:58,090
开到约四英里外的塔夫特大街路口
And peel onto the taft street exit in about four miles.

105
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,040
到了后我再说怎么做
I'll direct you further once you've managed that.

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,023
记住  我手下的人正看着你女儿
Remember, my operatives are with your daughter.

107
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:07,066
事实上  她的一举一动我都清楚
In fact, I'm looking at her right now.

108
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,046
别想逞英雄
So don't try to be a hero.

109
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,043
怎么了
Something wrong?

110
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,073
感觉飞机要满员了
It's just starting to look like the flight is gonna be full,

111
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:30,083
我只能做下一班
And I'm on standby.

112
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,026
不不  你肯定能登机的
No, no, you're gonna get on.

113
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:34,023
昨天飞机差点相撞的事情
I mean, there have to be some people that are too spooked

114
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,083
肯定有人心有余悸不敢来了
To fly after those planes went down yesterday.

115
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,086
鲍勃
Bob.

116
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,020
提那事干嘛
Did you have to bring that up?

117
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,083
就是说说
I'm just saying.

118
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,010
他们做了预防措施
Look, I think it makes us safer.

119
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,020
会让我们更安心
They're gonna take extra precautions.

120
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
打扰一下
Excuse me.

121
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,086
这些是你的行李吗
Are those yours?

122
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,036
是的
Yeah, that's right.

123
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:51,066
能麻烦挪一下吗  为我妈妈腾个地方
Would you mind, so my mother could sit down, please?

124
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,060
当然
Oh, sure.

125
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,043
谢谢
Thanks.

126
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,093
你流血了
Oh, you're bleeding.

127
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,050
什么
What?

128
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:03,086
你脖子上有一个抓伤
You have a scratch on your neck.

129
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,043
亲爱的
Honey.

130
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,063
是不是你下出租时
Oh, that must have happened

131
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:08,080
碰到了门呀
When the door hit you getting out of the cab.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,073
哦
Oh, well, I'll just, uh,

133
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:12,036
我去报刊亭那边
I'll-i'll go to the newsstand

134
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:14,013
看看有没有创可贴卖
And see if they have some band-aids.

135
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,096
怎么了
What is it?

136
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:41,000
我有点担心
I'm getting worried.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,046
早晚特勤局探员尸体
It's only a matter of time before

138
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:44,030
会被发现
That FBI agent's body is discovered.

139
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,050
鲍尔的女儿好像在怀疑了
And I think Bauer's daughter is getting suspicious.

140
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,080
我给鲍尔限定的时间交出托尼
Look, I gave Bauer a short window to deliver Tony to me.

141
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
不会很久的
Won't be long.

142
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,066
好了我会通知你
Just stand by until you hear from me.

143
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,066
如果鲍尔的女儿在那之前发现我们了呢
And what if kim bauer makes us before then?

144
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:57,043
你不能冒险被抓
You can't allow yourselves to be taken.

145
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,080
你知道怎么做的
Do what you have to do.

146
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,033
沃克探员  看一下你的耳机
Agent walker, let me see your comm unit.

147
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,073
我要调试一下频率
I want to adjust this frequency.

148
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:24,093
我的被干扰了
It's interrupting mine.

149
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,090
谢谢
Thanks.

150
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,070

151
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,073
-别动  -杰克

152
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,083
司机  继续开车
Driver, just keep going

153
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,096
不会伤你们的
And no one gets hurt.

154
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:37,066
你们俩  慢慢的把抢拿出来
Both of you, I want you to slowly

155
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,023
放在地上
Draw your weapons, put them on the floor

156
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,050
踢到我这边来
And slide them to me.

157
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,020
-杰克  -快点
- Jack  - Do it!

158
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,026
不要再为难我了
Don't make this any harder than it already is.

159
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:50,046
把抢给我  否则我就杀了他
Give me your weapon or I will kill him.

160
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:53,073
杰克  你不会下手的
Come on, Jack, you're not gonna kill anyone.

161
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,033
快把抢给我
Give me your weapon! now!

162
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,090
司机  把手拷在方向盘上
Driver, I want you to handcuff

163
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,000
上下都拷好
Yourself to the steering wheel, over and under.

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,046
快点
Do it now.

165
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,043
准备好下高速路
You're gonna exit the freeway when I tell you.

166
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:15,000
在那之前  保持现速
Until then, I want you to maintain speed.

167
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:24,023
现在
Now!

168
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:35,006
沃克探员  怎么了  沃克探员
Agent Walker, what's happening? agent Walker?

169
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:38,026
押送罪犯的车脱离了警卫车队
Comm, the prisoner transport has split from the convoy.

170
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:40,030
蕾妮  我是詹尼斯  听到请回话
Renee, it's Janis, do you read me?

171
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,003
蕾妮
Renee!

172
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:45,023
听到请回话
Are you reading me?

173
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:46,053
沃克探员  什么情况
Agent Walker, what's your 20?

174
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:48,003
沃克探员  请回答
Agent Walker, please respond.

175
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:50,070
杰克  为什么这么做
Jack, why?

176
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,090
我女儿在他们手里
They've got my daughter.

177
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,076
不可能的
That's not possible.

178
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,093
我按你的要求派弗兰克探员保护她
I deployed agent Franks to watch over her, like you asked.

179
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,013
弗兰克探员已经死了
Agent franks is dead.

180
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:59,056
这些人是托尼一伙的
The people that are working with tony

181
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:00,080
金在他们的监视之下
Have operatives with kim right now.

182
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,086
-杰克  -他们要我帮托尼逃跑
- Jack! - They threatened to kill her

183
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:03,020
否则就杀了她
If I don't break him out.

184
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,010
杰克  够了
Jack, that's enough!

185
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,013
你这个贱人
You son of a bitch.

186
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,063
我们下高速了  现在呢
Okay, we're on taft. what now?

187
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,000
你会看见康涅狄格隧道的入口
You'll see the entrance to the Connecticut avenue tunnel.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
走北边的车道
Take the north lane.

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,016
继续沿街行驶
Continue down this street.

190
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:15,040
走北边进隧道
Go towards the tunnel, north.

191
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
空中监视  还看得到嫌犯的车吗
Aerial bravo three, do you still have a visual?

192
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,083
是的
Affirmative.

193
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,056
剩下的车队
The follow vehicles in the convoy

194
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:21,096
会在下个出口下高速
Are getting off at the next exit,

195
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:23,023
我们会继续追踪
And will be doubling back.

196
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,083
我们在卫星追踪嫌犯的车
We've got prisoner transport on satellite.

197
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,073
他们冲着哈德森去了
They're heading west on hudson.

198
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,026
等下
Wait.

199
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,020
他们进入康涅狄格隧道入口了
They're pulling into the connecticut avenue tunnel.

200
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
我看不到
I'm losing visual.

201
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,063
重复  看不到了
Repeat, I am losing visual.

202
00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:35,020
连线发射器
Pull up the transponder locators.

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,043
我们在隧道里了
Okay, we're in the tunnel.

204
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:41,076
我在25英里处
You'll see me parked in

205
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:43,023
的紧急停车道上
The emergency lane about a quarter mile in.

206
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:50,016
你停在那辆SUV后面
Okay, I want you to pull behind that suv.

207
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,070
杰克  我能理解你的原因
Jack, please. I understand your reasons,

208
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,020
但是你不能这么做
But you can't do this.

209
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,033
不  我不能让金出于危险之中  解开托尼
No, what I can't do is risk kim's life. uncuff Tony.

210
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,073
给我钥匙
Give me the keys.

211
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:14,006
拷住她  我来管这个
Cuff her. I'll take him.

212
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,046
他们摄像监视着金
They have a camera on kim.

213
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,030
我不相信托尼会放了她
I don't trust Tony to let her go.

214
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,070
求你了
Please, I'm begging you,

215
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,070
竭尽所能去救她  求你了
Do whatever you have to to save her, please.

216
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:33,053
杰克
Jack.

217
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,016
枪给我
The gun.

218
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:41,090
把自己铐上
Cuff yourself.

219
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:56,016
快
Come on.

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,026
你把鲍尔带来干什么
What are you bringing Bauer for?

221
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,073
托尼  我听从了你们的一切指示
Tony, I've done everything you've asked.

222
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,076
放了金
Just let Kim go.

223
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:06,073
-放了她  -上车
- Let her go! - Get in the car.

224
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,090
托尼  你想干什么
So what are you doing, Tony?

225
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,076
我们不需要人质  尤其是他
We don't need a hostage, okay-- specially not him.

226
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:13,063
把他毙了  我们远走高飞
Shoot him already and let's get out of here.

227
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,020
卡拉  你真是没有远见
You're not seeing the big picture, Cara.

228
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,053
你们组织将能发射生化武器
Your people are gonna be able to launch the biological attacks--

229
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,056
就和原计划一样
Just as they originally planned.

230
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:19,073
怎么做
How?

231
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:21,000
我们已经丢了毒气罐
We lost the canister.

232
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,040
病原体已经不在我们手中
We don't have the pathogen anymore.

233
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,023
我们有杰克就够
We have Jack.

234
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:26,013
病原体在他的血液里
The pathogen's in his blood,

235
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:27,016
就在他的器官里
It's in his organs.

236
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:31,070
我们可以从他体内摄取所有病原体
We'll be able to harvest everything we need from his body.

237
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,036
你以为我让你派人马去盯着金·鲍尔干什么
Why do you think I had you put those operatives on Kim Bauer?

238
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:38,016
你们组织 仍需要证明杰克是活菌体
Your people are still going to need proof that Jack's viable.

239
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:41,083
派个生物学家在军事基地等我们
Have one of your biochemists meet us at the complex.

240
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,013
再次感谢你能赶来
Thank you again for coming.

241
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,056
皮尔斯探员
You can thank me, Agent Pierce,

242
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:12,036
你可以对我和盘托出  以表达对我的感激
By telling me what this is all about.

243
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:14,036
好  可是我们时间紧迫
All right, sir, but we don't have much time.

244
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:16,093
你暗示说这件事关系到奥利维亚·泰勒
You implied it had something to do with Olivia Taylor.

245
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:17,096
没错
Yes, sir.

246
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:19,063
几小时前
A few hours ago,

247
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:22,063
乔纳斯·霍奇斯在联调局总部外遇害
Jonas Hodges was killed outside FBI headquarters.

248
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:24,020
老天爷
My god.

249
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,000
当局相信他被害是因为
Now, authorities believe he was murdered to keep him

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,033
有人杀人灭口
From implicating others

251
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:30,033
以此保住牵扯进生化武器人物的秘密
Who were involved in the bioweapon attacks,

252
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,090
可我怀疑可能另有隐情
But I suspect there may be another scenario.

253
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,033
我有理由相信泰勒小姐
And I have reason to believe that Ms. Taylor

254
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,080
可能涉案
Might be involved.

255
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,020
真是骇人听闻的指控啊  皮尔斯探员
That is an outrageous accusation, Agent Pierce.

256
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,066
奥利维亚的确神通广大
Olivia is capable of many things,

257
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:48,030
-可我不相信她会杀人  -卡宁先生
- But I can't believe committing murder is one of them.- mr. kanin

258
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,096
请你听我把话说完
Please, just hear me out.

259
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:52,000
总统同意将霍奇斯
After the president agreed

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,003
列入证人保护计划后
To a witness protection deal for Hodges,

261
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:58,056
泰勒小姐对我说  她想要霍奇斯的命
Ms. Taylor made a comment to me about wanting to see Hodges dead.

262
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:00,083
是他害死了她弟弟
He was responsible for her brother's death.

263
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,086
她只是在泄愤而已
She was venting.

264
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,026
我也本这么以为
I thought so, too.

265
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:06,043
可后来她在办公室接见了一位老同事
Until she met in her office with an old colleague of hers,

266
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:08,010
名叫马丁·柯里尔
A man named Martin Collier.

267
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,066
我认识柯里尔
I know Collier.

268
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:11,053
那你应该知道他的作风
Then you know the sort of man he is.

269
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,086
对
I do.

270
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:15,023
可这也不能证明他们是共谋
But none of this constitutes proof of complicity.

271
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:16,076
对  先生  因此我需要您
No, sir. that's why I need you

272
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:18,066
登陆数字录音系统
To access the digital recording system.

273
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:21,066
看他们的谈话是否被录音
To see if their conversation was recorded.

274
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,003
你在唆使我闯入一间办公室
Agent, you're asking me to break into an office

275
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,020
而它已经不属于我
That's no longer mine.

276
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,050
然后进入代理联席幕僚长的分类录音系统
And access classified recordings of the acting chief of staff.

277
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,086
卡宁先生  如果我的怀疑没错

Have you noticed anyone with a camera or cell phone?

418
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:39,060
或者是笔记本电脑
Or a laptop.

419
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,093
什么
What?

420
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:42,033
我和一对夫妻说过话
There's a couple that I've been talking to,

421
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,060
他们就坐在我旁边
They're sitting right next to me.

422
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,093
那个男的有个笔记本电脑打开正对着我
The man has an open laptop right in front of me.

423
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,023
你能描述一下那个男的吗
Can you give me a description?

424
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:48,046
可以  他头发很长
Yeah, he's got long hair.

425
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,090
很高
He's tall...

426
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,050
-金  -我很感谢
- Kim? - Oh, well I appreciate that.

427
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,076
-好的  谢谢  -金  怎么了
- Okay, thank you. - Kim, what's wrong?

428
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,026
请转告行李处的
Please let baggage claim know

429
00:20:57,026 --> 00:20:59,013
下次我会更小心的
That I will be much more careful next time.

430
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:00,096
金
Kim?

431
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:02,000
克罗伊
Chloe,

432
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
-你听到了吗  -我在
- Do you read me? - I'm here.

433
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:04,050
那些雇佣兵可能向金下手
The operatives may be moving on Kim.

434
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,000
通知机场警察  要他们不要轻举妄动
Alert airport police, have them lock down the terminal.

435
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,030
告诉机场保安正常巡逻
Tell airport security to maintain patrols.

436
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,020
别引起怀疑
Do nothing to arouse suspicion.

437
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,023
好的
Okay.

438
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:13,090
好的  再见
Okay, bye.

439
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,080
金  我们看见你在打电话
Kim, we saw you were on the phone.

440
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,016
以为你有麻烦了
We thought there might be a problem.

441
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,033
-需要帮忙吗  -不不
- Do you need some help? - No, no, no.

442
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:19,010
没有什么麻烦  我只是把电动牙刷
There's no problem. I just left my electric

443
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,016
忘记在行李箱了
Toothbrush on in my luggage.

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,043
-说他们弄坏了我的锁  -好吧
- That they broke my lock. - Nice.

445
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,053
你拿到登机牌了吗
Did you get your boarding pass?

446
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:25,093
拿到了  就在这里
Oh, yeah. It's right here.

447
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:34,000
她的行李安检时出了问题
There was, uh, a little security problem with her luggage.

448
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:36,093
我想他们再小心也不为过
I guess they can never be too careful.

449
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,003
你还好吧
You okay?

450
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:52,053
是的  我很好
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

451
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,043
只是我第一次离开
This is the first time that I've been apart

452
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:55,083
我的女儿
From my little girl.

453
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,023
所以有些急着回到她身边
And I'm just a little anxious to get back to see her.

454
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:02,096
你们想看看她的相片吗
Would you like to see a picture of her?

455
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:05,013
当然
Sure.

456
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:06,066
我这里有一张
I've got one in here.

457
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,006
找到了
Here it is.

458
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:15,000
在哪  这张
Where is... yeah.

459
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
她叫泰莉
Her name's Teri.

460
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,086
她真可爱
She's adorable.

461
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,046
谢谢
Thank you.

462
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:26,026
那个是我的丈夫
That's my husband actually.

463
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,040
这个是
This is... ah...

464
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,046
干掉她
Take her.

465
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:43,040
不
No!

466
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,020
趴下  趴下
Get down! Get down!

467
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,040
都趴下
Everyone down!

468
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,083
二级警备  二级警备
Code two, code two!

469
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,013
疑犯持有武器
Suspects are armed!

470
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:54,020
趴下
Get down!

471
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,063
沃克
Walker.

472
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,033
我是金·鲍尔  保安都中枪了
It's Kim Bauer. Security's down.

473
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:42,046
-机场警察在哪里  -他们正赶去你那边
- Where are the airport police?! - They're mobilizing to you now.

474
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,060
那些雇佣兵怎么样了
What about the operatives?

475
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,050
那女的死了  男的正逃跑
The woman is dead. The man is getting away.

476
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,056
金  我们要通过他找到你父亲
Kim, we need him to find your father.

477
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,000
他朝那个方向走的
What direction is he headed?

478
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,023
沃克探员
Agent Walker?

479
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,096
见鬼
Damn it!

480
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:55,013
金  金
Kim? Kim?!

481
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,070
奥利维亚
Olivia.

482
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,046
我一直喜欢你这点  伊桑
I always liked that about you, Ethan.

483
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:29,003
就算是我小时候
Even when I was a little girl,

484
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:31,000
你也会在我进门时起立迎接
You always stood up when I came into the room.

485
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,026
恶习难改
Old habits die hard.

486
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:35,060
你从我的办公室带走了些东西
You removed something from my office.

487
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,000
我想要回来
I want it back.

488
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:38,030
我先前跟你说过  你随时可以拿回去
I told you before, you're welcome to them.

489
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,070
你非常清楚我不是在说那些文件
You know damn well I'm not talking about those files.

490
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,063
是吗
Do I?

491
00:24:43,063 --> 00:24:46,060
伊桑  我发现那个电子录音机了
Ethan, I found the digital recorder.

492
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,033
现在把你拿走的还给我
Now give me what you took,

493
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,053
否则我会命令门外的安保警员
Or I'll order the security officers outside this door

494
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,023
对你进行光身检查
To strip search you.

495
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,090
好吧  我确实有录音
All right, I do have a recording.

496
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,050
不过是我过去在职那段时间的
It's a personal account of my last days

497
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,080
私人记录
In service to this administration

498
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,060
所以我觉得我有权拥有它
And I think I'm entitled to it.

499
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,050
没人有权利将敏感文件
No one is entitled to take sensitive material

500
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,006
带出白宫
Out of the White House.

501
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:13,073
那么你现在是在担心国家安全咯
Oh, now it's national security you're worried about?

502
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:17,006
事实上是的
As a matter of fact, yes.

503
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:20,046
我还保留着权限
Well, I still have my clearances.

504
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:22,066
为什么我们不在这里一起听这些录音呢
Why don't we listen to the recording together.

505
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:26,013
你现在没有职位来下达命令的  伊桑
You are in no position to dictate terms, Ethan.

506
00:25:26,013 --> 00:25:28,083
你现在至少违反了10条联邦法条
You're in violation of at least ten federal laws.

507
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,096
你这么害怕的是什么  奥利维亚
What are you so afraid of, Olivia?

508
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:34,010
什么事有如此严重的指控
What's on there that's so incriminating?

509
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,006
我不是那个受到指控的人
I'm not the one facing incrimination.

510
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:39,050
你才是
You are.

511
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,043
但是如果你现在把录音交出来
But give me the recording right now

512
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:44,060
我会把那些指控都撤销
And I'll see to it that no charges are filed.

513
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:50,093
最后一次机会  伊桑
Last chance, Ethan.

514
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:02,053
在他身上找一个存储卡
Search him for a data card.

515
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:03,070
我被无故拘留
I'm being held without cause.

516
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,046
我要求和泰勒总统谈话
I demand to speak to president Taylor.

517
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:08,020
是总统阁下下达命令拘留你的
It was the president who ordered his detention.

518
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,033
如果是这样的话  我希望听她亲口说
If that's true, I want to hear it from her directly.

519
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:14,013
现在是犯罪事件
Well, this is a criminal matter now.

520
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:17,050
考虑到卡宁先生和总统阁下的私交
Considering her personal relationship

521
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,036
总统觉得介入调查
With Mr. Kanin, the president doesn't deem it appropriate

522
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,043
很不合适
To intrude on the investigation.

523
00:26:24,023 --> 00:26:28,020
请站起来  卡宁先生
Please stand up, Mr. Kanin.

524
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,046
胳臂抬起来
Arms up.

525
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,056
你将铸成大错
You're making a terrible mistake.

526
00:26:32,056 --> 00:26:36,096
泰勒女士这是严重越权行事
Ms. Taylor is grossly overstepping her authority.

527
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,080
探员  谢谢你
Thank you, agent.

528
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,033
把他带走
Process him out.

529
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,080
卡宁先生  请跟我来
Come with me, Mr. Kanin.

530
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,023
你根本就不明白
I don't think you understand

531
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:01,096
你所作所为的严重性
The seriousness of what you're doing.

532
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:05,086
我可不认为你就明白
I don't think you do.

533
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:42,020
霍布森探员  剩下几步路我来吧
Agent Hobson, I can take him the rest of the way.

534
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,013
好的
Fine.

535
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,093
皮尔斯探员  她肯定隐瞒了什么
She's definitely hiding something, agent Pierce.

536
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:53,043
还好我早就猜到了
Lucky for us I'm a paranoid son of a bitch.

537
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:04,050
我能问一下另一张数据卡是什么吗
May I ask what was on the other data card?

538
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,040
什么都没有  是空白的
Nothing. It's blank.

539
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,060
我可以拿到通讯办公室的进入许可
Well, I can try to get you into the communications office

540
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,016
以便你听录音
So you can listen to that.

541
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:12,060
太冒险了  也没那个必要
Too risky, and unnecessary.

542
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,093
我车里就有一台录音机的播放设备
I have a companion device to the recorder in my car.

543
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:20,076
听起来像是你一直在  期待这件事发生
It sounds like you were... expecting this.

544
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:24,090
和奥利维亚打交道是需要未雨绸缪的
One has to be prepared when you're dealing with Olivia.

545
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,063
我一有发现就通知你
I'll let you know what I find.

546
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:25,050
你们要干什么
What are you doing?

547
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:29,026
你们要干什么
What are you doing?!

548
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:30,080
杰克  我们要利用你
We're gonna use you

549
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,010
来重新研制生化武器
To reconstitute the bioweapon, Jack.

550
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,056
脸朝下放在桌上
On the table facedown.

551
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,046
要花多长时间
How long till we know?

552
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,073
看情况吧
It depends.

553
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,026
什么情况
On what?

554
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,040
要根据他脊髓液里病原体的浓度来定
On the levels of pathogen in his spinal fluid.

555
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,080
给我一个大致时间
Give me a time frame.

556
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,063
15分钟
15 minutes.

557
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:54,033
好的  开始吧
Good. Get started.

558
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,066
托尼
Tony...

559
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,050
托尼
Tony!

560
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,076
-住手  -要先给他注射抗痉挛药物
- Don't! - Got to give him something to control the seizure.

561
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:01,086
让他一动不动的
I need him completely immobilized.

562
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:20,080
一知道鲍尔到底有没有用我会马上和组织联系
I'll contact the group as soon as we know if Bauer's viable.

563
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,026
没错  可我先要和你谈谈
Yeah, look, I need to talk to you first.

564
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:24,056
谈什么
What is it?

565
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,056
我想在组织里有更高的地位
I want a larger role in the organization.

566
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:29,040
而且我觉得现在是获得公认的最好时机
And I think this is a good time to make my case.

567
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,000
托尼  我们之前谈过的  是吧
Tony, we've gone over this before, okay?

568
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,010
这不合规定
It's not how it works.

569
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,026
你不能要求加入
You don't ask in.

570
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:34,043
只能是我们邀请你
You're invited in.

571
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:35,093
好吧  那帮我搞到一份邀请
All right, then get me an invitation.

572
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:37,093
听着  完成今天的任务后
Look, after what I've done today,

573
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,063
我认为那是我应得的
I think I've earned it.

574
00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:43,076
你确实足智多谋
You have been resourceful, that's true.

575
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:45,010
但是
Still...

576
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,083
我知道你和上头直接联系
Look, I know you talk to the top guy.

577
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:51,003
我只是要你安排我们见一次面
All I'm asking is that you get us in the same room together.

578
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:52,026
我会毛遂自荐
I'll sell myself.

579
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:53,056
那不是个好方法
I don't think that would be the right approach.

580
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,043
-为什么不是  -因为他谨言慎行  托尼
- Why not? - Because he's careful to a fault, Tony.

581
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:58,026
而且他对他的匿名看的很重
And he's very protective of his anonymity.

582
00:30:58,026 --> 00:31:00,056
我能理解
I can appreciate that.

583
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:01,083
但我也有底线
But the bottom line is,

584
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,096
没有我  就不会有这次行动
Without me, this operation never happens.

585
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:08,060
现在你能够影响他的决策
Now you have influence over him.

586
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,076
他相信你
He trusts you.

587
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,036
你可以说服他
You can convince him.

588
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,080
我以前见你做过
I've seen you do it before.

589
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,040
这次不同
This is different.

590
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,020
没错
That's right.

591
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,016
这次是不同
It is different.

592
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:21,096
这次是为了我
This time it's for me.

593
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,066
我准备好抽取脊髓液了
I'm ready to extract the spinal fluid.

594
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:33,000
按住他的头
Hold his head still.

595
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,030
马丁  我给你说  他知道了
He knows, Martin, I'm telling you.

596
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,060
不  奥利维亚  他不知道
No, Olivia, he doesn't.

597
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,050
最坏的情况会是  他产生了怀疑
Worst case, he has a suspicion.

598
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,087
我是说他根本没有时间
I mean he never actually had the time

599
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,016
去听那段录音
to listen to the recording.

600
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:05,063
是的
No.

601
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:07,023
好  而且他也没机会听了
Okay, and he never will,

602
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:08,070
因为你已经毁了数据卡  对吧
Because you destroyed the data card, right?

603
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,056
当然
Of course.

604
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:10,063
那么我们安全了  是吧
Then we're fine, all right?

605
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:14,000
只要你保持清晰的思路  别慌就行
So long as you keep thinking clearly and don't panic.

606
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,026
马丁  你忘了是我结束了他的职业生涯
You're forgetting I ended this man's career, Martin.

607
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:19,036
他不会错过扳倒我的任何机会  永远不会
He won't let me off the hook, ever.

608
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:21,040
你是总统的女儿  对吧
You're the president's daughter, okay?

609
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,020
相信我  在没有确凿证据前
Trust me, no one will come after you

610
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,040
没人会找你的麻烦
Without hard evidence.

611
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,083
尤其是伊桑·卡宁
Least of all Ethan Kanin.

612
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:28,016
奥利维亚
Olivia.

613
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:29,063
我得挂了
I've got to go.

614
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:31,056
总统在找你
The president's been looking for you.

615
00:32:31,056 --> 00:32:33,040
-她要你马上去总统办公室  -发生什么事了
- She needs you in the oval office. - What's going on?

616
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,046
机场发现情况
There's a situation unfolding

617
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:35,083
牵涉到托尼·阿尔梅达
At the airport involving Tony Almeida.

618
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,096
马上要就此事开简报会了
We're about to be briefed,

619
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,066
-她想让你参加  -好的
- And she wants you in on it. - Okay.

620
00:32:40,013 --> 00:32:41,073
一切还好吧
Everything all right?

621
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:44,076
是的  很好
Yes, fine.

622
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,006
在那边
Over here.

623
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,026
你看见他去哪边了吗
Did you see which way he went?

624
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,023
一片混乱  到处都有人在跑
It was chaos. There were people running everywhere.

625
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,020
詹尼斯  我是蕾妮
Janis, It's Renee.

626
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,020
说
Go ahead.

627
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,083
男嫌犯还在逃
The male operative remains at large.

628
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,050
金·鲍尔不见了
Kim Bauer is missing.

629
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,033
她不是去追他就是被挟持了
Either she went after him, or she's a hostage.

630
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,083
对所有通道发出优先警告
Issue a priority alert across all channels.

631
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,096
警官  我叫金·鲍尔
Officer, my name is Kim Bauer.

632
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:30,096
我正在追踪刚在航空集散站开枪的人
I'm following the man who shot up the terminal.

633
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:34,043
你得和调查局的蕾妮·沃克探员联系
You need to contact special agent Renee Walker with the FBI.

634
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,070
金  我是蕾妮  请讲
Kim, it's Renee. Go ahead.

635
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,070
我找到他了  他在南停车场车库
I've got him. he's in the south parking garage.

636
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,070
你现在是否看到他
Are you in visual contact?

637
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,013
没  他在我的楼上
No. He's on one of the upper levels

638
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,033
我在出口处
I'm at the exit.

639
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,063
收到  我们马上就到
Copy that. We're coming towards you.

640
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:02,040
快
Hurry!

641
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:23,000
坚持住  后援马上就到
Hang on! Help is on the way.

642
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:53,010
不
No!

643
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:18,093
金
Kim!

644
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,006
给你
Here.

645
00:36:22,006 --> 00:36:23,015
你受伤了  我检查下你的手臂
You're hurt. Let me see your arm.

646
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,045
没事  听我说  蕾妮
No, listen to me, Renee.

647
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:25,068
那台笔记本上有摄像头
That laptop has the camera

648
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:27,009
他们用它来跟踪我
They were using to track me.

649
00:36:27,009 --> 00:36:28,070
用的是D11反向路由器
With a D-11 inverse router,

650
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,009
我们也许能反追踪那个信号
We may be able to back trace the signal

651
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:32,042
从而找到绑架我爸爸的人
To the people that have my father.

652
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:34,049
我以前是反恐小组的系统分析员
I worked at CTU, systems analyst.

653
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:37,009
你们办公室有人可以帮我们吗
Is there anyone back at your office that can help us with this?

654
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:38,052
有  克罗伊?奥布赖恩
Yeah, I've got Chloe O'brian standing by.

655
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:40,062
和她通电话
Get her on the phone.

656
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:38,026
一旦你做了决定并一干到底
Once this happens, once it goes through,

657
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:39,057
就没有回头路可走了
You can never go back.

658
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,042
你后半生的日子恐怕就难过了
You will live with it for the rest of your life.

659
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,002
我不需要你们来给我训话
I don't need a lecture on conscience from you of all people.

660
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:47,029
我已认真考虑过此事
I have thought this through.

661
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:51,075
我不能忍受让那个畜生逍遥法外
What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this.

662
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:53,082
他必须为他所做的付出代价
He has to pay for what he did.

663
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:02,005
病毒含量比预期的要高
The virus load is even higher than we hoped for.

664
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:04,005
每单位脊髓液中含有十多个单位病毒
Ten-plus in spinal fluid alone.

665
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,012
不足以重组病毒
Not enough to reconstitute the pathogen, of course.

666
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:09,029
我们需要他的器官
We'll still need his organs for that.

667
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:11,019
他看起来不太好
He doesn't look too good.

668
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:13,095
他还能活多长时间
How much longer does he have?

669
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:17,085
几个小时吧  具体时间不能确定
A couple of hours, give or take.

670
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:25,055
如果他在我们提取病毒以前死了怎么办
And what happens if he dies before we extract the pathogen?

671
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,085
最好是能保证病毒携带者存活
Obviously, it's optimal to keep the host alive,

672
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:30,085
但病原体可以在他死后多存活两小时
But the pathogen could survive up to two hours after death,

673
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,085
或者更久
Sometimes even longer.

674
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:33,065
事实上  唯一除掉病毒的方法
In fact, the only sure way to destroy it

675
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:34,068
就是放在500摄氏度的高温环境中
Is by exposure to extreme

676
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:37,022
需要五百摄氏度以上的高温
Temperatures above 500-degrees celsius.

677
00:38:38,062 --> 00:38:40,078
务必把那写在报告中
Make sure you put that in your report.

678
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:43,082
我会的  我已经发到你电脑上去了
I have, and I've already uploaded it to your computer.

679
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:46,088
很好  准备转移他
Good. Get him ready to move.

680
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:49,058
拿担架
Get the stretcher.

681
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:54,025
鲍尔有利用价值  但你需要保证相应设备
Bauer is viable, But you'll need to secure a facility.

682
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:55,082
那个好说
That won't be a problem

683
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,065
你一直都非常清楚
As long as you're absolutely certain

684
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:59,049
这方面我们会搞定的
That we can accomplish this.

685
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,055
我们已经啃下最硬的骨头了  艾伦
We've already done the hard part, Alan.

686
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,021
据我所知
And from what I understand,

687
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:04,072
有了适用的设备  纯血样提取
With the proper equipment, the actual extraction

688
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:07,009
以及人工器官移植就不成问题了
And bioengineering is fairly straightforward.

689
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:11,032
好的卡拉  我会和其他人联系  干得好
Okay, Cara, I'll contact the others. Good work.

690
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:14,029
他们要知道  该谢的还有阿尔梅达
They should know they have Almeida to thank for this.

691
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:16,075
是他意识到鲍尔是个问题解决途径
He's the one who realized Bauer was a possible source.

692
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,049
转达我的谢意
Relay my gratitude.

693
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:21,068
我认为你可以考虑更长远一些
I think you should consider going farther than that.

694
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,045
什么意思   你有何高见
Farther? What did you have in mind?

695
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:28,035
托尼和我们一条心
Tony believes in what we're doing.

696
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:30,058
他想担当更重要的角色
He wants to play a larger role.

697
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:33,068
听起来有点不靠谱
That sounds premature to me.

698
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:34,095
事实上  艾伦
The thing is, Alan,

699
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:37,055
如果我们不礼贤下士的话
If we don't make a significant gesture,

700
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:39,078
恐怕我们会失去他这个人才
I'm afraid we may lose him.

701
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:42,025
我甚至都不了解他  卡拉
I don't even know this man, Cara.

702
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:45,039
那么你就该去了解他
Then you should get to know him.

703
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,005
你该不会是建议我和他见面吧
Are you suggesting I meet with him?

704
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:50,072
听着  我强调的是
Look, all I'm saying is

705
00:39:50,072 --> 00:39:54,005
他会成为组织里振臂一呼  应者云集的人物
That he would be a very useful voice in the mix.

706
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:56,042
他的实战经验弥补了
His field experience fills a knowledge gap,

707
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:58,088
我们计划中理论上的不足
In regards to our logistics and planning.

708
00:39:58,088 --> 00:40:01,052
你这么说  是要大力保举他咯
Well, coming from you, That's a hell of a recommendation.

709
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:02,075
他就是不二人选了  艾伦
There's no one better, alan.

710
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:05,018
你不能像你查清组织里
And it's not as if you haven't vetted

711
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:06,076
其他每个成员的底子那样办
every other member of the group.

712
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:10,062
也许是时候该和他见个面了
Maybe it is time that he and I met.

713
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:16,019
我半小时之内到你那里
I could be there where you are in the next half hour.

714
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,025
你过来
You're coming here?

715
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:21,019
我认为这会是个好点子
I think it would be a good idea

716
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,015
如果由我亲自监督转移鲍尔的事
If I supervised Bauer's transfer myself;

717
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,005
我会让别人觉得轻松点  不是吗
Make the others feel at ease, don't you think?

718
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,022
但是拉卡  我要亲眼见下阿尔梅达
But, Cara, I'll look Almeida in the eye,

719
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:31,092
如果他有哪点让我看得不爽
And if, for any reason, I don't like what I see,

720
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,029
你清楚后果
You understand.

721
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:35,092
我不会让他活着离开
I can't let him walk out of that meeting alive.

722
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:39,062
我知道
I understand.

723
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,025
他想见你
He wants to meet you.

724
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:50,025
他一会就到
He'll be here in little while.

725
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:53,092
谢谢
Thank you.

726
00:40:58,012 --> 00:41:00,019
一切看你自己表现了
It's up to you now.

727
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:10,029
把轮床推过来点
Wheel the gurney closer.

728
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:43,068
他太虚弱了走不了那么远
He's too weak to have gotten very far.

729
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:44,055
掩护南边出口  我去这边
Cover the north exit. I'll go this way.

730
00:42:44,055 --> 00:42:49,055
