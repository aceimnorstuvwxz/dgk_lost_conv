1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,050
《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:16,052
找到毒气罐了吗
Have you secured the canister?

3
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:17,087
阁下  恐怕还没有
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

4
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:19,069
我们的疑犯逃出了封锁线
Our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter.

5
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,033
你们不是说封锁那区域了吗
I was told that the area was locked down.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,020
-怎么回事  -他有帮凶
- What happened? - He had help

7
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:24,083
是托尼·阿尔梅达
From Tony Almeida.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,083
阿尔梅达
Almeida?

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,087
他为我们做事的啊
He was working for us.

10
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:28,040
这只是表象
It only appeared that way.

11
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:29,087
他显然是在执行自己的计划
Apparently he was pursuing his own agenda,

12
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:31,084
想要弄到毒气罐
Trying to get his hands on the canister.

13
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:33,027
我们已召集所有人员重新部署寻找线索
We're all regrouping to develop leads.

14
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,071
我可能有一条线索
I may have one.

15
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:36,068
在霍奇斯被拘捕时
As hodges was taken into custody,

16
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,065
他叫嚣说  在他被捕后
He yelled at me about some larger group

17
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,095
还有更大的组织会继续行动
That would continue on after his arrest.

18
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:43,002
我们得跟他谈谈
We need to talk to him.

19
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,049
打电话给司法部长
I need you to call the attorney general

20
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:48,049
起草一份给乔纳斯·霍奇斯的证人保护协议
And draft a witness protection agreement for Jonas Hodges.

21
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:50,019
没有别的让他开口的法子了
There's no other way he'll talk.

22
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:52,056
你的亲生儿子死在他手里  更不要提
This man murdered your son, not to mention

23
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:54,090
数以百计的无辜平民
Hundreds of innocent civilians.

24
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,017
有什么我可以为你做的吗
Is there anything else that I can do for you?

25
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,084
杀了乔纳斯·霍奇斯之外  我别无他求
Other than kill Jonas Hodges, no.

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,014
我不是这个意思
I didn't mean that.

27
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,044
你是对的
You know, you're right.

28
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,041
我们不该在电话里讨论这个
We shouldn't be talking about this over the phone.

29
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,074
你什么时候能到白宫
How soon can you be at the White House?

30
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,008
-15分钟怎么样  -很好
- How's 15 minutes sound? - Good.

31
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,035
我们计划在明年初
The plan was to launch simultaneous attacks

32
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,085
对多个大城市发动同步攻击
Early next year in multiple cities,

33
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:17,085
公众就会意识到  政府无法保全他们
So the public would finally see that the government can't protect them.

34
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:20,032
他们会要求采取果断举措  我们就乘虚而入
They'd demand drastic measures, and we'd step in.

35
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,059
我们会支持那些想摧毁这个国家的敌人
We were going to supply the enemies that want to destroy this country.

36
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:24,099
张三李四王二麻子
Muhammed this, Achmed that.

37
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,090
霍奇斯先生  我要你说出同党的名字
Mr. Hodges, I need the names of the people that you are working with.

38
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:29,073
-我没有  -我要名单
- I don't have them. - I want the names.

39
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,003
我真不知道
I don't know any!

40
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,060
我们只需今天再发动一次袭击
Another attack today is all we need

41
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:34,050
就能让整个事态发展到崩溃的边缘
To push this thing right over the edge.

42
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:36,090
现在绝不是撤退的时候
This is no time to pull back.

43
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,027
我建议我们今天就拿着毒气罐
I say we take that canister

44
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:41,071
-去完成任务  -我联系一下组织
- And finish the job off today. - I'll contact the group.

45
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,001
这次行动会被归咎于这个人
The attack will be attributed to this man--

46
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:45,088
吉布安·阿尔扎利安
Jibraan Al-zarian.

47
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,062
我们讨论的是几个小时之内
We're talking about launching a new operation

48
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:49,012
展开一次新行动
In the next few hours

49
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,002
却只凭一个毒气罐
And with only one canister.

50
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,005
行动计划早就有了
The plan for this operation was already in place.

51
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,022
我们只不过是加快了点脚步
We'd just be accelerating the timetable.

52
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,072
乔纳斯·霍奇斯是一个我型我素的人
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,046
现在组织已经成功地除掉了他
And the group is well rid of him,

54
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,086
但他疯狂的行为  对我们倒不无益处
But, in his lunacy, he did us a favor.

55
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:01,096
我们要抓住这次机会
I say we take it.

56
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:04,007
哈米德
Hamid!

57
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:05,073
闭嘴就没事
Keep your mouth shut and no one gets hurt.

58
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,017
-明白了吗  -是的
- You understand?! - Yes!

59
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:12,034
以下情节发生在凌晨4点至5点间
The following takes place between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.

60
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,089
你还需要多久
How much more time do you need?

61
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:45,083
资料快下载完了
The material's almost finished downloading.

62
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,061
财务记录也准备好了
Financial records are in place.

63
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:52,058
我还需要15分钟来更改时间戳印
I'm gonna need about another 15 minutes to alter the time stamps.

64
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:55,062
很好
Good.

65
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:10,041
我现在把封条撕下来
I'm gonna take this off.

66
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,067
你要敢叫  你跟你弟弟就没命了
You yell for help, you and your brother die.

67
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:13,074
明白吗
Understand?

68
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,012
你们是什么人
Who are you people?

69
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,069
你们把宣扬伊斯兰圣战的东西放进我电脑
You're putting Jihadi propaganda on my computer.

70
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,093
还有这些武器  你们
These weapons-- you're...

71
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,000
你们想让我看起来像个恐怖分子
You're trying to make me look like a terrorist.

72
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,050
你们为什么要这样做
Why are you doing this?

73
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:41,090
吉布安  听我说
Listen to me, jibraan.

74
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:45,031
你只需要知道一件事
There's only one thing you need to know.

75
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:48,048
如果你不照我说的做
If you don't do exactly as I say,

76
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:53,018
你会眼睁睁看着你弟弟死在你面前
You're going to watch your younger brother die right in front of your eyes.

77
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:57,092
然后  我也会杀了你
And then... I'm gonna kill you.

78
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:03,072
但是  如果你合作
However... if you cooperate...

79
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:07,039
你们两兄弟有可能活下来
...there's a good chance the two of you will live through this.

80
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:12,030
你想要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

81
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,014
首先
First off...

82
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,027
你要面对摄像机念这段声明
You're going to read this statement in front of a camera,

83
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:20,004
要念得有诚意
And you're going to read it like you mean it.

84
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,004
不  这太扯淡了
No, this is insane.

85
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,004
我不能念这个
I can't read this.

86
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,038
我不干
I'm not going to do this.

87
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:26,055
好啊  听起来你好像觉得自己还有的选了
Okay, see, that sounds to me like you think you have a choice.

88
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,092
求你了  这样不对
Please, this is not right.

89
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,015
你不能这么对我们
You can't do this to us.

90
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:31,022
好吧
Okay, fine.

91
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,022
好  好  求你不要伤害他
Okay, okay, please, please don't hurt him.

92
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:38,076
我会照你说的做
I'll do whatever you say.

93
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,066
好吗
Okay?

94
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,094
给你5分钟把那看一遍
I'll give you five minutes to look that over.

95
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:09,082
我刚用反恐组服务器完成了第一次扫描
I just finished the first sweep with the CTU servers.

96
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,019
完全检测不到有什么活动或聊天记录
There's been no chatter, no activity at all.

97
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,086
你更新监视名单了吗
You updated the watch list?

98
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:14,000
更新了  名单上所有人
Yes, everyone on that list

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,006
都已经在执法机构监视下了
Is already under surveillance by law enforcement.

100
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,036
如果有人要干点什么
If one of them was gonna do something,

101
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:18,070
我们早就发现了
We would know about it.

102
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:20,027
可恶  我们得扩大搜索范围
Damn, well, we're going to have to widen our parameter.

103
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:21,054
扩大到什么程度
To include what?

104
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:26,001
我要你检查华盛顿市区范围的所有穆斯林
I want you to check out every muslim in the Washington D.C. area.

105
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:29,011
目标是敏感职位的政府工作人员
Target anyone who's working in a sensitive government position

106
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:30,044
或是可能受到袭击的区域的人员
Or in a place that might get hit.

107
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:32,025
然后调出在穆斯林社区工作的
Then I want you to start pulling the files

108
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,048
所有政治活动家的档案
On every political activist working in the muslim community.

109
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:37,008
还有  联系移民规划局
Also, I want you to contact INS.

110
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:39,085
我想要最近从伊斯兰国家来的移民名单
I want a list of every recent immigrant from an islamic country.

111
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,086
抱歉  有人听到种族成见的话了吗
Excuse me, has anybody heard of racial profiling?

112
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,096
詹尼斯  别说了
Janis, not now.

113
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:48,006
不  她是对的
No, she's right.

114
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:53,010
你是对的  这是种族成见
You're right, this is racial profiling,

115
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,010
我跟你一样都不喜欢
And I don't like it any more than you do,

116
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:56,040
但霍奇斯明确告诉我
But Hodges told me specifically

117
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,024
他会利用穆斯林激进分子
That he was going to utilize muslim extremists

118
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:00,091
转移人们对这次袭击的责难对象
In an effort to offload the blame for this attack.

119
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:02,014
我得知道他的同党是谁
I need to know who he's working with,

120
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:03,038
我们没时间了
And we're running out of time.

121
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:05,025
我不知道还有什么更好的办法
I don't know a better way of doing this.

122
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,085
如果你有  请现在就告诉我
So if you do, please tell me now.

123
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,042
没有
No.

124
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:14,069
好吧  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

125
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:21,073
克罗伊  请你追查那个列表中的
Chloe, I need you to run down the list of...

126
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:28,050
抱歉
I-I'm sorry,

127
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:29,077
我忘了我要说的话了
I forgot what I was saying.

128
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,007
移民规划局记录  杰克
INS records, jack?

129
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:34,061
没错  先追查那些记录再逆向追踪
Yeah, run those down first and then work backwards.

130
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:36,068
失陪一下
Excuse me.

131
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:40,025
这是他第二次这样了
This is the second time he's done this.

132
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,098
他总是忘东西  脸色很差
He keeps forgetting things, he looks like hell.

133
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,095
这种情况下  他干得很不错了
He's doing pretty well, considering.

134
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:45,025
这种情况
Considering?

135
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:46,045
什么情况
Considering what?

136
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:48,029
他没告诉你吗
He didn't tell you?

137
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:50,006
告诉我什么
Tell me what?

138
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:51,029
如果杰克有什么问题
If there's something wrong with jack,

139

现在就告诉我
Tell me now.

140
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,030
他病了  克罗伊
He's sick, Chloe.

141
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,093
他感染了阮病毒变体
He was infected with the prion variant.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
怎么感染的
How?

143
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:00,037
他当时想要夺回生化武器罐子
He was trying to recover the bioweapon canisters

144
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,037
其中一个破裂了

145

他暴露在了毒气中

146
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:04,010
我的天哪
Oh, my god.

147
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:06,053
抱歉  克罗伊  他可能不想让你担心
I'm sorry, Chloe, he probably didn't want you to worry.

148
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:07,080
克罗伊
Chloe...

149
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,073
你为什么不告诉我你病了
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?

150
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,063
这不要紧
It doesn't matter.

151
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,040
不要紧
It doesn't matter?

152
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,047
我是你朋友
I'm your friend.

153
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:33,070
我们得专心找托尼
We need to stay focused on finding Tony.

154
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,034
杰克  你应该去医院
Jack, you should be in the hospital.

155
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:42,041
这病无法治疗
There's no treatment for this.

156
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,074
无药可医
There's no cure.

157
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:49,052
你是说你会死
So you're telling me you're dying?

158
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:53,009
是的
Yes.

159
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:56,052
还有多少时间
How long?

160
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,036
一天  或者两天
A day, maybe two.

161
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:18,091
我一直在打抗痉挛的药让自己撑着
I've been taking this anti-seizure medicine to keep me on my feet.

162
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,038
目前都还管用
It's been working so far.

163
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,049
老天
Oh, my god.

164
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,095
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

165
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:33,043
克罗伊  没事的
Chloe, it's all right.

166
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,099
我已经接受了现实
I've accepted it...

167
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:38,030
我也需要你这样做
and I need you to accept it, too.

168
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:45,021
不管还能活多久  我希望能做点事
Whatever time I've got left, I want it to matter.

169
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:51,095
我们得找到托尼  了结此事
We need to find Tony, put an end to this.

170
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:56,098
克罗伊
Chloe.

171
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,056
没有你  我做不到的
I can't do this without you.

172
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:05,066
拜托了  我需要你回去继续工作
Please, I need you to go back to work.

173
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,044
好吧
Okay.

174
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:29,018
我们发动这次袭击是为了
We strike this blow for our brothers and sisters

175
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:33,002
命丧于这个腐朽国家之手的兄弟姐妹
Who have died at the hands of this corrupt nation.

176
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,022
光荣的时刻已经来到
The hour is here,

177
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,082
我们已准备好投身到即将开始的战争
And we are ready for the war that is to come.

178
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,091
我们的战士们会战斗不息
Our fighters will not rest

179
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:43,073
直到美国千疮百孔
Until America lies crippled and dying,

180
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,017
直到街道血流成河
Her streets running with blood,

181
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:48,039
直到人民摇尾乞怜
And her people begging for mercy,

182
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,074
但我们不会怜悯和宽恕
But there will be none...

183
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,081
只有报仇雪恨
Only our vengeance.

184
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:53,024
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem.

185
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,024
怎么了
What is it?

00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:56,031
有条子
Police.

187
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:04,099
关掉电脑  藏起来
Why don't you close down the computer and get out of sight.

188
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,019
把东西拆下来  看着这小的
Take everything down and watch the brother.

189

你得跟我来

190
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:15,033
怎么了
What is happening?

191
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,066
外面有两个警察
There are two police officers outside.

192
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:20,000
我要你去看看他们想干嘛
I want you to find out what they want

193
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:22,014
让他们相信这里平安无事
And convince them that everything's okay in here.

194
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,057
吉布安  别想试着报警
Jibraan... don't try to warn them.

195
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:29,084

199
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:47,056
吉布雷·阿尔扎利安

是吉布安·阿尔扎利安
Jibraan al-zarian.

201
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,030
我们接到你邻居的电话
Uh, we got a call from one of your neighbors.

202
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:53,045
他们说听到你房间里有呼救声

看见了一些陌生人进了房间

那些是我的朋友

207
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:05,061
那呼救声是怎么回事呢
And what about the yelling?

208
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,084
我们有些争论
We got into an argument.

209
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:09,071
他们有点喝高了
They were drinking a little too much.

210
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:10,095
不过没什么事情
Uh, it was nothing.

211
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:14,088
先生  你朋友们现在在哪

217
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:31,087
好吧  从现在开始声音小点就好

干得好  吉布安

我们离开之前得念完这份声明

224
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:06,040
别担心
Don't worry about that.

225
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,050
只要你按我们说的做
You just keep doing as we say,

226
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:09,084
你和你弟弟

227
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:11,094
就会安然无恙  懂吗

而这仅仅是个开始

我们会以崇高和正义之名

反复地进行袭击

00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:39,072
但我得告诉你  要我挖出
But I have to tell you, having me dig up dirt

280
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,039
诺亚·丹尼尔斯的丑闻是一回事
On Noah Daniels is one thing.

281
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,068
但这次就完全不同了
This is a whole different animal.

282
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:45,087
这个我明白  马丁
I'm aware of that, Martin.

283
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:49,049
替我办成此事  我要你好好收拾这恶贼
I want this to happen. I want this person taken care of.

284
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:52,026
是乔纳斯·霍奇斯
It's Jonas Hodges.

285
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:54,025
-斯塔克伍德的那个吗  -是的
- Starkwood? - Yes.

286
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:56,071
你有什么理由要对付他呢
What in god's name do you have against him?

287
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:59,081
我不知道你听到了多少风声
I don't know how much of this will get out,

288
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,019
但霍奇斯是今天发生
But Hodges was behind everything

289
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,051
所有事情的主谋  从飞机的失事
That happened today, from the planes going down

290
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,018
一直到袭击白宫
To the attack on the White House.

291
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,041
-什么  -是真的
- What? - It's true.

292
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,067
他还该为我弟弟的死负责
He's also responsible for the death of my brother.

293
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,083
我以为你弟弟是自杀的
I thought your brother killed himself.

294
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,024
他是被谋杀的
He was murdered,

295
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:17,029
是霍奇斯亲手策划的
And Hodges was responsible.

296
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,053
好吧  但是为什么呢
Okay. But why?

297
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:21,007
一言难尽啊  马丁
It's complicated, Martin,

298
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,070
我没有时间详细解释
And I don't have time to go into it.

299
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,078
你要知道的就是霍奇斯拿到了协议
All you need to know is Hodges worked a deal.

300
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:25,089
证人保护协议
Witness protection.

301
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,041
我母亲批准了  然后他就会逍遥法外
My mother approved it, and he's going free...

302
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,093
除非有人出面干涉
Unless someone intervenes.

303
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:33,064
-我能给你提点建议吗  -什么
- Okay, can I give you a little advice? - What?

304
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:35,039
这次玩大了  还是少管闲事为妙
This is big game. Walk away.

305
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:37,015
我做不到
I can't do that.

306
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:38,011
这一旦成为事实
Once this happens,

307
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:40,035
一旦你成功了  你将无法回头
Once it goes through, you can never go back.

308
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,075
这事会在你后半生中如影随形
You will live with it for the rest of your life.

309
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,033
我不用你来给我做良知问题的说教
I don't need a lecture on conscience from you,

310
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,068
不用你们所有人来教我
Of all people.

311
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,081
我已经过了深思熟虑
I have thought this through.

312
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,002
我所不能忍受的是
What I can't live with

313
00:15:58,002 --> 00:16:00,028
那个恶魔逍遥法外
Is that monster getting away with this.

314
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:02,092
他要为他的所作所为付出代价
He has to pay for what he did.

315
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:12,028
那么霍奇斯现在在哪
So, uh, where's Hodges now?

316
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:15,068
在联邦调查局的监狱里  市中心总局
In FBI custody, downtown Bureau.

317
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,009
那协议已经签署了
Deal has been signed.

318
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:19,082
他会在1小时之内释放
He's being released into witness protection

319
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:21,050
并转入证人保护程序
Within the hour.

320
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,043
这是他的行程表
Here's his itinerary.

321
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:28,000
当他走出那扇门时我们就再难对付他了
When he walks out that door, we lose him.

322
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:29,050
他会从此人间蒸发
He disappears forever.

323
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:31,063
一切要速战速决
This has got to happen fast.

324
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,064
马丁
Martin.

325
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,024
好吧
All right.

326
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:44,068
我去打电话
I'll make a call.

327
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:47,082
我会给你联系方式  价钱
I'll get you contact information, a price,

328
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:50,059
还有你如何转账的说明
And instructions on how to transfer the funds.

329
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:53,015
谢谢
Thank you.

330
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,032
我会很快答复你的
You'll hear from me soon.

331
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:22,028
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges,

332
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:24,095
这是美国沙利文警官
This is U.S. Marshal Sullivan.

333
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,055
我正将你转移到他的监管下
I'm placing you in his custody.

334
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:29,066
他会将你转到证人保护组
He'll take you to witness protection.

335
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:34,086
谢谢你的热情款待  女士
Thank you for your hospitality, young lady.

336
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:40,080
这文件概述了你的新身份
This dossier outlines your new identity,

337
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:42,034
你的新住所

338
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,081
你需要改头换面的所有信息
All the information you're going to need to make this transition.

339
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:51,081
罗伯特·蒂皮特吗  我的新名字吗
Robert Tippett? That's my new name?

340
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:53,062
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

341
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,045
听起来像狗狗的名字
Sounds like a dog breed.

342
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:03,042
我们第一站是在科罗拉多州证人保护机构
Our first stop is the Witt-Sec facility in Colorado.

343
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,006
我们会完成您的新档案的最后一步
We'll put the finishing touches on your new biography,

344
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:08,016
制作你的新身份证明
Fabricate your new ID,

345
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:10,000
让你去做心理咨询
Get you into counseling.

346
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,070
心理咨询
Counseling?

347
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:16,027
那有助于您应付新环境中的问题
It helps entrants deal with their new circumstances.

348
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:17,084
孩子  你知道我是谁吗
Son, you know who I am.

349
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:20,021
我给你的印象像一个需要心理治疗
Do I impress you as someone who needs therapy

350
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:21,081
才能应付新环境的人吗
To cope with new circumstances?

351
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:25,001
如果您需要  就能有这项服务  先生
The service is available if you want it, sir,

352
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:27,005
这是对美国纳税人的尊重
Courtesy of the American taxpayer.

353
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:29,095
你以为我被从轻发落了  是吗
You think I'm getting off easy, don't you?

354
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:32,089
我没有任何想法
I don't think anything.

355
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:37,019
我是你肚里的蛔虫  孩子
I can smell attitude, son,

356
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:41,020
你肚里有几根花花肠子清楚得很
And you're giving it off pretty thick.

357
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,043
我已经一无所有
I've lost everything--

358
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,000
我的公司  我的家庭
My company, my family,

359
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,094
最重要的是我的姓名
And most importantly, my name.

360
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,034
你明白要花多少血汗
Do you know how much blood and sweat went

361
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,037
才能使那名字永垂青史吗
Into making that name mean something?

362
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:59,051
我们在30分钟后前往安德鲁斯空军基地
We leave for Andrews Air Force base in 30 minutes.

363
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:02,002
我想你该做好准备
I suggest you get ready.

364
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,068
杰克
Jack?

365
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:39,096
我没事
I'm fine.

366
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,068
你干嘛  我们甚至不知道他们干了什么
What are you doing? We don't even know that they've done anything yet.

367
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:46,044
他们可能是无辜的
They could be innocent.

368
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:47,099
无辜的  你听到霍奇斯说的
Innocent? You heard Hodges.

369
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,021
他们会利用本土恐怖分子来进行这些袭击
They're gonna use sleeper cells to carry out these attacks.

370
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:52,006
阿尔扎利安可能不是今天发生
Al-zarian might not have been knowingly complicit

371
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,050
一切的蓄意同谋者
About everything that happened today,

372
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:55,053
但要说无辜的话  不可能
But innocent? No.

373
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,001
是谁
Yes?

374
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:03,074
我是联邦调查局的沃克探员
This is agent Walker with FBI.

375
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:05,008
高哈先生
Mr. Gohar?

376
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:06,096
是的
Yes.

377
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:08,035
很抱歉这么晚打扰您
We're sorry to bother you at such a late hour,

378
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,098
但我们需要你的协助
But we need your help.

379
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,035
我的协助
My help?

380
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,038
阻止一起潜在的恐怖袭击
To stop a potential terrorist attack.

381
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:20,039
高哈先生
Mr. Gohar?

382
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:24,051
我认识你
I know you.

383
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:27,074
我叫杰克·鲍尔
My name is jack bauer.

384
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:30,005
当然
Of course.

385
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:33,053
我在电视上看到你出庭作证了
I watched your testimony on television.

386
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:35,092
先生 我们能进去说话吗
Sir. Can we talk to you inside?

387
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,099
劳驾
Please.

388
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,098
你们想干嘛
What do you want?

389
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:07,062
我们在找一个在这里朝拜的人
We're looking for a man who worships here.

390
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,079
我们怀疑他可能
We believe he may be

391
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:10,039
在协助进行另一起恐怖袭击
Helping to plan another attack

392
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:12,016
而且很快会在特区发生
That may be happening soon, in D.C.

393
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,089
我知道这种指责最终会落到我们头上
I knew the blame would eventually fall on us.

394
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:17,039
他叫吉布安·阿尔扎利安
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.

395
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,060
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

396
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:21,043
你们为什么怀疑他是恐怖分子呢
And why do you think he's a terrorist?

397
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,099
他符合一些犯罪特征的剖析
He fits a specific profile.

398
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,077
你是说他是穆斯林
You mean, he is a muslim.

399
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:26,007
他是巴基斯坦人
He's a pakistani national.

400
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:27,091
他签证一年前过期
His visa lapsed a year ago.

401
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:29,064
他没有合法住址
And he has no legal address.

402
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,058
他在移民表格中填的担保人是你
He listed you as a personal reference on his INS form.

403
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:35,035
在哪里做礼拜是个人隐私  受法律保护
Where someone worships is private information, protected by law.

404
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,055
目前为止  找到阿尔扎利安
Right now, finding al-zarian

405
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,002
是阻止恐怖袭击的唯一方式
Is the only way we're going to prevent an attack against civilians.

406
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,055
那么  我再问你一遍  你认识他吗
So, I ask you again, sir, do you know him?

407
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:45,062
看照片
Look at the photo!

408
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:52,063
是的  我认识他
Yes, I know him.

409
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,060
但他不是恐怖分子
But he is not a terrorist!

410
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,030
你凭什么这么肯定
What makes you so sure?

411
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:59,071
吉布安向我讨教精神层面的问题很多次了
Jibraan has come to me many times for spiritual advice.

412
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:01,027
我了解这个人
I know the man.

413
00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:04,041
他并不暴力  也不是极端分子
He is not violent and he is not an extremist.

414
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:06,044
可我们有证据表明他是
We have evidence that indicates otherwise.

415
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,088
我倒想看看你们所谓的证据
I would like to see this evidence.

416
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:09,008
听着
Listen to me.

417
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:10,065
我们来不是要和你争论这个问题
We did not come here to debate this with you.

418
00:22:10,072 --> 00:22:11,098
他住在哪里
Where does he live?

419
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:13,042
我不知道他住哪里
I don't know where he lives.

420
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,009
-他在哪里上班  -我也不清楚
- Where does he work? - I don't know that, either.

421
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,025
鬼才会相信你
And I don't believe you!

422
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:17,092
那么我该相信你吗
But you expect me to believe you?

423
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,099
我看了你在参议院的听证会
I watched your hearing at the senate,

424
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,059
我知道你做过什么
I know what you have done.

425
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:24,063
所以你告诉我我为什么要相信你说的一切
So, tell me why should I believe anything you say to me?

426
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,013
首先  你别无选择
First because you don't have a choice.

427
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,007
其次  我告诉你的都是事实
Second, because I am telling you the truth!

428
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,084
事实就是你带着莫须有的消息
The truth is that you come into a house of worship

429
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,084
闯入我的礼拜堂
With information you should not have,

430
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:35,032
肆无忌惮的指控  没有合法文件  
An outrageous accusation, no legal warrant,

431
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:36,078
还威胁我
and threaten me.

432
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:38,098
我没有威胁你
I have not threatened you.

433
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,025
暂时还没
Not yet.

434
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:42,031
但我们都知道接下来会发生什么
But we both know where this is going.

435
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:43,068
如果你这么确定他是清白的
If you're so sure he's innocent,

436
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:46,022
-为什么不敢说他在哪里呢  -杰克
- Why are you afraid to tell us where he is? - Jack...

437
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,022
他在哪里
Where is he?!

438
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:49,009
我说过了  我不知道
I told you, I don't know.

439
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:53,036
即便我知道  我也不会说
But even if i did, I would say nothing.

440
00:22:53,043 --> 00:22:56,009
我不会帮助你们逮捕无辜的人
I would not help you arrest an innocent man.

441
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:00,030
我是沃克探员
This is agent Walker.

442
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:01,053
我是詹尼斯
It's Janis.

443
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,084
一名首府警察15分钟前
A DCPD officer recognized Jibraan Al-zarian

444
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,024
接到一通报告家庭暴力的电话
From a domestic disturbance call

445
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,007
里面涉及吉布安·阿尔扎利安
He took 15 minutes ago.

446
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:08,097
地址是东布鲁克街2700号
The address is 2700 eastbrook,

447
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,038
3号公寓
Apartment 3.

448
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:12,001
很好  继续和首府警局协作
All right, good. Coordinate with DCPD.

449
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:13,065
设置包围圈  监控整幢大楼
Set up an envelope and put the building under surveillance

450
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:14,091
我们10分钟后到
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

451
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:16,065
我们有阿尔扎利安的地址了
We have an address on Al-zarian.

452
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:17,082
-杰克  我们走  -转过身去
- Let's go, Jack. - Turn around.

453
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:19,038
-为什么  -我让你转过去
- Why? - I said turn around.

454
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,055
-举起手来  -杰克
- Put your hands up, now! - Jack?

455
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:22,072
你在做什么  杰克
What are you doing, Jack?

456
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,009
我不会让他在我们到达前
I'm not letting him call Al-zarian

457
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,052
给阿尔扎利安通风报信的
Before we get there.

458
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,003
-他得跟我们一起去  -你没那个权利
- He's coming with us. - You have no right!

459
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:30,010
-我又没干坏事  -闭嘴
- I have done nothing wrong! - Shut up!

460
00:23:31,073 --> 00:23:36,027
我们没有怜悯和宽恕  只有报仇雪恨
...there will be none, only our vengeance.

461
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:39,097
而这仅仅是个开始
And this is only the beginning.

462
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,037
我们会以崇高和正义之名
We will strike again and again

463
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:44,084
发动一次又一次的袭击
In the name of all that is great and righteous.

464
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:48,058
好  好吧
All right, fine.

465
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:51,008
运输队已经准备好  就等我们了
The staging team's ready and waiting on us.

466
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,058
2分钟后就上传好了
This'll be uploaded in two minutes.

467
00:23:53,062 --> 00:23:55,062
很好
Good.

468
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:02,026
吉布安
Jibraan...

469
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,006
准备出发了
We're getting ready to move out.

470
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,037
你得和你弟弟谈一下
I'm gonna need you to talk to your brother.

471
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:10,010
照我们讨论的说给他听
Tell him what we discussed.

472
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,060
去把他叫醒
Go ahead and wake him up.

473
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:15,024
求你了  我不能这么做
Please, I can't do this.

474
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:19,004
不  你能
Yes, you can.

475
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:20,045
你必须做
And you will.

476
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:23,028
我怎么知道你们事后不会杀了哈米德
How do I know you won't kill Hamid anyway?

477
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:26,012
因为我们还需要他告诉警察
Because we need him to tell the police

478
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:27,065
他哥哥是恐怖分子
That his brother's a terrorist.

479
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:30,046
相信我
Believe me,

480
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,042
你这么做是救了他
You're saving his life by doing this.

481
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:34,096
好了  快点  出发了
Now, come on, let's go.

482
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:44,024
哈米德  哈米德  别慌
Hamid, Hamid, calm down.

483
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,077
别怕
Don't be scared.

484
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,051
吉布安  怎么回事
Jibraan, what is this?

485
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:49,014
抱歉以这种方式对你
Sorry we had to do it this way.

486
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,091
可我们不会伤害你的  明白吗
But you're not going to be hurt anymore, okay?

487
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:53,001
我们  我们是谁
We? Who is we?

488
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,025
出什么事了
What's happening?

489
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:55,045
我来解释这一切  好吗
I'll explain everything to you, okay?

490
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,065
他是谁
Who's he?

491
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:01,075
他是我朋友
Um, he's a friend.

492
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,009
你朋友吗  你朋友我都认识
Your friend? I know all your friends.

493
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:04,029
可我从没见过他
I've never seen him before.

494
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,026
那是因为我没把他介绍给你
That's because I have kept him from you.

495
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:08,033
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

496
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,026
我得告诉你一些事情
I have to tell you something.

497
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:14,047
我其实不是你想的那样
I'm not the person you think I am.

498
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:16,027
什么
What?

499
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:20,004
我憎恨这个国家对我们的人民所做的一切
I hate what this country has done to our people.

500
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,001
我和这些人一起工作
And I'm working with these men.

501
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,064
他们会帮助我
They're going to help me strike back

502
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:26,061
向那些欺侮我们的恶势力发动反击
Against the evil that has been done to us.

503
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,008
反击
Strike back?

504
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:30,072
我不能透露更多的了
I can't say any more than that.

505
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:34,069
我不相信
I don't believe it.

506
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:37,006
这个国家收留我们  让我们安居于此
This country brought us in, gave us a home,

507
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:38,042
这才是你挂在嘴边的话
That's what you always said.

508
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:40,076
是的  但那是个谎言
Yeah, that was a lie.

509
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:44,070
我以前一直没告诉你我内心的愤怒
I have been protecting you from this rage I've always felt inside.

510
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,053
但现在是时候让你知道真相了
But now it is time for you to know the truth.

511
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,084
我们的父母死在美国人手上  哈米德
It was the Americans who killed our parents, Hamid.

512
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,067
我要让他们付出代价
I'm going to make them pay.

513
00:25:52,074 --> 00:25:54,024
你对我哥做了什么
What have you done to my brother?

514
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:56,004
你给他洗脑了吗  这根本就不是我哥
You've poisoned his mind! This isn't my brother!

515
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,031
他们并没对我做什么
They have not done anything to me, okay.

516
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:59,098
重要的是你得明白我说的话
It is very important you accept what I'm saying to you.

517
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,038
你干嘛要告诉我这些
Why are you telling me this?

518
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:06,002
若有人问你我的动机
When they ask you why I did what I did,

519
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:07,072
我希望你能告诉他们
I want you to tell them.

520
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,076
没人会怪你的
Okay, no one will blame you for anything.

521
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:13,023
你并没有做错
You have done nothing wrong.

522
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:19,060
我知道你很难理解这一切
I know this is very difficult for you to understand.

523
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:22,007
但以后你会明白的
But over time, you will see.

524
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,081
我爱你  哈米德
I love you, Hamid.

525
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:42,062
你说今天当一个穆斯林是糟糕的一天
You said today was a bad day to be a muslim.

526
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,056
现在看来  当你弟弟更加糟糕
Well, it's an even worse day to be your brother.

527
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,013
好了  该走了
All right, let's go.

528
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,057
集结待命地区准备好了
Staging area's ready.

529
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:56,000
你留下来处理一下
You stay here and finish up.

530
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,027
知道了
Understood.

531
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,034
吉布安  不要这样做
Jibraan, don't do this.

532
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:02,084
一切就绪了吗
Everything set?

533
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:05,064
他弟弟相信了吗
Yeah, was the brother convinced?

534
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:06,091
还不确定
I'm not sure.

535
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:08,038
即便他不相信
But even if he wasn't,

536
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:10,062
袭击一旦发生  他就会相信的
Once the attack happens, he will be.

537
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:12,068
走吧
Let's go.

538
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,000
喂
Hello?

539
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:39,006
喂
Hello?

540
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:43,060
马丁·克里尔说你在等我电话
Yes, yes, martin collier said you'd be expecting my call.

541
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:44,090
他给了我目标的行程
He gave me the target's itinerary.

542
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,031
我正要去
I'm set to go.

543
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:50,088
好的  那么  条件可以接受了
Good. good, so the terms are acceptable.

544
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:51,038
是的
They are.

545
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,035
我只是需要你转账
I just need you to transfer the funds.

546
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,085
账号多少
What's the account number?

547
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,092
国际银行号码是
International banking code is

548
00:27:57,098 --> 00:28:01,035

Account number 0599072477.

550
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:10,003
资金转账后  我会行动的
After the funds have been transferred, I'll proceed.

551
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,056
我们没必要再联系了
There'll be no need for us to have any further contact.

552
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:14,000
好吧  可是你
All right, but what are you--

553
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:32,048
请进
Yes?

554
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:34,049
打扰一下  泰勒女士
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

555
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:37,032
你父亲要见你

我父亲在这里吗

557
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,076
考虑到可能的生化武器袭击
In light of the potential bioweapon attack,

558
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,046
总统下令让他搬到白宫来以防万一

我还有些事情要处理

告诉他们我马上过去

562

我跟你找的人谈过了
I spoke to the contact,

567
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:39,032
但没有谈成
But I couldn't go through with it.

568
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,099
我决定采取你的建议不管这事了
I decided to take your advice and walk away.

569

请尽快和我联系

Jack, it's Chloe, I found something

572
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:58,067
吉布安·阿尔扎利安的事有些蹊跷
Weird about these hits on Jibraan Al-zarian.

573
00:29:58,074 --> 00:29:59,080
说下去
Go ahead.

574
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,041
我告诉过你他的账户
You know how I said that the two million dollars

575
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:02,074
在6个月内
Was deposited into his account

576
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,004
总共存入了2百万美元
Over a period of six months?

577
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,071
那不对  时间被提前了
Well, that wasn't right. They were backdated.

578
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:07,011
什么意思
What do you mean?

579
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:09,031
一种回溯算法捕捉到了一个差异
One of the trace algorithms caught a discrepancy,

580
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,002
那些钱实际上是在30分钟前存入的
All that money was really just deposited 30 minutes ago.

581
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:13,092
他浏览过的那些极端分子网站呢
What about the extremist websites he was visiting?

582
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:15,099
时间标记也是一样的情况
Same thing with the time stamps.

583
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:18,002
网站访问时间是在30分钟前被修改提前的
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.

584
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:20,003
你完全肯定吗
Are you absolutely positive?

585
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:21,083
看起来是这样
It looks that way.

586
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,030
吉布安很可能是无辜的
Jibraan could be innocent.

587
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:25,050
知道了  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

588
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,087
杰克  什么事
What's going on, Jack?

589
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:30,020
克罗伊找到证据表明吉布安是被陷害的
Chloe found evidence that Jibraan is being set up.

590
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:32,007
被人栽赃了
He's been framed.

591
00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:33,041
阿尔梅达为什么要嫁祸一个无辜的人
Why would Almeida frame an innocent man?

592
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,071
因为一旦袭击不顺利
Because they wouldn't want to risk the attack

593
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:35,087
他们冒不起那个险
Not being carried out properly.

594
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:37,028
我怎么这么笨呢
How could I be so stupid?

595
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:41,065
一个无辜的人更容易掌控
An innocent man is so much easier to control.

596
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:43,032
他们需要的只是一个穆斯林
All they needed was a muslim,

597
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,022
他们可以给他伪造任何背景
They could create whatever background they wanted.

598
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:50,046
把手给我
Give me your hands.

599
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,096
我很吃惊
I am surprised.

600
00:30:54,003 --> 00:30:56,036
为什么  你是对的
Why? You were right.

601
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,050
不是关于吉布安
Not about Jibraan.

602
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,080
就我对当局的经验来看
My experience with the authorities,

603
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:02,006
警方一定会使出浑身解数
The police is that they will go to any lengths

604
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,030
对他们的错误矢口否认
Not to admit they were wrong.

605
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:07,019
即使是以牺牲一个无辜生命为代价
Even at the expense of an Innocent man's life.

606
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:10,044
至少你没有这么做
At least you didn't do that.

607
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:13,098
请明白我原谅你了
Please know that I forgive you.

608
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,098
我不是在祈求你的谅解
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

609
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:20,025
但我希望至少你可以原谅自己
Then i hope you can at least forgive yourself.

610
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:24,046
我早就对此不抱希望了
I gave up on that a long time ago.

611
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:31,053
鲍尔先生  信仰上帝为时不晚啊
It's never to late to turn towards god, Mr. Bauer.

612
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:41,087
-够了吗  -是的  谢谢
- That's enough? - Yeah, thanks.

613
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:43,051
谢谢
Thank you.

614
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:47,005
你不用在这陪着我  艾莉
You don't need to stay with me, Ally.

615
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:49,035
他们需要我的时候会来找我的
But they know where to find me if they need me.

616
00:31:51,048 --> 00:31:54,095
我觉得让你了解当前局势
I thought it was important for you to hear what's going on.

617
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:58,059
还有我这么做的原因是很必要的
And for you to understand why I did what I did.

618
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:00,063
宝贝  你是总统你做主
You're the president, sweetheart.

619
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:03,060
你不需要向我解释
You don't owe me an explanation.

620
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:05,066
宝贝女儿
There's my girl.

621
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:07,073
爸爸
Hi, dad.

622
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:11,084
利维  你可以抱得再紧些
Livy, you can squeeze a bit harder.

623
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,047
我没那么脆弱
I won't break.

624
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:14,054
哦  我不行了
Oh, I might!

625
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:18,044
抱歉我没能及时赶到医院
I'm sorry I couldn't come to the hospital.

626
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:20,028
别傻了
Don't be silly.

627
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:23,062
你是上帝派来助你妈妈一臂之力的天使
You're a godsend being here helping your mom.

628
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:27,049
能看到你们言归于好
Just knowing you two were speaking again,

629
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,052
甚至可以同舟共济  这就足够了
Let alone working together, that's enough.

630
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:32,079
亨利  我不确定我们彼此的信任

她与乔纳斯·霍奇斯所定的协议
About the deal she made with Jonas Hodges.

634
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:46,067
而且我也能理解
And I know you, understandably,

635
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:49,074
你对这一协议的强烈反对
Have serious concerns about that.

636
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:54,048
我想了很久
Well, I've had some time to think.

637

如果我站在妈妈的立场上

这是一个英明的领袖

但是我确能理解

我对自己的鲁莽决定深表歉意

645
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:21,044
总有一天乔纳斯·霍奇斯将面对公正的审判
Jonas Hodges will face judgment one day.

646
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:24,031
即便此生不能  必在来世

647

00:34:04,062 --> 00:34:07,089

我需要将那钱包充公
I'll need to confiscate the wallet.

653

我们不能让您持有任何

我不打算一辈子干这行

很高兴听你这么说

无论是谁下令杀他的

00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,083
一切都好
Oh, it's fine.

695
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,024
我一会就回来
I'll be right back.

696
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,008
喂
Yeah?

697
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:43,011
霍奇斯死了
Hodges is dead!

698
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,051
冷静
Okay, calm down.

699
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:46,005
我们不该在电话里谈论的
We shouldn't be talking on the phone.

700
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:47,072
你不明白
You don't understand,

701
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,028
这里有个致命的失误
There's been a terrible mistake.

702
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:51,055
我跟那个你给我号码的人说过话
I spoke to the man whose number you gave me.

703
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,022
但我扛不起这个失误
But I didn't go through with it.

704
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:54,032
我不能
I couldn't.

705
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,036
难道你没收到我的短信吗
Didn't you get my message?

706
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:56,046
奥利维亚  我叫你冷静
Olivia, I said calm down.

707
00:37:56,053 --> 00:37:57,096
我办不到
I can't!

708
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:00,001
霍奇斯死了  现在我难逃干系了
Hodges is dead and I'm responsible.

709
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:01,086
我们不能在电话里说这些话
We cannot have this conversation over the phone.

710
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:02,096
你明白吗  你有没有意识到
Do you understand? Do you realize

711
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:04,043
如果这些话泄露出去我会有什么下场吗
What could happen to me if this gets out?!

712
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:06,000
奥利维亚  你现在该闭上嘴了
Olivia, you need to stop talking now.

713
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:07,000
听到我说了吗
Do you hear me?

714
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:08,080
深呼吸  听我说
Take a deep breath, listen to me.

715
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:10,007
我们挂掉电话  好吗
All right, we'll hang up, okay?

716
00:38:10,014 --> 00:38:11,024
好的
All right.

717
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:12,031
好的  我在听
Okay, I'm listening.

718
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:13,058
好的
Okay.

719
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:15,024
你能去珀欣公园吗
Can you get to Pershing Park?

720
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:16,051
不行  现在不行
No, not right now.

721
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:18,015
我正在和我母亲开会
I'm in a meeting with my mother.

722
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:20,032
好吧  我会等的  你尽快赶到那里
Fine. I'll wait. Get there as fast as you can.

723
00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:22,065
然后我们当面谈
We'll talk about this face-to-face.

724
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:23,089
好吗
Okay?

725
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:24,086
好吧
All right.

726
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,031
谢谢你  亚伦
Thank you, Aaron.

727
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:08,030
什么情况  探员
What do you have, agent?

728
00:39:08,036 --> 00:39:10,047
武装分子在里屋  持有一名人质
Armed hostile in the back room, holding a hostage.

729
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:11,053
有阿尔梅达的消息吗
What about Almeida?

730
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,063
他不在里面
He's not in there.

731
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,024
自己看吧  里德
See for yourself. Reed,

732
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,000
-给我们换个视角  -遵命  长官
- Give us another look. - Yes, sir.

733
00:39:19,081 --> 00:39:21,061
镜头向人质方向拉近
Move in closer on the hostage.

734
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:24,075
那是你们要找的人吗
Is that who you're looking for?

735
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:26,008
不是
No.

736
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:28,025
那是吉布安的弟弟  哈米德
That's Jibraan's brother, Hamid.

737
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,079
他们以他来要挟  要求吉布安
They're using him as leverage, to make Jibraan

738
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:31,099
听他们的话
Do what they want.

739
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:34,001
因为若是我也会这么干
'cause that's what I would've done.

740
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:36,046
探员  一定要确保人质安全
Agent, it is imperative that we take this hostile alive.

741
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:38,016
现在  他是我们找到
Right now, he's our only shot at finding out

742
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,046
袭击地点的唯一希望
Where this attack is going taking place.

743
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:41,000
明白  我已经通知了我的手下
Understood. I've already informed my men.

744
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,030
我希望亲自行动  可以吗
I want to run point on this. Is that all right?

745
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:45,013
谢谢
Thanks.

746
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,033
你要留在这里
You're going to stay here

747
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,010
和后备队员一起
With the backup teams.

748
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:49,077
你觉得这是个好主意吗
Are you sure that's such a good idea?

749
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:51,077
怎么了
What?

750
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:54,014
鲍尔探员  他看起来不太好
Agent Bauer-- he doesn't seem to be too well.

751
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:56,098
-也许该你来指挥  -我正在指挥
- Maybe you should be in charge. - I am.

752
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:01,085
杰克被生化武器感染了
Jack was infected with the bioweapon.

753
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:04,059
就是他们准备用来袭击的那种武器
The same one that they are going to use in this attack.

754
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:05,075
那么他应该留在医院里
Then he should be in the hospital.

755
00:40:05,082 --> 00:40:07,022
没有治疗方法的
There is no treatment.

756
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,016
他可能没有一天的命可活
He probably has less than a day to live.

757
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:10,092
如果他足够坚强的话  相信我
So if he is strong enough, trust me,

758
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:12,099
他是做这个的最佳人选
He's the best person for this job.

759
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:14,016
抱歉
I'm sorry,

760
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:15,050
我开始不知道
I didn't realize.

761
00:40:15,056 --> 00:40:17,050
沃克探员  我们准备好了
Agent Walker, we're ready.

762
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:19,050
鲍尔先生  请你
Please, Mr. Bauer,

763
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:20,084
竭尽全力营救哈米德
Do what you can to save Hamid.

764
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,047
我们检查了窗户
We've checked the windows.

765
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:24,014
我们有个明确的办法
We have a clear approach.

766
00:40:25,017 --> 00:40:29,041
-出发  -探员们和高哈先生呆在一起
- Let's go. - Agents, stay with Mr. Gohar.

767
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:06,015
听我数
On my count.

768
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:09,022
三  二  一
Three... two... one.

769
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:17,073
哈米德  住手
Hamid, stop!

770
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,056
把那放下
Put it down.

771
00:41:19,063 --> 00:41:21,083
我们是联邦调查局  我们需要他活着
We're FBI. We need him alive.

772
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,090
-把那放下  -他害我哥成了恐怖分子
- Put it down. - He made my brother into a terrorist.

773
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:25,050
你哥哥不是恐怖分子  他是无辜的
Your brother is not a terrorist. He's innocent.

774
00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:26,093
我们知道  他是被陷害的
We know that. He's being set up.

775
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,037
-他是被逼的  -什么
- He's being forced to do this. Please. - What?

776
00:41:29,044 --> 00:41:30,071
那个人是唯一能
The only one who can tell us

777
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:32,091
告诉我们你哥哥在哪的人
Where your brother is that man right there.

778
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:34,098
现在把那放下
Now put it down.

779
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,088
站起来  把手放在脑后
Stand up now, put your hands behind your head.

780
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,058
快点
Do it!

781
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:42,098
沃克探员  快去
Agent Walker, move in now.

782
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:43,098
快走  坐在床上
Move! On the bed

783
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:50,073
见鬼  他失血过多  需要医生  快
Damn it, he's bleeding out. We need a medic, now!

784
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,059
现场需要医护队
We need a med team on site.

785
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:25,036
坐在那儿
Sit right there.

786
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,003
你进入了系统吗
Are you in their system?

787
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,007
我已经进入了主要安全线路了
I've tapped into the main security trunk line,

788
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:33,080
但我仍在迂回破解  确保
But I'm still looping in breakers to make sure

789
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,030
我们的进入不被标记上
The tap doesn't get flagged.

790
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:37,044
好吧  我们现在有时间表限制
All right, well, we're on a timetable here.

791
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:39,014
还需要多长时间
How much longer is it going to take?

792
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:41,001
10分钟  也许15分钟
Ten, maybe 15 minutes.

793
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,018
把那包给我
Hand me that case.

794
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:47,011
你们要我做什么
What are you going to have me do?

795
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:49,062
你马上就会知道的
You'll find out soon enough.

796
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,096
地铁准时吗
Is the subway on schedule?

797
00:43:00,003 --> 00:43:01,083
是的  准时
Yeah, it's on schedule.
