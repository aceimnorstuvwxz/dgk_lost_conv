1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,740
What's going on?

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,260
What do you mean?

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,940
I'm your brother.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,760
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,060
It's all right, really.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,310
Okay.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,580
One more chapter and we'll take a break.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,870
David !

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,750
Get help!

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,840
Whoever did this, I want them dead or in custody

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,330
by the time the Russians get here.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,690
I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty, Sir.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,520
No.

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,910
Absolutely not.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,170
I think...

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,550
that David was killed because of

17
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,500
something he was about to tell me.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,910
He said that it concerned national security

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,120
and that it involved you.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,230
Was she all right?

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,150
No, Walt, she's not all right.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,850
She's having another one of her delusions.

23
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,070
What is this, an interrogation?

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,470
I just don't like being lied to.

25
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,480
No one's lying to you, Derek.

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,460
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,340
Sorry.

28
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,360
You don't owe me an explanation.

29
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,300
If you had wanted to tell me about your past

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,910
you would have told me already.

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,200
Yeah?

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,140
Jack, I know this isn't protocol,

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,790
please don't hang up on me, I need your help.

34
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,090
They got Tony and Michelle,

35
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,960
Michelle is dead, Tony's in critical condition,

36
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,900
now they're gonna kill me.

37
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,870
What the hell are you doing here?

38
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,110
I'm sorry I followed you, I'm just...

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,610
I'm just worried about my mother.

40
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,690
You're going with me.

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,830
Hold your fire, Chloe!

42
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,710
Palmer was the primary target.

43
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,160
Set you up. Make it looks like you did it.

44
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,720
You're the one that killed Palmer.

45
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:51,860
Yeah.

46
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,170
The following takes place between 8Am and 9Am.

47
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,570
The President's retreat is still vulnerable.

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,870
You need to post 2 more people here at Delta.

49
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,370
It's a high probability point of infiltration.

50
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,470
We'll have to pull assets from somewhere else.

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,330
Yeah, Marcie, hi.

52
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,270
Can you give me the figures?

53
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,930
Excuse me, Sir. Sorry to interrupt.

54
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,830
What is it, Edgar?

55
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,070
We have a visual on a suspect, I thought you might want to know.

56
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,070
He may be the Palmer shooter.

57
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,530
Were you able to make an ID?

58
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,370
I think you should see for yourself.

59
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,570
About an hour before President Palmer was shot...

60
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,070
someone broke into the service entrance of the building across the street,

61
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,230
the one the sniper used.

62
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,670
We have a frame grab from a security video.

63
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,030
I ran it through a high-res filter,

64
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,070
so it may take a few seconds to render.

65
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,970
Audrey.

66
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,770
What is going on here, Jack?

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,330
They're setting me up to take the fall

68
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,870
for Palmer's assassination.

69
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,730
Palmer's not even president anymore.

70
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,570
Why would they want him dead?

71
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,870
I don't know.

72
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,670
You need to get as far away from here as you can.

73
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,630
Just disappear.

74
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,970
No, what I need to do is to find out who really killed President Palmer.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,670
How are you gonna do that?

76
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,970
Start at the beginning.

77
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,830
Investigate the original crime scene.

78
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,570
David Palmer was visiting his brother when he was shot.

79
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,370
Maybe he left something there that can help me.

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,030
That's crazy.

81
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,830
Palmer was assassinated an hour ago.

82
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,370
The place is gonna be crawling with Secret Service,

83
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,830
FBI, local police.

84
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,270
I need access to a building schematic

85
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,070
and an interagency deployment grid.

86
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,870
Can you get that for me or not?

87
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,930
Yeah.

88
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,370
I should be able to log on remotely from the site.

89
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,270
Okay. Come on,

90
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,870
let's go.

91
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,470
How could you kill that guy?

92
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,050
I'm sorry you had to see that

93
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,190
Derek. Get in the van.

94
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,970
I'm not going anywhere with you.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,830
You're gonna do exactly what I tell you

96
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,670
until I pass you off to your mother.

97
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,970
Let go of me.

98
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,470
Let's get something straight, kid.

99
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,020
The only reason you're still conscious is because

100
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,770
I don't want to carry you.

101
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,670
Now get in the van.

102
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,270
Preliminary analysis indicates the video hasn't been doctored.

103
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,370
Then Jack was in the building the sniper fired from

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,570
at the same time President Palmer was assassinated.

105
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,230
That's impossible.

106
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,230
This whole thing is impossible.

107
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,170
Bill, you were there when Jack was shot.

108
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,540
He had not pulse, no vitals.

109
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,170
And I have no idea how Jack staged his own death.

110
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,730
But I understand his reasons.

111
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,470
He was about to be handed over to the Chinese government

112
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,130
to spend the rest of his life in prison.

113
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,020
None of that explains why Jack would want to kill David Palmer.

114
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,670
I had Curtis pull the phone logs.

115
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,530
Palmer, Tony and Michelle were all talking to Jack

116
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,270
right before he was supposedly killed.

117
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,420
Our working theory is that

118
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,370
they conspired to help Jack fake his own death.

119
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,820
Now you're saying that Jack was behind the attack

120
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,580
on Tony and Michelle, too?

121
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,070
Why would Jack want to kill the people who helped him?

122
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,720
Something may have happened and he stopped

123
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,270
trusting them to keep his secret.

124
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,170
Jack would never murder his friends.

125
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,570
Audrey...

126
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,870
I don't want to believe Jack did this, either.

127
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,000
But right now,

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,830
it's the best explanation

129
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,770
for the evidence that we have.

130
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,970
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,230
The White House needs to know about this.

132
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,470
Yeah, I'll call the President.

133
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,130
Bill.

134
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,670
What is it, Curtis?

135
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,620
I had Adamson run a data recovery operation

136
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,370
on Tony's phone records.

137
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,470
They show Chloe was on those calls

138
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,530
with President Palmer and Tony.

139
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,570
Chloe knew Jack was alive?

140
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,710
Apparently.

141
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,070
We called her in an hour ago, she should have been here by now.

142
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,730
I've been trying to call her on her cell but she's not answering.

143
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,720
I wanted to run a locate but Spencer talked me out of it.

144
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,970
- If anything happens to her... - Stop !

145
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,370
Have Adamson track her cell,

146
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,970
we need to get to her before Jack does.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,930
Put out an interagency alert.

148
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,520
Jack Bauer is now the prime suspect

149
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,010
in President Palmer's assassination.

150
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,890
Emphasize that he's a former agent,

151
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,080
well-trained and should be considered extremely dangerous.

152
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,370
Excuse me, Sir.

153
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,030
What is it Walt ?

154
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,270
Mrs. Logan called again.

155
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,270
I can't keep putting her off

156
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,470
about this phone call with David Palmer.

157
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,170
Why would David Palmer call my wife

158
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,770
about a national security threat?

159
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,060
That's what she says he wanted to talk to her about.

160
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,230
A matter of national security.

161
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,170
Maybe if I investigated the phone call?

162
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,030
No, you need to stay focused on the Summit.

163
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,770
I am, Sir, which is why we can't risk having

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,970
Mrs. Logan obsess about this phone call.

165
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,030
Showing her the truth might help her

166
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,270
get on with her responsibilities today.

167
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,470
So what are you... what are you suggesting?

168
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,070
Well, if David Palmer called her yesterday,

169
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,390
our communications office will have a recording of their conversation.

170
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,070
Get that for me.

171
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,570
Yes, Sir.

172
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,870
And Walt...

173
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,570
thank you for doing this.

174
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,670
Mr. President, Audrey Raines is holding on line 3.

175
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,570
Ms. Raines, this is President Logan.

176
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,230
You're also on with Walt Cummings.

177
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,120
Sir, CTU has a suspect in the

178
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,970
assassination of President Palmer.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,370
Good!

180
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,070
Who is it?

181
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,370
Ms. Raines?

182
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,870
It's Jack Bauer, Sir.

183
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,810
Jack Bauer's dead.

184
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,570
We've all been living under that assumption, Sir.

185
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,430
I don't understand.

186
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,270
What makes you think it's Bauer?

187
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,430
CTU has verified surveillance video

188
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,070
placing Jack Bauer at the same time,

189
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,330
in the same building as the

190
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,470
sniper who killed President Palmer.

191
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,570
Audrey, this is Walt Cummings.

192
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,430
Let me get clear on this.

193
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,830
Are you saying that Bauer shot David Palmer?

194
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,970
We're proceeding under that assumption, yes.

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,670
Why? For what possible reason?

196
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,030
David Palmer might have known that

197
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,330
Jack Bauer was alive,

198
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,620
knowledge that he shared with three other CTU agents,

199
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,870
all of whom have been targeted in the last hour.

200
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,270
The man does have a history of insubordination,

201
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,230
irrational behavior, drug addiction.

202
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,170
Jack Bauer has a history of great service to this country.

203
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,130
How does this affect your threat assessment for the Summit?

204
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,470
We're still recommending that you delay or reschedule

205
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,040
until Jack Bauer's apprehended.

206
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,130
Ms. Raines, you have a suspect. Find him.

207
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,570
Yes, Sir.

208
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,570
Sir, President Suvarov arrives within the hour.

209
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,070
Should we think about informing his security chief

210
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,270
that he's a potential target?

211
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,630
No. No.

212
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,030
I want this information limited to those involved

213
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,730
in the manhunt for Jack Bauer. Understood?

214
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,270
Yes, Sir.

215
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,370
I found Haas.

216
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,470
He and his men are all dead.

217
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,830
How did this happen?

218
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,130
I'm not sure.

219
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,370
The last time I spoke to Haas

220
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,080
he was about to move on Bauer and the woman.

221
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,770
Is there any sign of Bauer now?

222
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,730
No.

223
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,920
I'll dispatch a team and track him.

224
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,400
We'll have him in 24 hours.

225
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,130
No, let CTU find Bauer.

226
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,770
Once they have him in custody, we'll take him out.

227
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,370
You're not concerned Bauer will impede the operation?

228
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,070
He won't have chance.

229
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,870
We launch in less than an hour.

230
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,880
All of their hardware's military spec.

231
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,670
Fragmentation grenades, percussion grenades...

232
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,470
Here's a comm unit we can use.

233
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,270
Who are these people?

234
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,230
Yeah?

235
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,330
Frank, will you please tell me what's going on?

236
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,670
Diane, I know it's hard, but please try not to worry.

237
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,730
Derek is fine.

238
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,730
Where are you now?

239
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,070
I'm about a half hour outside of L.A.

240
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,330
Just tell me where to meet you.

241
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,620
I don't know yet.

242
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,830
Just keep heading towards the city.

243
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,420
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

244
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,970
Can I talk to him?

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,870
Of course, yeah.

246
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,370
It's your mother. Talk to her.

247
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,830
Mom?

248
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,470
Derek, are you okay?

249
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,370
Yeah, I'm all right.

250
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,230
Are you sure?

251
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,870
Jack, we're about a block away.

252
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,470
Say good-bye to your mother.

253
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,680
I have to hang up now, Mom.

254
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,390
Don't worry I am fine.

255
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,070
Derek, I love you.

256
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,470
Me, too.

257
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,320
Give me the phone.

258
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,760
Get to the back of the vehicle.

259
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,170
Go!

260
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,870
While security agencies are remaining hushed,

261
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,770
speculation begins to grow.

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,430
We're told, though, that that speculation

263
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,570
will not be addressed

264
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,670
because the government says security right now

265
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,930
is of utmost importance.

266
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,130
Now, look behind me,

267
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,070
you'll see the Los Angeles apartment building

268
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,430
where President David Palmer was assassinated

269
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,940
a little more than an hour ago.

270
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,010
You can also see Americans

271
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,810
of all ages have started to gather

272
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,720
to mourn and pay their last respects

273
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,640
to the beloved former president,

274
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,370
All right, go on through.

275
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,000
Let her through.

276
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,070
We're clear.

277
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,670
Come on up front.

278
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,370
Hold the light on the bag.

279
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,330
Can you get a wireless access point from down here?

280
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,170
Yeah, I'm reading the agents' transponders.

281
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,770
I can track their locations to within three feet.

282
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,930
Jack! There are 167 agents in and around the location,

283
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,470
25 of them in Wayne Palmer's apartment alone.

284
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,530
I know...

285
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,480
that's why we better hope that this is gonna be

286
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,400
the last place they're gonna be looking for me.

287
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,470
Testing 1, 2, testing 1, 2, 3.

288
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,730
Okay.

289
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,430
This is field ops communication unit.

290
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,470
All you need to do is put it in your ear and we're set to go.

291
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,770
Derek, put out the light.

292
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,120
Officer.

293
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,470
All right, let me check that.

294
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,170
What...

295
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,930
Relax.

296
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,670
He's really good at this.

297
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,070
You sure he's okay?

298
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,970
Yeah.

299
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,670
I think.

300
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,870
Chloe, do you copy?

301
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,170
Yeah.

302
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,070
Wayne Palmer's apartment is the penthouse.

303
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,370
Going up now.

304
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,970
Jack, there are four agents waiting at the lobby.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,870
Hold off on going up if you can.

306
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,070
Too late.

307
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,870
I'm entering the apartment.

308
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,530
Most of the agents are in the living room.

309
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,470
That must be where Palmer was shot.

310
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,830
There are two rooms to the north,

311
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,770
15 feet probably bedrooms...

312
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,670
they're clear, no agents.

313
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,570
This first room is a study.

314
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,170
Let me know if anyone comes this way.

315
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,670
Will do, Jack.

316
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,970
You keep calling him Jack.

317
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,770
He told my mother and I his name's Frank.

318
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,570
Who is he, really?

319
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,730
His name's Jack Bauer.

320
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,020
Up until a year and a half ago

321
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,270
he worked for the government.

322
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,430
Is that why we're in the building

323
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,070
where the president was killed?

324
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,470
Please don't ask me any more questions.

325
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,270
Can't you at least tell me

326
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,370
why he had to pretend he was someone else?

327
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,120
Certain people thought the best way to cover up their mistakes

328
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,270
was to get rid of Jack.

329
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,370
You mean, kill him?

330
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,830
Yes.

331
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,870
Jack had to give up everything and everyone in his life,

332
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,770
including his daughter.

333
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,770
He has a daughter?

334
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,170
I've already told you more than I should.

335
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,970
I have the computer in the study booted up.

336
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,680
President Palmer had a user account.

337
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,370
Is it password-secured?

338
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,330
No.

339
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,170
There are about a dozen files.

340
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,330
Only one of them's encrypted.

341
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,430
That's where I'm gonna look.

342
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,420
Okay, give me the computer's IP address.

343
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,370
I'll upload a decryption program to it.

344
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,530
Hold on.

345
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:44,870
292.162.12.2

346
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,630
Someone's at the door.

347
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,170
Not according to the deployment grid.

348
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,470
There are no agents there.

349
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,120
Do not move. Do not raise your voice.

350
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,660
You son of a bitch.

351
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,130
You killed my brother.

352
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,730
Mr. Palmer, you know I didn't do that.

353
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,180
Whatever evidence they showed you

354
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,590
against me has been fabricated.

355
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,400
I served your brother for years.

356
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,770
I would've gladly given my life for his.

357
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,170
He was my friend.

358
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,970
The only reason that I am here,

359
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,070
is to try and figure out why and how he was assassinated.

360
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,230
I was hoping to find clues on that computer.

361
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,920
Why don't you step into the next room, Jack,

362
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,570
and ask the Secret Service to help you find it?

363
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,730
Because I'm being set up.

364
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,670
Whoever's behind this has planted evidence against me

365
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,230
making me the shooter.

366
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,870
It would be useless to try and convince the authorities otherwise.

367
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,530
You think you're gonna convince me?

368
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,770
If I killed your brother,

369
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,930
why didn't I kill you

370
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,970
when you walked through the door?

371
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,130
Think about this, Wayne.

372
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,870
Why would I be here?

373
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,470
Please... I need your help.

374
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,820
Jack, how do you expect me to

375
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,470
believe you under these circumstances?

376
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,830
Take the gun.

377
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,070
Jack, what are you doing?

378
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,170
Take the gun.

379
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,720
...that after two terms in the House

380
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,330
and one in the Senate,

381
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,470
David Palmer was elected president with a 60% plurality.

382
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,130
There you are, Mrs. Logan.

383
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,070
David and I first got to know each other

384
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,870
when he was elected to Congress.

385
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,130
He and Charles never saw eye to eye politically, but...

386
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,970
David never let that get in the way of our friendship.

387
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,570
Oh... that picture's from his inauguration.

388
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,060
At the ball

389
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,850
I was one of the first people David asked to dance.

390
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,070
Mrs. Logan... I need a few more minutes with your hair...

391
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,770
I know! I can do it myself.

392
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,440
Just trying to help.

393
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,050
I'm sorry, Evelyn,

394
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,470
I know. I'm sorry.

395
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,670
Mrs. Logan...

396
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,770
May I have a word?

397
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,270
Of course.

398
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,670
The president asked me to look into the call

399
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,180
from David Palmer that you... told him about.

400
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,770
I was beginning to think you were ignoring me.

401
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,470
So when did this call take place?

402
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,580
Last night.

403
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,630
It woke me up.

404
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,020
I had fallen asleep watching the news,

405
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,330
so it was somewhere between 10:00 and 11:00.

406
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,140
Well, I'll have someone pull up the call from the audio archives.

407
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,820
Walt.

408
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,170
He doesn't believe me, does he?

409
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,770
Charles.

410
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,770
He thinks I'm making the whole thing up.

411
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,070
I wouldn't say that, Mrs. Logan.

412
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,570
Well, of course you wouldn't say it.

413
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,330
-Mrs. Logan...

414
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,650
Walt, you can go now.

415
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,370
President David Palmer, dead today at age 55.

416
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,770
Your brother say or do anything

417
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,470
out of the ordinary before he was shot?

418
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,070
He was acting distracted ever since he came to Los Angeles.

419
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,470
I finally called him on it this morning.

420
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,030
What'd he say?

421
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,770
He never had the chance to say anything, Jack.

422
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,770
The decryption program's finished running.

423
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,480
You should be able to open the file.

424
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,170
Okay, I'm going into it now.

425
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,370
That's the first chapter of his memoir.

426
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,130
That doesn't make any sense...

427
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,670
why would he encrypt that?

428
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,370
I mean, there are printouts of it all over the place.

429
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,270
Maybe he hid some information in the document.

430
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,270
We're gonna have to compare this to the printout,

431
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,230
see if he added or changed anything.

432
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,170
Got one right here.

433
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,720
You haven't sent the file allocations.

434
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,170
- What's the problem? - I need a higher level access code.

435
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,170
Look, if you're still upset about me and Chloe...

436
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,330
I don't care about that.

437
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,920
I care that if you hadn't left her on her own this morning,

438
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,630
maybe she'd be okay right now.

439
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,270
Don't you think I know that?

440
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,770
Look, you're just making it harder for me to do my job.

441
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,070
Use Chloe's access code: JJ72.

442
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,870
You won't get fire-walled with it.

443
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,470
Thank you.

444
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,770
Edgar.

445
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,630
What?

446
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,430
This is weird.

447
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,770
I tried logging in under Chloe's access code...

448
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,070
the system says I'm already signed in.

449
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,770
Let me see...

450
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,770
That's because Chloe's logged in, remotely.

451
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,530
Are you sure it's her?

452
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,070
Yes... see the way the traffic's redirected through an external socket?

453
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,670
Even I don't know how to do that.

454
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,870
Then she's alive.

455
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,830
Buchanan.

456
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,070
Sir, it's Edgar. I think we can find Chloe.

457
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,530
How ?

458
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,570
She's accessing our system through a laptop.

459
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,130
I'm running a locate now.

460
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,970
What's she using our system to do?

461
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,530
All I can see from here is she's tracking

462
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,370
Secret Service and FBI deployments.

463
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,870
The locate came back.

464
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,270
She's at Wayne Palmer's building.

465
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,130
The signal's faint.

466
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,420
It's possible she's in the parking garage under the building.

467
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,670
Let me know if she changes location.

468
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,770
Why would Chloe be at the scene of

469
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,370
Palmer's assassination, tracking agents?

470
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,630
She wouldn't be...

471
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,570
unless someone was forcing her.

472
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,630
What do you mean?

473
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,070
Maybe Jack left evidence behind he needs to erase.

474
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,370
Surrounded by all of those agents?

475
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,630
Bill, that doesn't make sense.

476
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,970
Jack can explain it to us when we apprehend him.

477
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,730
This is Bill Buchanan at CTU. I need to speak

478
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,470
to the Secret Service field director immediately.

479
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:24,730
Yes.

480
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,930
Have you left yet?

481
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,470
No, we were delayed.

482
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,630
We're still loading the truck.

483
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,330
You should be on your way by now.

484
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,670
Be there in 20 minutes, as planned.

485
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,470
Call me when you're approaching.

486
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,970
Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop...

487
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,930
Right there

488
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,370
he added something in the middle of a sentence:

489
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,070
a name and an address.

490
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,070
There.

491
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,730
"Chevensky - 16 Transport Way."

492
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,970
Chloe, did you get that? It looks like an address.

493
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,330
Yes.

494
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,620
Transport Way is a street at the Ontario airport.

495
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,830
Okay, I want you to check all inbound flights into Ontario.

496
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,870
Look for a passenger Chevensky. Try and make the connection.

497
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,770
Jack, the Secret Service is changing its deployment.

498
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,970
How?

499
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,570
Suddenly, there are a lot of agents moving into the building.

500
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,230
I'm on my way down.

501
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,770
They know that I'm here.

502
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,970
Let me help you get out of here, Jack.

503
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,030
No.

504
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,130
You can't risk being connected to me.

505
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,630
And until we know who to trust,

506
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,030
you can't tell anybody about what we found, do you understand?

507
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,630
I'm going to do everything I can

508
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,590
to find out who did this to your brother.

509
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,670
I'll be in touch.

510
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,070
Chloe, I need another way out of here.

511
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,470
Checking.

512
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,870
Jack, across the hall, through the kitchen.

513
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,370
One agent at the door.

514
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,970
Copy that.

515
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,230
I'm in the elevator.

516
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,470
Where are they concentrating their agents?

517
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,670
Jack, they cut off access to my grid.

518
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,210
I don't know where the agents are.

519
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,670
They were grouping in the lobby.

520
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,370
I'm getting out on the second floor.

521
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,570
Come on, Jack.

522
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,070
What'd you get for me on Chevensky?

523
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,830
He's not a passenger,

524
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,360
he's a baggage supervisor at the airport.

525
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,360
Jack Bauer! Agent O'Brian!

526
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:40,360
The perimeter is sealed! There is no way out!

527
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,070
Step into view with your hands in the air!

528
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,870
We know you're down here!

529
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,120
Step into view with your hands in the air!

530
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,340
Do not shoot!

531
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,770
We need them alive!

532
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,670
No one fire!

533
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,670
No one fire!

534
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,470
Do not fire!

535
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,870
Step out of the vehicle!

536
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,270
Check the back!

537
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,480
Get the side!

538
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,890
Step to your left!

539
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,400
Get down on your knees!

540
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,870
Cuff her!

541
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,570
Open the back!

542
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,020
Bauer's not here.

543
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,370
Secure the area.

544
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,620
Get in!

545
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,670
Give me my bag!

546
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,870
Got it.

547
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,160
- Frank. - Yeah, it's me.

548
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,570
Listen, Derek is all right.

549
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,970
I just need to know where you are.

550
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,030
I'm on the 210 at the 10.

551
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,470
Okay, I want you to take the 10

552
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,870
East to the Ontario Airport.

553
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,430
When you get there,

554
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,870
I want you to go to the parking lot in front of the terminal.

555
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,690
I'll meet you on the west side of that parking lot.

556
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,670
Do you understand me?

557
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,380
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,970
Diane, listen to me.

559
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,670
I am so sorry that I got you involved in this.

560
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,830
But everything's gonna be all right.

561
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,960
I'll be there in a few minutes, okay?

562
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,870
Okay.

563
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,670
Okay. Thanks.

564
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,970
Mr. Buchanan, this is Agent Jennings.

565
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,430
There's no sign of Jack Bauer yet,

566
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,260
but we've apprehended your agent, Chloe O'Brian.

567
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,370
She was trying to escape our agents

568
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,030
and get away from the building.

569
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,070
You're telling me she wasn't under duress?

570
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,170
Not as far as I can tell.

571
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,570
Put her on the phone.

572
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,610
Uncuff her.

573
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,200
Bill Buchanan wants to talk to you.

574
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,730
Hi.

575
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,370
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

576
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,380
Jack didn't kill anybody.

577
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,940
He's being framed to cover up

578
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,470
the real reason Palmer was assassinated.

579
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,630
This is according to Jack.

580
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,570
This is according to the man who killed Palmer.

581
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,470
I heard his dying confession.

582
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,340
You'll find his body at the refinery,

583
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,170
just north of the city, at Variel and Topanga.

584
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,030
Chloe, do you have evidence that Palmer's assassination

585
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,690
has anything to do with the Summit?

586
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,030
No

587
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,620
No. Jack's trying to figure all that out.

588
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,170
How? Where is he?

589
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,020
I can't tell you.

590
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,060
Why not?

591
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,790
Because I don't think you believe him.

592
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,430
I think you're just trying to arrest him.

593
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,260
Chloe, I'm not going to ask you again.

594
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,770
I'm ordering you to tell me where Jack is.

595
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,830
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,470
I'd like to tell you, but I can't.

597
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,870
Chloe!

598
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,260
Sir?

599
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,200
Bring her back to CTU.

600
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,270
Curtis, take a team to the refinery.

601
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,580
See what you can find there.

602
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,720
Edgar, make sure Chloe goes into a holding cell

603
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,830
when she gets back.

604
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,960
That woman, Chloe...

605
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,180
she told me some stuff about what you used to do.

606
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,770
Yeah, well, she shouldn't have.

607
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,160
Why did you have to lie?

608
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,470
Couldn't you have just told us the truth?

609
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:01,930
First of all, Derek,

610
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,000
you have to understand that I never thought anything

611
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,340
like this could ever happen.

612
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,170
After your mother rented me that room,

613
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,570
I started to remember what it was like to have a family.

614
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,970
How nice it was.

615
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,930
I started to believe that a guy

616
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,970
like me could actually get a second chance.

617
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,970
I know you don't believe this now...

618
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,870
but I really do care about you.

619
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,770
And I care about your mother.

620
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,170
I hope, one day, you can understand that.

621
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,330
Charles?

622
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,970
Evelyn said you wanted to talk to me?

623
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,030
I do.

624
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,730
Did Walt find the tape of the phone call?

625
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,720
I told him approximately when it took place.

626
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,770
Why don't we sit down?

627
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,370
No. I don't want to sit down.

628
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,570
All right.

629
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,870
You don't need to be concerned that there's any

630
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,090
connection between David's death and the phone call

631
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,290
that he made to you.

632
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,380
He said it was a matter of national security.

633
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,570
Those were his exact words.

634
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,670
There's got to be a connection, of course.

635
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,970
There isn't.

636
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,170
David was killed by an unstable ex-CTU agent.

637
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,360
This was not a conspiracy.

638
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,690
This was one man acting out of some kind of grudge.

639
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,860
Did you hear the call?

640
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,070
Marty, can we just drop this?

641
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,470
Did you or didn't you hear it?!

642
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,520
Martha, it's David Palmer.

643
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,330
Did I wake you?

644
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,800
No, no, David, not at all.

645
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,280
What's going on?

646
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,630
I need to talk to you.

647
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,070
It's hardly a matter of national security,

648
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,460
but I'm hosting a charity dinner next month

649
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,590
for the Art in Action Scholarship Program.

650
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,670
No. That's not what he said.

651
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,220
No. That's not it.

652
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,930
I would very much like you and the president to be there...

653
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,170
No. That is not it. That is not it, Charles.

654
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,080
That's not it.

655
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,490
Let me...

656
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,870
Martha, listen!

657
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,480
- Thank you, Martha. - Of course.

658
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,930
Please send the president my best.

659
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,670
That's not what he said.

660
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,530
Yes, it is.

661
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,170
No, that is... that is a trick.

662
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,080
Listen to me...

663
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,930
-I am not crazy.

664
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,870
- Marty... Martha! - I know what I heard!

665
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,160
I know what I heard.

666
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,370
I spoke to Dr. Hill.

667
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,530
He said if you were not consistent

668
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,630
with your medication, you could become disoriented.

669
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,170
Your memory can be affected.

670
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,270
He said that?

671
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,570
Yes!

672
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:55,130
That's why you remember something different.

673
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,970
I know you don't like how these pills make you feel,

674
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,070
but you need to take them.

675
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,170
If Jack was responsible for President Palmer's assassination,

676
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,490
why would Chloe cover for him?

677
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,840
It just doesn't make sense.

678
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,190
There's something else going on here,

679
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,960
and we're missing it.

680
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,670
NSA just intercepted some chatter

681
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,370
identifying the summit as a target.

682
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,130
We're sourcing it now,

683
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,870
but the reliability is approaching 95%.

684
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,330
Is there a timeframe?

685
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,770
Within the next 15 minutes.

686
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,170
That's when the Russian President is scheduled to land.

687
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,730
President Logan said he will not postpone this summit.

688
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,770
In light of this, he may not have a choice.

689
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,470
Put me through to Mike Novick.

690
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,270
I'm watching Suvarov's helicopter leave the airbase.

691
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,470
His arrival at the retreat is on schedule.

692
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,630
As are we.

693
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,210
We'll go dark now.

694
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,890
No communication until after you strike.

695
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,170
I will monitor your progress from here.

696
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,380
Understood.

697
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,570
I'll touch you.

698
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,730
Mr. President?

699
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,320
Yeah, Mike, what is it?

700
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,230
CTU has confirmed intelligence suggesting

701
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,370
President Suvarov's helicopter will be targeted.

702
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,870
How good is this intelligence?

703
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,630
Very good.

704
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,230
They're updating their recommendation

705
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,870
that you delay or reschedule.

706
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,230
No.

707
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,670
I've told them, I'm telling you.

708
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,030
I will not postpone this summit!

709
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,370
Then at least, have Suvarov alter his arrival plan.

710
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,690
His chopper can land at a different site

711
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,580
and he can be brought here by motorcade.

712
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,430
The risk would be substantially reduced.

713
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,290
And the impact of his arrival would also be reduced.

714
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,270
I've got the media waiting

715
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,270
for a landing five minutes from now!

716
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:37,630
Mr. President...

717
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,070
I don't want to hear it, Walt.

718
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,430
It's up to Secret Service and the Air Force

719
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,290
to protect our airspace!

720
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,070
Make sure they do the job.

721
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,970
There's your mom.

722
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,670
Hey.

723
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,070
I'm sorry about the way I treated you earlier.

724
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,570
You're a good kid.

725
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,570
Go get your mom.

726
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,570
Mom?!

727
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,870
Oh, my God!

728
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,370
Oh, are you okay?

729
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,270
I was so worried!

730
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,020
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,330
You got to tell me right now

732
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,670
what the hell is going on here, Frank.

733
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,070
My name's not Frank.

734
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,870
It's Jack Bauer.

735
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,870
I lied to you.

736
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,170
I lied to you about a lot of things.

737
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,730
I'll explain as soon as I can,

738
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,770
but right now, you and Derek need to go to this address.

739
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,820
CTU?

740
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,830
Counterterrorist Unit.

741
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,130
I used to work there.

742
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,970
You need to ask for a man named Bill Buchanan.

743
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,570
Tell him I sent you.

744
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,470
I'm sorry.

745
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,870
I have to go.

746
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,370
When we get there, what do we tell him?

747
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,370
Tell him the truth.

748
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,270
Where can I find the Baggage Claim Supervisor?

749
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,570
Down that hall to the left.

750
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,670
Thank you.

751
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,020
DOD is still giving us the all clear

752
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,570
on the air space and the retreat.

753
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,170
Any word from our agents on the ground?

754
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,030
Okay.

755
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,970
I'm all quiet so far.

756
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,470
But if they're going to attack the helicopter,

757
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,970
it's going to be now.

758
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,500
- Hi, Mr. President... - It's a pleasure to see you.

759
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,270
Our intel must have been wrong.

760
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,870
Mom, do you see those men?

761
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,370
Yeah.

762
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,770
That's where Jack went.

763
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,770
Something's wrong.

764
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,130
I have to warn Jack.

765
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,170
Derek, where are you going?

766
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,030
Come back here!

767
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,570
Derek! Come back here!

768
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,270
Derek!

769
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,330
Come back here!

770
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,170
- Wait! - I have to get my son.

771
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,010
No, you can't! You can't!

772
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,920
Please move your car !

773
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,770
I've got to get my son.

774
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,580
Derek!

775
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,370
Get back in!

776
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,020
Why was President Palmer killed?!

777
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,370
I don't know what you're talking about.

778
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,770
You are going to tell me what I want to know.

779
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,570
It's just a question of how much you want it to hurt.

780
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,970
No!

781
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,570
Quiet!

782
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,070
Quiet!

783
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,430
You will not be harmed as long as

784
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,270
your president complies with our wishes.

785
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,570
Derek!

786
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,370
Ma'am, stop!

787
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,070
My son is in danger

788
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,470
I have to get my son!

789
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,270
I have dealt with the Martha Logan situation.

790
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,870
She's not going to be a problem?

791
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,530
No.

792
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,420
I was able to alter the tape of the phone call

793
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,270
before the President heard it.

794
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,830
There's no longer any evidence on my end that

795
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,370
Palmer was trying to warn her about the attack.

796
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,670
Good.

797
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,570
The terminal and the hostages are secure.

798
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,770
It'll only be a matter of time

799
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,570
until the president is notified of the demands.
