《反恐24小时》 前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,060
哈桑在伊斯兰共和国的卫队
Hassan's security forces in the Islamic Republic

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,056
正横扫首都  逮捕反对派领导人
are sweeping through the capital, arresting opposition leaders.

6
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:22,064
他若继续一意孤行  会威胁和平公约的合法性
And if he continues, it may delegitimize the peace accord.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,018
总统阁下  如果你违背自己的人权宣言
I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr. President,

8
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:29,044
我是不能为你担保的
if you renege on your human rights obligations.

9
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:31,068
我兄弟想置我于死地
My brother tried to kill me,

10
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:35,045
而帮凶竟然是我自己的手下
helped by elements within my own government.

11
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:37,002
很明显  刺杀哈桑总统
Apparently, killing President Hassan

12
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,099
只是他弟弟计划的一部分
was only part of his brother's plan.

13
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:43,002
反恐小组已确定  他还试图弄到武器级的铀
CTU now believes he's also trying to acquire weapons-grade uranium.

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,003
什么时候给我浓缩铀棒
When can I take possession of the rods?

15
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,003
钱一到就给你
As soon as we have the money.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,096
我找到了一个能治疗他的医生
I found a doctor who can treat him.

17
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,050
不找医生
No doctors.

18
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:52,047
当局知道核原料的事情
The authorities know about the nuclear material.

19
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:55,087
把欧力格送医会引狼入室
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.

20
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:57,034
莱文医生
Dr. Levine.

21
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,011
你们是怎么进来的
How did you get in here?

22
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:59,001
我弟弟病了
My brother is sick.

23
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,069
我帮你叫救护车
I'm gonna call you an ambulance.

24
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:03,031
不能让别人知道
No one can know about this.

25
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:05,042
不  别这样
No, no.

26
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:07,065
你到底想从我这得到什么
What do you want from me?

27
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,084
你是反恐小组的数据分析师
You're a data analyst for CTU.

28
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:11,098
你有渠道可以搞到很多好东西
You got access to all sorts of good stuff.

29
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:14,039
但都是有限制的
Yeah, but not unrestricted access.

30
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:16,049
必须得值至少六位数
Payout's got to be at least six figures.

31
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:19,033
你在俄罗斯黑帮中做了近两年的卧底
You were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian Mob.

32
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,033
你的意思是让我打回内部去吗
You're asking me to go back in?

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,070
瓦德米尔对她极其痴情  以至举止粗暴
Vladimir Laitanan was completely obsessed with her. It turned violent.

34
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,072
他有强奸她吗
Did he rape her?

35
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:27,074
看起来他至少曾几次试图强奸她
It looks like he tried a couple of times.

36
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,059
那现在我们能谈谈这笔买卖了吗
Can we talk about this deal now?

37
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:31,028
我也希望是这么简单
I wish it were that simple.

38
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:32,087
-把她绑起来  -什么
- Tie her up. - What?

39
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:35,011
你犯了个大错  这是笔千载难逢的买卖
Look, you're making a mistake. This is the chance of lifetime.

40
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:37,024
任务已经结束了
This operation's over.

41
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,025
瓦德米尔没上钩
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

42
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,050
蕾妮  我是杰克
Renee, it's Jack.

43
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,095
我知道你听得见  我现在就赶过来
I know you can hear me. I'm on my way now.

44
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:44,045
你不想做这笔买卖
You don't want to do this deal,

45
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:46,052
那就杀了我好了
then you might as well just kill me,

46
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:49,069
因为这笔买卖是我仅有的东西
because this deal is the only thing that I have.

47
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,069
开枪啊
Do it!

48
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:53,029
开枪啊
Pull the trigger!

49
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,057
我只是需要确定一下
I had to be sure.

50
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,027
杰克  你在吗
Jack, are you there?

51
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:01,030
怎么了
What's going on?

52
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,077
她混进去了
She's in.

53
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:04,017
他们相信她了
They bought her cover.

54
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:09,082
以下事件发生在晚上九点到十点
The following takes place between 9:00 P.M. and 10:00 P.M.

55
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:32,033
蕾妮  我看到你了
Renee, I've got a visual on you.

56
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,064
我关闭一会通讯器
I'm going off comm for a minute.

57
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,071
没事吧
You all right?

58
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:44,056
我是反恐小组  奥布赖恩
CTU, O'Brian.

59
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:45,045
克罗伊  我是杰克  
Chloe, it's Jack.

60
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:47,080
你监听下蕾妮的通讯器  我要和黑斯廷斯谈
I want you to monitor Renee's comm. I need to speak to Hastings.

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,090
好  我帮你接进去
Okay, I'll put you through.

62
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:49,093
我在  杰克  请讲
I'm here, Jack. Go ahead.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,007
我们要尽快把蕾妮·沃克撤出这次任务
We need to pull Renee Walker out now.

64
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:52,043
为什么
Based on what?

65
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,027
因为她会使自己和这次任务陷入险境
Because she's a danger to herself and this mission.

66
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,067
十分钟之前  勒塔纳威胁要处死她
Ten minutes ago, Laitanan threatened to execute her,

67
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:57,077
她说她早就活腻了
and she said she was sick of living

68
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:59,001
就想一死  她是当真的
and wanted to die and she meant it.

69
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,024
她肯定是给他下套呢
She must've been playing him.

70
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:01,091
不  她根本不在乎自己的死活
No. She doesn't care what happens to her,

71
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,041
这就让她变得极其危险
that's what makes her dangerous.

72
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:05,008
她就像一个定时炸弹
She's like a bomb ready to go off.

73
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:06,068
我们要在出事前救她出来
We need to get her out of there before that happens.

74
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:09,045
我理解你的心情  但在找到浓缩铀棒之前
Look, I understand your concern, but we can't just roll up this operation

75
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:11,025
不能随随便便结束这次行动
before we find those nuclear rods.

76
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,039
我们可以逮捕勒塔纳
We can arrest Laitanan.

77
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:13,066
如果他知道浓缩铀棒在哪里
If he knows how to find the rods,

78
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:14,092
我肯定能撬开他的嘴
I will make him talk.

79
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,035
如果我没猜错你的言下之意的话
If you're saying what I think you are,

80
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:17,072
我们不再干你那勾当了
we don't do that anymore.

81
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,059
那就做你们擅长的事好了
Then you people do what you do well-

82
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,009
可以给他豁免权什么的
offer him immunity or something.

83
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:22,076
这是俄罗斯犯罪集团
This is the Russian Syndicate.

84
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,003
他们行事极其谨慎  很会保护自己
They're very secretive, they protect their own.

85
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,083
勒塔纳不大可能会合作的
It is highly unlikely that Laitanan would cooperate.

86
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,007
那你最好再想个办法出来
Then you better find another way,

87
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:30,070
我不会因为反恐小组的失职
because I am not gonna let Renee die

88
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,004
而让蕾妮白白送命的
because CTU did their job badly.

89
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,004
绝对不会  你听明白了吗
I will not let that happen. Do you understand me?

90
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,037
杰克  如果你有其他的主意  我洗耳恭听
Jack, if you can think of something, I will listen.

91
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:37,049
但是现在
But right now,

92
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,038
蕾妮是我们化解危机的唯一希望
Renee's the only hope we have of neutralizing this threat.

93
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:43,065
我的命令是  让她继续卧底
And on my order, she stays in play.

94
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:48,008
杰克
Jack?

95
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:52,029
我扮成买家进去时会想办法把她救出来
I'll find a way to get her out when I go in as the buyer.

96
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,043
我会继续扮演她需要的角色
I'll stay under her place.

97
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,054
这样可以吗
Do we have a deal?

98
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:59,097
只要不影响这次任务的进程就可以
As long as you can do it without risking the mission.

99
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,097
我向你保证不会的
I give you my word.

100
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,081
奥迪斯探员和战术小队会和你在集结待命区会合
Agent Ortiz will meet you at the staging area with a TAC team.

101
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:08,018
他有你卧底所需要的一切资料
He'll have everything you need for your cover.

102
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,052
稍等  他们要走了
Hold on. They're moving.

103
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:11,015
我要重新打开通讯器了
I need to get back on comm.

104
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,012
我们先回店里
We'll go back to my shop,

105
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,019
再谈你介绍的买家
and we will discuss this buyer of yours.

106
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:42,001
丹娜
Dana...

107
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,057
开始给汉密尔顿堡的核突发事件组
start forwarding mission status reports

108
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,069
作行动状况的实时汇报
to the Nuclear Emergency Team at Fort Hamilton.

109
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:49,066
让他们准备好  一找到浓缩铀棒立刻行动  
I want them ready to go in as soon as we find these nuclear rods.

110
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:51,022
我马上办  长官
I'm on it, sir.

是我
It's me.

我有主意了
I've got something.

你速度还真快啊
Damn, you're fast.

Okay, hold on.

122

我们听听看
Let's hear it.

123
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,040
是纽约警局的证据保留室
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

124
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,064
清单显示  
According to the manifest,

125
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:36,060
当地扫黄缉毒科刚截获了一批贩毒赃款
a local vice group just impounded a stash of drug money.

126
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,077
会在证据室保留48小时
It'll be held there for the next 48 hours.

127
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:40,021
多少钱
How much?

128
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:41,061
十二万
$120,000.

129
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,068
好  有何计划
All right, what's the plan?

130
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,011
你进去取出来
You go in and take it.

131
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,002
你什么意思  抢劫警察局吗
What do you mean, break into a police station?

132
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:53,045
你疯了吗
What, are you out of your mind?

133
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,085
那不是警察局  只是一个仓库而已
It's not a police station. It's a warehouse.

134
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:56,086
基本都是自动警报系统
Most of the security is automated.

135
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:58,052
我在这就可以加以操控
I can manipulate it from here.

136
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:00,053
你进去  拿钱走人
You walk in, you walk out with the cash.

137
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,043
我会一步步指导你该怎么做的
I'll talk you through it.

138
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,063
我拿到他们的密码之后
I need to access their security codes,

139
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,083
做一张钥匙卡帮你进入仓库
work up a keycard to get you inside the warehouse.

140
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,003
多久
How long?

141
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,024
三十分钟后在反恐小组门口等我
Meet me outside CTU in 30 minutes.

142
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,024
处理好你的紧急情况了吗
Did you take care of your situation?

143
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,094
什么情况
Situation?

144
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,031
那个让你不得不离开工作的大秘密
The big mystery you had to leave work for.

145
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,031
对  现在没事了
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

146
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,025
有事吗  阿洛
What do you need, Arlo?

147
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:24,008
我的无人机的防抱死制动系统有5%的滞后
I'm getting five percent lag in my Drone's ABS controls.

148
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:26,099
我的主机超负荷运转  处理器都开始发烫了
With everything going on, I think I'm just running hot.

149
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,042
我会在辅助服务器上多给你分些内存空间
Okay, I'll make sure to free up some memory space on the auxiliary servers.

150
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,078
多谢
Thanks.

151
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,012
要是有什么事情困扰你的话
You know, if there's something bothering you,

152
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:37,060
你可以趴在我肩膀上哭
you've always got my shoulder to cry on.

153
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:39,085
或是靠在其他身体部位哭也可以
Or any other body part.

154
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:42,004
我记住了
I will keep that in mind.

155
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:43,033
不过现在你最好集中精力
But, for now, why don't you focus on

156
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:45,053
为沃克和鲍尔提供空中监控支持
running aerial support for Walker and Bauer?

157
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:46,096
好吧
Okay.

158
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:20,036
卢戈  你歇会儿吧
Lugo, take a break.

159
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,077
我想跟她单独谈谈
I want to talk to her alone.

160
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,021
好吧  你引起我的兴趣了
All right, you have my attention.

161
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:38,090
说说你这个买主的来头
Tell me about this buyer.

162
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:43,010
他叫恩斯特·迈尔  德国军火商
His name's Ernst Meier. German arms dealer.

163
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,073
没听说过这个人  
Never heard of him.

164
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:46,044
他主要在亚洲做生意  
He does most of his business in Asia;

165
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:48,050
最近才到北美来开拓市场
he just started branching out into North America.

166
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:49,085
他想买什么货呢
What's he looking to buy?

167
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:51,092
武器级别的铀
Weapons-grade uranium.

168
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:56,002
你是认真的吗
You're serious.

169
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,002
很认真
Very.

170
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:01,076
俄罗斯犯罪集团从乌克兰走私了一批浓缩铀棒
Someone in the Russian Syndicate smuggled nuclear fuel rods out of the Ukraine.

171
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:03,088
他们打算在黑市上公开销售
They're planning on selling them on the open market.

172
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:08,053
我... 我不知道你在说什么
I... I have no idea what you're talking about.

173
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,074
真的  蕾妮
I don't, Renee.

174
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:13,020
但你可以找到渠道  你手眼通天
But you can find out. You're very well connected.

175
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,060
我向来赞赏你的野心
I have always admired your ambition,

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,048
但是你在跟魔鬼打交道
but you're chasing the devil.

177
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,052
买卖AK-47  不会有人在意
Dealing AK-47s- no one really cares.

178
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:26,055
但核原料的话...
But nuclear material?

179
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,053
丰厚回报之下必有勇夫
But the profit is worth it.

180
00:08:32,003 --> 00:08:34,015
你缺钱吗
You need money, huh?

181
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,037
那你随时可以为我工作
You can always come work for me.

182
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:39,047
不  这笔买卖可以令我不用再为任何人工作了
No, I'm doing this so I don't ever have to work for anyone.

183
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:42,087
请坐
Have a seat.

184
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:45,028
如果我帮你找到渠道的话
If I could find out...

185
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:48,058
我能得到多少提成
...what would it be worth?

186
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,065
总额的30%
30% of the deal.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,051
这笔钱你这一辈子都花不完
that is more money than you could possibly know what to do with.

188
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:01,011
迈尔说这些浓缩铀很快就要被别人买走了
Look, Meier says these rods are going to be sold soon,

189
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,032
所以  如果你想参与竞价的话
so if we want to make a counter bid,

190
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,076
就需要尽快行动
it has to happen fast.

191
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:07,089
如果你不想参与的话就告诉我  我去找别人
If you don't know anything, tell me, so I can go somewhere else.

192
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,051
你跟这个人熟吗  信任他吗
How well do you know this man? You trust him?

193
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:16,003
他是我最信任的人  我跟他一起两年了
There's no one I trust more. I've been with him for two years.

194
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,046
"一起"是什么意思
What do you mean "With"?

195
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,008
生意上的关系
It's professional.

196
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:23,022
你到底能不能帮我们
Can you help us or not?

197
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,061
我去打几个电话
I'll make a few calls,

198
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:32,025
摸一摸情况
see what I can find out.

199
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:34,023
不过呢
But, uh,

200
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,015
我得跟这个迈尔聊一聊
I'm going to have to meet this Meier.

201
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:39,063
-为了表示诚意  他要先交钱  -交多少
- And I need a good faith payment up front. - How much?

202
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,076
五百万
Five million.

203
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,024
这可是一大笔钱啊  瓦德
That's a lot of money, Vlad.

204
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,042
听着  我打这些电话也是冒很大风险的
Look, I'm taking big risk just making these calls.

205
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,070
况且  五百万同你的买主用来买浓缩铀的
Besides, 5 million is nothing compared to what your buyer

206
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,005
全款相比简直是九牛一毛
will have to pay for nuclear fuel rods.

207
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,031
好吧
Fine.

208
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:55,084
我去问问他  但是我不能给你打包票
I'll ask him, but I can't make any promises.

209
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,091
他要我帮他的话  就要付这笔入伙费
If he wants my help, that's the price of admission.

210
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,024
好吧
Okay.

211
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:04,087
第12街和市场街拐角有一间车库
There's a parking garage on the corner of 12th and Market Street.

212
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:07,014
有人会在那车库的屋顶上同他见面
Someone will meet him there, on the roof.

213
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:08,077
一旦钱划到我们的账户上
Once the money is in our account,

214
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:12,062
就把他带过来  我们再谈
they'll bring him back here, we will talk.

215
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,048
我给他打电话
I'll give him a call.

216
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,097
见到你很高兴
It's good to see you.

217
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:24,054
你又要开始让我辗转难眠了
You're going to make me start losing sleep again.

218
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,065
我会把迈尔的口信捎给你的
I'll let you know what Meier says.

219
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,030
我去叫我的人准备
I'll tell my men.

220
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,016
你们单独聊吧
I'll give you privacy for your call.

221
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,064
杰克  你在听吗
Jack, were you listening?

222
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:09,078
嗯  我们准备把钱转到他的账户上
Yeah, we're ready to wire the money to his account.

223
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:10,088
你什么时候能到那里
When can you be there?

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,019
我准备好伪装之后马上过去
As soon as I finish prepping my cover.

225
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:13,091
我距离集合待命区已经很近了
I'm almost at the staging area.

226
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,028
最多三十分钟
30 minutes tops.

227
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,060
你那里情况如何
How you holding up?

228
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:21,013
跟禽兽同处一室真的很难熬
It's hard to be in the same room with this son of a bitch.

229
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,019
我能搞定
I can handle it.

230
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,083
我会尽快赶到的
I'll be there as soon as I can.

231
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:26,083
好的
Okay.

232
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,004
吗啡很快就会起作用了
Morphine will take effect in just a few moments.

233
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:45,085
别担心  欧力格
Don't worry, Oleg.

234
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,060
你会好起来的
You're going to be fine.

235
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:50,033
也许... 你告诉我你兄弟身上到底
It, uh... it might help me if I knew

236
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,090
发生了什么会对我诊断大有帮助
exactly what happened to your brother.

237
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:55,003
他怎么会受到武器级别铀的放射污染
How did he get exposed to weapons-grade uranium?

238
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:59,009
不用你操心  你只需要确保他能活命
Don't worry about that. Just make sure he lives.

239
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:07,073
又是他打来的  对吗
It's him again, isn't it?

240
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:12,024
这是他第二次打来电话了  你应该接听
The second time he's called. You should answer it.

241
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,022
喂
Hello?

242
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,065
你怎么不接电话呢
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

243
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:19,088
我打了两次了
I called you twice.

244
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,029
可能过隧道时没了信号
Must have been in the tunnel.

245
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:24,005
乌兰娜说你们还没到别墅那里
Ulana says you're not at the house yet.

246
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,078
-你们在哪  -堵车了
- Where are you? - Stuck in traffic.

247
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:27,047
跟她说还要再等一会儿
Tell her it's going to be a while.

248
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:28,071
欧力格怎么样了
How's Oleg?

249
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,045
他没事  睡觉呢
He's okay. Sleeping.

250
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:32,083
到了别墅后马上给我打电话
Let me know when you get to the house.

251
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,035
好的
I will.

252
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,086
是他  对吗
It was him, wasn't it?

253
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,086
别担心  好吗
Don't worry, okay?

254
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,011
当他发现时你已经好了
By the time he finds out, you'll already have been treated.

255
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:50,014
那就没问题了
Then it won't matter.

256
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:57,003
只是你弟弟的检查结果到了
Hey, it's just your brother's test results.

257
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:04,012
你要是敢跟我耍小聪明的话
You say or do anything that I don't like,

258
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:06,055
我的人就会宰了你老婆和女儿
and my men will kill your wife and daughter.

259
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,017
开门去
Open the door.

260
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:12,048
您要的血常规化验  医生
The blood work you ordered, Doctor.

261
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:13,056
谢谢
Thank you.

262
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,094
我发现这里没有病人姓名
Uh, I noticed there was no patient name.

263
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,096
对  你说得对
Uh, yeah, you're right.

264
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,050
-我忘记填了  -那我帮您填上
- I forgot to put that down. - Oh, well, I can do it for you.

265
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,085
不用  我待会自己填
No, I'll take care of it later.

266
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,032
你还好吗  医生
Is everything okay, Doctor?

267
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,077
我很好
Fine.

268
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:26,076
只是工作得比我预计的晚了一些  
I'm just working a little later than I expected.

269
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,061
那好吧
Okay.

270
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,013
表现不错
You did good.

271
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:35,038
结果如何
What does it say?

272
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:40,098
你兄弟受到了至少四百雷姆的放射污染
Your brother has been exposed to at least 400 rems,

273
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:44,012
放射物的化学毒性导致了肾衰竭
and the chemical toxicity of the radiation is causing renal failure.

274
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,063
我知道情况严重
I know it's serious.

275
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,008
你到底能不能治好他
Can you help him or not?

276
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:49,021
他得进行骨髓移植
He needs a bone marrow transplant.

277
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:52,034
需要一个设备齐全的六人外科手术小组
That requires a six-man surgical team in a fully equipped facility.

278
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:56,012
此时此地  你总能做些什么
There has to be something you can do right here, right now.

279
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:59,030
我可以给他开些能有助于排出放射物
There are some drugs I could give him that will help flush out the radiation

280
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:00,099
并促进白细胞修复的药物
and stimulate white blood cell repair,

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,069
这只是权宜之计  我不能保证他会康复
but that's a half measure. I can't guarantee he'll recover.

282
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:10,027
我弟弟不会死
My brother is not going to die.

283
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:12,045
他的命掌握在你的手里  医生
It's up to you, Doctor.

284
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:15,052
快去
Now get to work.

285
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:25,094
好  明白
Okay, got it.

286
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:29,035
反恐小组打来电话
That was CTU.

287
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:30,071
你的海外账户准备完毕
Your offshore account's in place.

288
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,041
他们正在把汇钱方法发送到你的掌上电脑上
They're forwarding instructions to your PDA on how to wire the money.

289
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:34,091
借过
Excuse me.

290
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,058
我跟黑斯廷斯谈过了
I spoke with Hastings.

291
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,074
他说一旦你接上头
He said, as soon as you're under

292
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,032
确定勒塔纳能帮我们找到浓缩铀棒
and we have confirmation that Laitanan can get us to the nuclear rods,

293
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:42,096
我们就马上把蕾妮·沃克救出来
we're pulling Renee Walker out.

294
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,021
没错
That's right.

295
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,018
怎么了  杰克
What's going on, Jack?

296
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,080
黑斯廷斯说她情绪不稳定
Hastings said something about her being unstable.

297
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:50,044
我没时间解释
I don't have time to explain it.

298
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:51,097
听我指挥就行
Just follow my lead.

299
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:53,071
不暴露身份的话怎么继续行动
How do you want to work this without breaking cover?

300
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,087
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

301
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,085
好吧  有两个飞车射击队协调作战
All right. Well, I got two teams running coordinated drive-bys.

302
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,075
当她完成使命时  他们随时准备营救她出来
They'll be ready to extract her when she's clear.

303
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,007
不行  这是他们的地盘
No. These guys own this neighborhood.

304
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,028
肯定到处都有眼线
They'll have eyes everywhere.

305
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:04,012
你的人很可能被发现
Your men will run the risk of being spotted.

306
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:05,036
我是老江湖了  杰克
I've done this before, Jack.

307
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:07,058
我在费卢杰执行过类似的行动
I ran an operation just like it in Fallujah.

308
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:10,055
但我是指挥官  按我的命令行事
And I'm in command. You're going to do exactly what I tell you.

309
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,042
杰克  做好准备
Jack, stand by.

310
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:15,067
勒塔纳回来了
Laitanan's back.

311
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:17,057
我得去监听  失陪了
I need to listen to this. Excuse me.

312
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,068
我和手下打过招呼了
I spoke to my men.

313
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,019
你和买家通过电话了吗
Did you get your buyer on the phone?

314
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:29,020
他同意预付这笔钱
He agreed to the money.

315
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:31,020
-二十分钟内到停车场  -很好
- He'll be at the parking garage in 20 minutes. - Very good.

316
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:32,066
那我们还有点时间叙叙旧
We have a little time to catch up.

317
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,055
还喜欢喝单一纯麦威士忌吗
Do you still like your single malts?

318
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:36,076
现在不想喝
Uh, not right now.

319
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,087
确定吗  这可是三十年陈的酒啊
You sure? It's a 30 year.

320
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,079
不用  谢谢
No, thanks.

321
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:44,045
刚在河边你说什么来着
What you said earlier... down at the river...

322
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:49,002
你厌倦了生活  就想一死
you were tired of living, wanted to die.

323
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,046
发生了什么事
What happened to you?

324
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,088
这不重要
It's not important.

325
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:55,042
对我来说重要
It is to me.

326
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,006
不用担心
Look, you don't have to worry about it.

327
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:01,012
只要交易完成  其他的都将不再重要了
Once I make this deal, none of it will matter.

328
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:05,032
过去那几年  受罪的不止是你一个人
Well, you're not the only one who's been suffering these past few years.

329
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,039
虽然难以启齿
It's hard for me to admit,

330
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,038
但是  我从未原谅自己对你的所作所为
but, uh... I never forgave myself for what I did to you.

331
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:25,086
过去的都过去了  忘了吧
It's in the past. Forget it.

332
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:28,003
我不想忘记
I don't want to forget it.

333
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,061
那晚我喝得太多了  意识不清醒
I had too much to drink that night, i wasn't thinking clearly.

334
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:38,006
从来没见你道过歉  史无前例啊
Never heard you apologize for anything. It's definitely a first.

335
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:40,063
我只是想纠正过去的错误
Look, I'm just trying to make things right.

336
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,019
你用不着这么得理不饶人吧
You don't have to be such a bitch about it.

337
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:44,034
我得理不饶人了吗  也许我应该道歉
Was I being a bitch? Maybe I should apologize.

338
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:47,016
真是巾帼不让须眉  你从不低头  是不是
Oh, you're something else. You never back down, do you?

339
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:52,092
我想念我们斗嘴的样子
I've missed our little arguments.

340
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:04,092
靠近我你还是会紧张
You're still nervous around me.

341
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,065
我不该大惊小怪
I shouldn't be surprised.

342
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,057
不是因为你
It's not you.

343
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,034
那是因为别人吗
Someone else?

344
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,028
不是
No.

345
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,087
那是怎么回事
What is it, then?

346
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:16,090
听着  我只是...
Look, I'm just...

347
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,060
我只是担心这次交易  那么多钱都悬着呢
I'm just nervous about the deal. Could be a lot of money at stake.

348
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:24,012
如果你愿意  你得到的不仅仅是钱
There's more for you here than just money, if you want it.

349
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,071
听着
Look...

350
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,049
我来不是为了这个
I didn't come here for this.

351
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,065
是吗  你有那么多人可以选
Really. All the people you could've gone to,

352
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:35,081
可你偏偏挑了我
you knocked on my door.

353
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,038
因为你人脉广
Because you're connected.

354
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,020
-就因为这个吗  -对
- That's the only reason? - Yes.

355
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,053
我不信
I don't believe you.

356
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:43,048
那是你的事
That's your problem.

357
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:44,025
管好你的舌头
You should watch your tongue.

358
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:45,071
否则不定哪天就没了
You might lose it one day.

359
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:50,090
你刚说我可以去冲个澡
Uh... you said that I could get cleaned up.

360
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:53,056
是的
Yeah.

361
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,074
洗手间里有淋浴
Bathroom has a shower.

362
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,065
谢谢
Thank you.

363
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,082
奥迪斯探员  立刻行动
Agent Ortiz, we need to move now.

364
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:23,058
蕾妮给她的买家打过电话了
Renee called her buyer.

365
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:25,050
他同意预先支付五百万
He agreed to pay the $5 million up front.

366
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:28,016
你去会会他  带几个弟兄过去
I want you to meet with him. Take a couple men.

367
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,092
瓦德  做核武器买卖是个错误
This is a mistake, Vlad. Getting involved in nuclear arms-

368
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:33,051
这不是钱多钱少的问题
it doesn't matter how much money is at stake.

369
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:36,041
我没打算做这个买卖
I have no intention of pursuing this deal.

370
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:37,058
什么意思
What do you mean?

371
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:42,046
跟买家接头后  钱一进账
When you've picked up the buyer, when the money has been transferred into our account,

372
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,098
就干掉他  把尸体扔到河里
you kill him, put him in the river,

373
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:46,052
钱我们自己留着
keep the money for ourselves.

374
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,098
蕾妮怎么办
What about Renee?

375
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,047
从今以后她就和我们一伙了
She'll be working with us from now on.

376
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,035
可杀了买家  她肯定不乐意
We are going to kill her buyer. She's not going to be happy about that.

377
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,061
你没听到她的话吗  她已经一无所有了
You heard what she said. She's got nothing left.

378
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:02,076
无处可去  是一个绝望的女人了
Nowhere to go. Desperate woman.

379
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,098
我给了她活下去的理由
I give her reason to live.

380
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:07,074
懂了没
Okay?

381
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:10,004
交给我了
I'll take care of it.

382
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,034
哈桑总统的卫队
President Hassan's security forces...

383
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:26,021
仍在镇压反对派
they're still cracking down on the opposition,

384
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,014
并且没有任何停止的迹象
and they're not showing any signs of letting up.

385
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:32,017
恐怕哈桑总统对您的忠告置若罔闻了
I'm afraid your warning to President Hassan has fallen on deaf ears,

386
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:33,028
总统阁下
Madam President.

387
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,082
谁拍的视频
Who filmed this?

388
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:36,048
BBC的特约记者从一个目击者手里买的
Stringer for the BBC bought it from an eyewitness.

389
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:38,098
英国政府方面已经看过了
And they've already seen it on Downing Street.

390
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:40,078
所以伊桑想让你看看这个
That's why Ethan wanted you to see this now.

391
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:42,071
谣言四起
The rumors have already started

392
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:46,015
说是英国正打算拒绝签字同时退出和谈
that the British are pulling out as signatories to the accord.

393
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,005
那我得跟首相谈谈
Then I need to talk to the prime minister.

394
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:50,022
不仅是英国  总统阁下
It's not just the British, Madam President.

395
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:53,093
德国和埃及也纷纷表示要退出和谈
The Germans and Egyptians are also positioning themselves to pull out,

396
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,015
如果没有他们的支持
and if we lose their support...

397
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:57,013
和平会谈就胎死腹中了
The peace deal is dead.

398
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,033
如果让他们明白现在的事态
Maybe if they understood the circumstances

399
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,090
哈桑总统正努力阻止他弟弟获得核武器
that Hassan is trying to prevent his brother from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

400
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:05,072
恕我直言  总统阁下
With respect, Madam President,

401
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:08,055
如果这个消息散布出去了  势必会造成恐慌
sharing that intelligence with the delegates might spread a panic.

402
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:12,072
没错  但我还是需要争取一些时间
You're right, but I still need to buy some time.

403
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:18,093
召集各国代表
Assemble the representatives

404
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,046
让每个签署国都来出席会议
from every signatory country attending the conference.

405
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:26,003
我亲自去请求他们让和谈继续
I want to appeal to them myself to stay the course.

406
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:27,034
哈桑总统怎么办
What about President Hassan?

407
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:29,005
要邀请他吗
Shouldn't we include him?

408
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:31,091
还是先稳住其他代表的情绪吧
Not until I've taken the temperature of the other delegates.

409
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,012
我不想把他逼得太急了
I don't want to push him too hard.

410
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,022
这是什么
What is it?

411
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,074
按您的吩咐  这是被抓嫌犯们的背景资料
As you requested, these are backgrounds on all the detainees.

412
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,049
我们的卫队已对首都进行了初步搜捕
Our security police have completed their initial sweep of the capital city.

413
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,066
已有65名反对分子被捕
65 known members of the opposition have been arrested

414
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:55,010
正在对他们进行审问
and are being questioned.

415
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:56,023
有什么收获吗
Have you learned anything?

416
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,087
他们中有我弟弟的同党吗
Were any of them working with my brother?

417
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:00,094
现在还说不准
It's too early to tell.

418
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:07,027
怎么了  总统阁下
What's wrong, sir?

419
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:11,051
其中一名嫌犯...
One of the suspects...

420
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:15,038
是我国驻联合国代表团中一位代表的亲戚
has family connections to a member of my delegation here at the UN.

421
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:18,035
-谁  -贾莫特
- Who? - Jamot.

422
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,062
他们是表亲
They are cousins.

423
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:24,056
这不代表贾莫特和这次阴谋有瓜葛
That doesn't mean that Jamot is involved in any of this.

424
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:26,059
我们要确保万无一失
We need to make sure.

425
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:29,020
我们会调查他的通话记录和近期活动
We'll check his phone records and other recent activities

426
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,046
看是否有任何异常的地方
for any suspicious behavior.

427
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:33,090
很好  但我还是希望先拘留他
Good. But I also want him taken into custody.

428
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:36,044
-什么  -逮捕他
- Sir? - Arrest him.

429
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,041
带他到使馆接受审讯
Take him to our embassy for interrogation.

430
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,094
总统阁下  恕我直言
Mr. President, with respect,

431
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,032
贾莫特是您内阁核心中的信臣
Jamot is a trusted member of your inner circle.

432
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:46,078
现在指证他的证据还不足
The evidence against him is purely circumstantial.

433
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:53,009
我也曾一度信任我的弟弟
I trusted my brother as well.

434
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:56,085
您确定要这么做吗
Are you sure this is what you want?

435
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:58,009
他可是一名政府官员
He is a public official.

436
00:21:58,009 --> 00:21:59,054
逮捕他会被人察觉的
It will not go unnoticed.

437
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,092
我不在乎
I don't care!

438
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,039
我才不在乎别人怎么想
I don't care what anyone thinks.

439
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:10,060
我今天九死一生
I was almost killed today.

440
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,093
你难道已经忘了
Or have you forgotten?

441
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,049
我当时和您在同一辆车里  总统阁下
I was in the car with you, sir.

442
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:17,088
那你应该知道怎么做了
Then you should know what needs to be done.

443
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:20,054
是的  总统阁下
Yes, sir.

444
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,082
钥匙卡激活完毕
Keycard Activation Completed

445
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:00,038
-把我忘了吗  -什么
- Forget about me? - What?

446
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,051
我叫阿洛·格拉斯
My name's Arlo Glass.

447
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:03,005
我是你反恐小组的同事
I'm one of your coworkers at CTU.

448
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:06,045
你刚说你要去为辅助服务器释放内存空间
You said you'd free up some memory space on the auxiliary servers.

449
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,089
我正要去做
I'm getting to it.

450
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,079
都什么时代了  我们有重任在身
In which century? We're in the middle of an operation

451
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,083
而我的空中监测画面却处于龟速运行
and my aerial feed is running in slow-motion.

452
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,049
我接下来就去搞定它  阿洛
It's next on my list, Arlo.

453
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:15,053
你要去哪
Where are you going now?

454
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,060
上厕所  满意了吗
To the bathroom. Is that okay with you?

455
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:23,050
奥布赖恩
Hey, O'Brian,

456
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,040
你注意到丹娜有点怪怪的吗
you notice anything weird about Dana?

457
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,068
那位完美小姐吗
Miss Perfect?

458
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:27,091
她看起来有点心不在焉
She seems distracted,

459
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:29,084
老是找借口离开岗位
always making excuses to leave.

460
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:31,058
可能她就是不想见到你
Maybe she's avoiding you.

461
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:32,026
什么  
What?

462
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:34,091
如果有人整天色咪咪地看着我  我也会那么做
Well, that's what I would do if someone were drooling over me all day.

463
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:37,022
你该庆幸她没向人力资源部门打你的小报告
You're lucky she hasn't reported you to Human Resources.

464
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:38,038
如果你是在吃醋
If you weren't so jealous,

465
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:40,079
那我告诉你我是认真的
you'd see I was asking you a serious question.

466
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,059
哦  对  我吃醋了
Oh, yeah, I'm jealous.

467
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:46,026
拜托  请在我走开时窥视我的俏臀吧
Please, won't you stare at my ass as I walk away?

468
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,034
谢谢
Thank you.

469
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,080
不客气
You're welcome.

470
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:06,072
待在这
Stay here.

471
00:24:17,062 --> 00:24:20,086
这里有证据保留室所在位置及其地形图
This has the address and schematic of the evidence lockup.

472
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,093
从东南面的入口进去
You'll go through the southeast entrance.

473
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,087
用这张钥匙卡通过安检
This keycard will get you access.

474
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:28,077
我们怎么才能找到钱
How do we find the money?

475
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:30,087
证据存储箱都有编号
The evidence bins are numbered.

476
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,091
赃款箱的编号为4301
You're looking for 4301.

477
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,086
这是个专用的通讯器
This is a dedicated comm unit.

478
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:37,029
是一种耳机  戴上就能听到我说话了
It's an earpiece; you'll be able to hear me.

479
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:40,016
必须严格按我说的做  你就能自由进出了
Do exactly what I tell you to do and you'll be in and out.

480
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:41,093
没人会知道你去过那里
No one will know you were there.

481
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,078
听着  事成后
Listen... I help you do this

482
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:51,051
就别再来烦我了
and you never call me again.

483
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:53,006
就这么定了  好吗
That's the deal, right?

484
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:57,093
当然  珍妮  就这么定了
Sure, Jen, that's the deal.

485
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:02,068
我们一到证据保留室就给你电话
I'll call you when we get to the lockup.

486
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:06,051
好的
Okay.

487
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,045
你真苗条
You look thin.

488
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,078
请你出去一下
Be out in a minute.

489
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:54,062
我可不想久等
I don't want to wait that long.

490
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:59,026
拜托  瓦德米尔  让我先穿上衣服
Vladimir, please, just let me get dressed.

491
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,066
何必要多此一举
Why waste the energy?

492
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:03,023
反正过一会我又要把你脱光
I'll just have to get you undressed all over again.

493
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:10,077
听着  我告诉过你我不是来干这个的
Look, I already told you I didn't come here for this.

494
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:13,057
你是说过  但见我也是你来的原因之一吧
That's what you say, but part of you came here to see me.

495
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,067
承认吧
Admit it.

496
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,084
没什么好承认的
There's nothing to admit.

497
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:19,061
为什么那么不愿意承认事实呢
Why is it so hard for you to admit the truth?

498
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,095
你和我一样饥渴
You want this just as much as I do.

499
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:24,062
我不会再说一次了
I'm not going to tell you again.

500
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:27,002
让我先穿上衣服再说
Leave me alone and let me get dressed.

501
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,049
过来
Come here.

502
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:34,069
我叫你过来
I said come here.

503
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,030
要么过来要么滚出去
Come here or get out.

504
00:26:43,037 --> 00:26:46,017
我一个电话  这次交易就取消了
I call my men and the deal's off.

505
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:22,061
我... 我想先喝一杯
I'll, um... I'll take that drink now.

506
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:26,025
先把身子擦干
Dry yourself off.

507
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:27,088
准备好了就出来
Come out when you're ready.

508
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,003
蕾妮  听到了吗
Renee, do you copy?

509
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,043
是的  杰克
Yeah, Jack.

510
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,000
你没必要那么做
You don't have to do this.

511
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:48,023
我已经让一个小队待命了
I've got a team standing by.

512
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,060
我们现在就能把你救出来
We can get you out of there now.

513
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,084
那我们岂不是一筹莫展了
Where would that leave us?

514
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,064
我得继续潜伏下去
I've got to stay under.

515
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:56,062
我们再想其他办法
We'll find another way.

516
00:27:58,075 --> 00:28:00,069
没其他办法了
There is no other way.

517
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:05,092
蕾妮  别那么做
Renee, don't do this.

518
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,092
蕾妮
Renee...

519
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:08,012
去见瓦德的人吧
Go meet Vlad's men.

520
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:10,034
等你到这了  我会去见你
I'll see you when you get here.

521
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,071
你为什么不听我的劝
Why won't you listen to me?

522
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:12,068
我要关通讯器了
I'm going dark.

523
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:13,098
蕾妮  等...
Renee, wai...

524
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,003
这一系列拘捕给我国政府继续支持和平协议
These arrests are making it very difficult for my government to continue

525
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,030
造成了很大的阻碍
to support the peace agreement.

526
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:47,093
至于哈桑总统
President Hassan

527
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:49,090
很难忽视他的所作所为引起的反响
can't ignore the repercussions of what he's doing.

528
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:51,040
我了解哈桑总统
I know President Hassan.

529
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:53,074
他是个理性的人  是个好人
He is a rational man, a good man.

530
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,037
这些行为一定是事出有因
There must be a reason for these actions,

531
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:57,028
我说这话  不仅是作为他的代表
and I'm not just speaking as his delegate

532
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,048
也是作为他的朋友说的
but as his friend.

533
00:28:58,054 --> 00:28:59,098
作为他的朋友  你该让他知道
Well, as his friend, you need to let him know

534
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:03,068
不止我国政府怀有极大的忧虑
that my government is not the only one with grave concerns.

535
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,060
这次会谈正面临着分崩离析的危险
This conference is at risk of falling apart...

536
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,033
抱歉  打扰一下
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.

537
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,070
贾莫特先生  能和您私下说句话吗
Mr. Jamot, may I speak with you privately?

538
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,087
是的  当然可以
Yes, of course.

539
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:11,087
失陪了
Excuse me.

540
00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:12,087
没关系
Of course.

541
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,034
怎么了
What is it?

542
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:18,092
我接到命令  带您去大使馆回答些问题
I've been ordered to escort you to the embassy to answer some questions.

543
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,085
什么问题
Regarding?

544
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,042
国内治安问题
An internal security matter.

545
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:24,059
请跟我们走一趟
Please come with us.

546
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:27,029
我想要知道  这是怎么回事
Well, I-I would like to know what this is about.

547
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:29,006
到了大使馆我们会解释一切的  先生
We'll explain everything to you at the embassy, sir.

548
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:30,009
那就得过一阵了
Well, it will have to wait.

549
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:31,033
我正准备开个会
I am about to go into a meeting.

550
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,023
这事不能耽搁  先生
It cannot wait, sir.

551
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,032
我们现在就得动身
We need to go right now.

552
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:41,050
你这是想拘捕我吗
Are you arresting me?

553
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:45,091
我觉得慎重一些方为上策
It would be best if we kept this discreet.

554
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:48,054
这太过分了
This is outrageous.

555
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:50,005
我要和哈桑总统谈谈
I demand to speak with President Hassan.

556
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:53,018
就是哈桑总统下的命令
President Hassan is the one who gave this order.

557
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,059
我不会再客气地请你了
I will not ask you again.

558
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:57,079
跟我们走一趟吧
Come with us.

559
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:04,019
很好
Very well.

560
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:05,023
带他上车
Take him to the car.

561
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,030
我马上就过去
I'll be right there.

562
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:14,027
没事吧
Is everything all right?

563
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:15,041
一切正常  阁下
Everything is fine, sir.

564
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,067
失陪了
Please excuse me.

565
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:26,062
喂
Hello.

566
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:28,092
-是我  你身边没人吧  -没人
- It's me. Are you alone? - Yes.

567
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:30,063
怎么了  听起来你很不安
What's wrong? You sound upset.

568
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:32,019
我不希望你也背上包袱
I didn't want to burden you with this,

569
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:33,099
但我得和你谈谈你父亲的事
but I need to speak with you about your father.

570
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:37,055
怎么了
What is it?

571
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:39,031
我现在要去大使馆
I have to go to the embassy right now.

572
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:40,092
等我回来再私下见你
I'll meet you in private when I get back.

573
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:45,070
你每天要给他注射两次长春地辛
You're going to give him vindesine twice daily,

574
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,015
早晚各一次
morning and night.

575
00:30:47,015 --> 00:30:48,075
直接注射到输液包里
Inject it right into the I.V. Bag,

576
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:51,041
就像我现在这样
just like I'm doing.

577
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:53,041
你得小心点
You're going to want to be careful.

578
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:57,078
辐射中毒是会通过体液传播的
Radiation poisoning is transferable through bodily fluids.

579
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:59,052
你在听吗
Are you paying attention?

580
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,048
是  我知道了
Yes, I see.

581
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:04,082
他每隔一天需要用顺铂
He's also going to get cisplatin every other day,

582
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:06,039
但可以口服
but he can take that in pill form.

583
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,034
我先给你三周的量
I'm going to give you three weeks' worth.

584
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:10,097
我怎么能看出来他好转了没有
How will I know if he's getting better?

585
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:12,009
如果治疗有效  
If the treatment's working,

586
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:15,012
在七到十天内  他的症状会逐渐消退
his symptoms will begin to subside in seven to ten days.

587
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:20,000
我们很快就要走了
We're going to be leaving soon.

588
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,070
-去哪  -去郊区别墅那里
- Where? - To the country house.

589
00:31:21,077 --> 00:31:24,091
医生给了我治疗你的所有药物
The doctor's giving me everything I need to treat you.

590
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:26,061
你会好起来的  欧力格
You're going to get better, Oleg.

591
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:31,055
是护士带剩下的药物来了
That's the nurse with the rest of the medicine.

592
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,066
把武器放下  约瑟夫
Throw down your weapon, Josef.

593
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,044
照我说的做
Do what I said.

594
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,074
别自讨苦吃
Don't make this worse than it is.

595
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:01,019
放下枪
Drop it!

596
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:10,089
你个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

597
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,066
还有谁知道欧力格的病情
Who else knows about Oleg's sickness?

598
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:15,069
还有谁知道
Who else knows?

599
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:16,069
只有那个医生
Just the doctor.

600
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:17,069
确定吗
Are you sure?

601
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:18,069
确定
I'm sure.

602
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:19,083
拔掉他的输液管
Undo him.

603
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:25,037
等等  住手
Hey, wait, stop.

604
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:28,057
-你要干什么  -你爸派我们来带你们回家
- What are you doing? - Your father sent us to bring you home.

605
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:30,054
-现在就走  约瑟夫  -约瑟夫
- Now, Josef. - Josef...

606
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:31,094
没事的
It's okay.

607
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:33,021
照他说的做吧
Just do what he says.

608
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,011
我来扶他
I have him.

609
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:48,018
找到他们了
We found them.

610
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,011
他们在哪
Where were they?

611
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,083
弗农山的一间诊所
A clinic in Mount Vernon.

612
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,071
多少人知道欧力格的事
How many people found out about Oleg?

613
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,004
只有一个  一个医生
Only one... a doctor.

614
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:55,097
但我们已经摆平他了
but we've taken care of him.

615
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:57,027
没人知道我们来过
Nobody will know we were here.

616
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,040
很好
Good.

617
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:00,007
把我的儿子们带回来吧
Now, bring my sons to me.

618
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,037
了解
Da.

619
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,094
走吧
Let's go.

620
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,044
是迈尔吗
Meier?

621
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,050
没错
That's right.

622
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:37,021
你是德国来的
You are from Germany.

623
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:38,081
不莱梅
Bremen.

624
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:41,061
但我从小跟着我父亲旅行
But I grew up traveling with my father.

625
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:45,061
没去过  不过听说那里的女人很美
Never been there, but I hear the women are beautiful.

626
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:50,061
没错  可惜啊  我忙得没时间玩女人
You heard right. Unfortunately I am too busy working to enjoy them.

627
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,041
你有美国口音
You have American accent.

628
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:56,002
我在这上的大学  
I went to university here,

629
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:58,061
而且和我做生意的人大多说英语
and most of the people I do business with speak English.

630
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,086
估计说话就变味了
I guess it rubs off.

631
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:06,061
我们也许该说英语  德语太...
Maybe we should speak English, German is such a...

632
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,061
肮脏了
Dirty language.

633
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:11,061
你也不是干净人
And you are dirty people.

634
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:14,024
不过既来之则安之
But here we are.

635
00:34:14,024 --> 00:34:16,061
我们各取所需
We both need something from each other.

636
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:23,002
我们还要不要做交易了
Are we going to do business or not?

637
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:24,045
五百万美金在哪
Where is the $5 million?

638
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:26,063
我没和勒塔纳说上话之前你见不到一分钱
You don't see any money until I talk to Laitanan.

639
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,014
你有什么疑问的话
If you have questions,

640
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,050
问我吧
ask me.

641
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,097
我不想和你谈
I don't want to talk to you.

642
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:34,076
给他打电话  不然我就开车走人
Get him on the phone or I drive away.

643
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,040
现在就打
Now.

644
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:51,031
喂
Yes?

645
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:52,072
迈尔来了
Meier is here.

646
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:56,029
他说不先和你通话  就不会转账
He won't transfer the money until he speaks with you first.

647
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:58,079
把电话给他
Put him on.

648
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:04,056
我是迈尔
This is Meier.

649
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:05,093
是的  迈尔先生
Yes, Mr. Meier.

650
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,036
有什么问题吗
What's the problem?

651
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:09,027
在你收到钱之后
After you get your money,

652
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:11,047
还要多久我才能得到我要的消息
how long till I get my information?

653
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:13,009
不会很久  我只需要打几个电话
Not very long; I just have to make a few calls.

654
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,037
不会超过一个小时
No more than an hour.

655
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:15,094
蕾妮在哪
Where is Renee?

656
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,068
她很忙
She's busy.

657
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:19,061
我想和她谈谈
I would like to talk to her.

658
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:21,054
你来了就能见到她了
You can see her when you get here.

659
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:22,095
钱不到位
We have nothing more to discuss

660
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:24,001
我们就没什么好说的了
until the money's in place.

661
00:35:24,008 --> 00:35:25,038
把电话给卢戈
Now, get Lugo on the phone.

662
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,015
好吧
Fine.

663
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:34,076
说吧
Go ahead.

664
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,099
一旦确定钱到帐
Once the money is confirmed into our account,

665
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:38,033
你知道该怎么处理
you know what to do.

666
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,064
知道
Yes.

667
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,064
我要你的帐号
I need your account number.

668
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,033
我正进行多账户转账  
I'm transferring the money through multiple accounts

669
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:59,064
这样钱的来路就不会被追踪到  要花点时间
so it can't be traced. This will take a moment.

670
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:01,072
我们等着
We'll wait.

671
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,018
搞定了吗
Is it done?

672
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:19,031
还没
Not yet.

673
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,098
我的买家在钱方面的信誉不错  瓦德米尔
My partner's good for the money, Vladimir.

674
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:23,017
你该打电话找寻浓缩铀棒的下落了
You should be making calls, tracking down the rods.

675
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,060
我不会打电话的
I'm not going to make any calls,

676
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:27,050
因为我根本就没打算和你的买家做这笔买卖
'cause there isn't going to be any deal with your partner.

677
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:29,031
什么意思
What are you talking about?

678
00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:31,037
一旦我们拿到钱
Once we have the money...

679
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:33,029
交易结束
it's over.

680
00:36:33,038 --> 00:36:34,075
他就对我们毫无用处了
We don't need him anymore.

681
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:37,030
而我们就又多了五百万
And we'll be $5 million richer.

682
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:38,086
你这混蛋
You son of a bitch.

683
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:41,055
我可不会和贩卖核武器的人
I'm not about to get involved with the kind of people

684
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:42,087
搅合在一起
who traffic in nuclear arms.

685
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:44,067
瓦德米尔  听着  你不能这么做
Vladimir, listen, you can't do this.

686
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,029
怎么  这男人对你很重要吗
Why? This man mean something to you?

687
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:48,074
不是  我为了这桩买卖花了一年多时间
No, but I worked for more than a year to make this deal.

688
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:51,012
我可不会因为你没这胆子做就轻易放手
I'm not just gonna let it go because you don't have the guts to see it through.

689
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:52,010
这和胆子大不大无关
Hey, this isn't about guts.

690
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,037
这是关于是否是明智之举的问题
This is about being smart.

691
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,014
真的是这样吗 
Really?

692
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:57,014
难道一辈子做点小军火买卖就是明智的吗
Is it smart to keep selling small arms for the rest of your life?

693
00:36:57,026 --> 00:36:58,034
我给你找来千载难逢的好机会
I bring you the score of a lifetime,

694
00:36:58,044 --> 00:36:59,038
你就这样糟蹋了是吗
and you just piss it away?

695
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,098
就仅仅为了那五百万吗
For what- for $5 million?

696
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:02,054
那能够你挥霍多久呢
How long is that going to last you?

697
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:03,060
足够久了
Long enough.

698
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:05,079
你决不是一点小钱就能满足的主儿
You're more than all this.

699
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:07,040
我了解你
I know it.

700
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,058
所以我才找你来接这笔买卖
It's why I brought this deal to you.

701
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:16,021
我们能行的  一起大干一番
We can do this. Together.

702
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:19,046
一旦我们做成了这笔买卖就发财了
Once we've made the deal and we have the money,

703
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,028
我们就能在一起了
we can be together.

704
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:24,099
就可以重新开始了
We could start over.

705
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,070
不再受制于人了
Make our own moves.

706
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:32,070
所以我的买家还不能死
But I need my buyer. Alive.

707
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,040
抱歉
Sorry.

708
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:40,075
我意已决
This is the way I want it.

709
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:42,070
你以后会明白的  这是最明智的做法
You'll see. It's for the best.

710
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,035
你在干什么
What are you doing?

711
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:48,087
打电话
Making a call.

712
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,073
放下电话
Put down the phone.

713
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:53,091
我叫你放下电话
I said put it down!

714
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,087
永远不要和我对着干
Don't ever go against me!

715
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:03,050
事到如今你应该很明白这个道理了  蕾妮
Renee, you should know that by now.

716
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,080
听懂了吗
Okay?!

717
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,042
还有多久
How much longer?

718
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:31,077
马上就好了
It's almost done.

719
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:39,051
好了
There.

720
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,021
钱已到账
The money's in your account.

721
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,071
谢了  迈尔先生
Thank you, Mr. Meier.

722
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,005
放下武器  马上放下武器
Drop the weapon. Now! Drop it!

723
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:03,084
你真以为我能傻到一个人来交易吗
You really think I'm that stupid? That I'd come here alone?

724
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:06,048
给你的人打电话  快
Call your man. Do it!

725
00:39:10,006 --> 00:39:11,006
电话给我
Give me the phone.

726
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:18,007
我看到了  钱已到帐
I see we have the money.

727
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:19,044
迈尔死了没
Is Meier dead?

728
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,074
还没  你的三个手下已经被我杀了
Not exactly, but I've just taken out three of your men,

729
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:23,056
现在准备杀第四个
and I'm ready to take out the fourth.

730
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:27,046
你真以为你可以黑吃黑  得到这五百万吗
You really think you can roll me for $5 million?

731
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:29,045
蕾妮在哪
Where's Renee?

732
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,033
她就在这  她没事
She's right here. She's fine.

733
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:32,054
我需要证明
I want proof now!

734
00:39:34,092 --> 00:39:36,049
跟你的买家说句话
Say something to your partner.

735
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,024
迈尔  你还好吗
Meier, are you okay?

736
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:41,013
满意了吗
Satisfied?

737
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:44,042
蕾妮告诉我你准备将贵帮做大做强
Renee told me you were ready to take your organization to the next level.

738
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:45,087
很明显她看错人了
Apparently, she was wrong.

739
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,096
那也不一定  我很乐意重新考虑一下
Not necessarily. I'm willing to reconsider the situation.

740
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,015
你应该非常庆幸才对
The only thing you should consider yourself is lucky.

741
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:53,001
因为我现在仍然想做这笔买卖
And I still want this deal to happen.

742
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,040
否则你早就死了
Otherwise, you'd be dead.

743
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:56,082
如果你胆敢再耍花招  我们就开战了  
You try something like this again, we're going to war,

744
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:58,056
那恐怕是你最不愿意看到的局面
and that's the last thing you want.

745
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,011
把电话给我的人
Let me talk to my man.

746
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,044
好吧
Fine.

747
00:40:06,051 --> 00:40:07,052
喂
Yes?

748
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:09,098
把他带过来
Bring him back here.

749
00:40:10,023 --> 00:40:11,021
你确定吗
Are you sure?

750
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:12,085
对
Yeah.

751
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,098
他想要和你会面
He wants to see you.

752
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,079
站起来
Get up.

753
00:40:27,015 --> 00:40:28,068
你来开车
Move to the driver's-side door.

754
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:29,096
慢慢地走过去
Slowly.

755
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:40,049
上车
Get in.

756
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:51,083
我很抱歉  欧力格
I'm sorry, Oleg.

757
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,068
我不能眼睁睁看着他死
I couldn't let him die.

758
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,056
他可是我弟弟啊
He's my brother.

759
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:08,058
他还是我儿子呢
And he's my son.

760
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:11,047
你觉得他这样我心里好受吗
Do you think this is any easier for me?

761
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,008
他本来可以好起来的
It would've worked.

762
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:15,040
医生已经在治疗他了
The doctor was treating him.

763
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:17,012
你违抗了我的命令  约瑟夫 
You disobeyed me, Josef.

764
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:18,054
你让整个家族的安危命悬一线
You put this family at risk.

765
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:20,082
当您派人去诊所的时候  
You put this family at risk

766
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:22,028
才是让整个家族命悬一线  
when you sent those men into the clinic.

767
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:24,041
他们杀了三个人
They killed three people!

768
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:27,044
如果警察开始着手调查怎么办
What do you think's gonna happen when the police start to investigate?!

769
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:31,052
你翅膀硬了  敢质疑老子的判断力了吗
Who are you to question my judgment?

770
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:33,070
你是长子
You are my first-born.

771
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,099
在所有人中你最应该尊敬我
You, of all people, should give me respect.

772
00:41:36,014 --> 00:41:39,097
我一直很尊重您  但是这次您肯定错了
I do respect you. But this time you're wrong.

773
00:41:40,057 --> 00:41:43,039
医生说可以治愈欧力格的
The doctor said that Oleg could be treated.

774
00:41:43,078 --> 00:41:45,026
他都教我怎么做了
He showed me how!

775
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,042
我们只需要给他用药就行了
All we need is the medicine!

776
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,093
国有国法  帮有帮规  约瑟夫
There are rules, Josef.

777
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:53,096
规矩很简单
They are simple rules.

778
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:57,037
永远不要坏了规矩  
And they must never be broken!

779
00:41:57,076 --> 00:42:00,008
永远不威胁到家族的安危  永不
Never endanger the family; never.

780
00:42:00,078 --> 00:42:02,098
永远不要违抗你父亲的命令
And never disobey an order from your father.

781
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:05,090
爸爸
Papa...

782
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:07,043
不要  求您了
No, please,

783
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:10,086
这是你逼我的  约瑟夫
You made me do this, Josef.

784
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:13,096
求您了  不要
Please. Please don't.

785
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:19,036
儿子  对不住了
I'm sorry, my son.

786
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,023
站起来
Get up.

787
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,051
起来
Get up!

788
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:35,060
现在给格雷戈神父打电话
Now, call Father Gregor.

789
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:38,009
他会为欧力格祷告的
He'll pray over Oleg.

790
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:41,096
他完成祷告以后  自会厚葬你弟弟
When he's finished, we'll bury your brother.

791
00:42:48,096 --> 00:42:50,075
绝对不要再违抗我的命令
Never disobey me again.
