82
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:28,046
只要飞行员不知道他是冒充的
As long as the pilot thinks he's talking to one of us,

83
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,002
就会一直听他们指挥
He'll do whatever they tell him.

没错  我们更改了风向指标

安全局刚刚发现了

他们正布置入口标识  但并不乐观
They're trying to locate the point of entry, but they're not optimistic.

102
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,000
先别管他们怎么入侵的系统
Forget where they got into the system.

103
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,094
怎么才能把他们弄走
How the hell do we get them out?

104
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:21,018
不知道  以前从没发生过
they don't know. They've never seen anything like this before.

105
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:24,051

希望你查到schector的消息了

109
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,095
这事闹大了
This thing has escalated.

110
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:34,019
闹大了  什么意思

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,042
阿尔梅达挑了一架767飞机

113
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,073
什么  为什么  要飞到哪儿

114
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:40,026
不知道  不过必须要找到他
I don't know, but we've got to find this guy.

115
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:41,086
谢克特怎么说
What did schector say?

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,076
被杀之前没说什么
Not much before he was killed.

117
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:45,007
什么
What?

118
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:48,024
我们立刻封锁了大楼  他就在那儿
We sealed off the building immediately; we know he's in there.

119

我觉得你有麻烦了
I think you got a problem.

125
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,008
谢克特死了才几秒钟
Almeida called that office seconds

126
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,035
阿尔梅达就打电话到办公室
after schector was killed.

127
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,078
他怎么会知道我在那里的
How do you think he knew I was there?

128
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,005
我想他被监视了吧
I'm assuming he had him under watch.

129
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,059
我认为是你办公室的问题
I think it came from your office.

130
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,006
-什么    -联调局内部人泄的密
What? someone from inside the fbi had to tip him off.

131
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,083
只有他们知道我和你一起来的
They were the only people who knew I was going with you.

132
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:13,076
不  我不相信
No, I can't believe that.

133
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:16,023
我也不想相信托尼是恐怖分子
Yeah, and I didn't want to believe tony almeida was a terrorist,

134
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,015
不过我们都要面对事实
But at some point we have to deal with the facts,

135
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,075
我们不想相信的  是事实
Not what we want to believe is true. look, jack, I read your file.

136
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:20,093
杰克  我看过你的档案
look, jack, I read your file.

137
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:22,052
我知道你有多疑的倾向
I know you have a propensity for not trusting people,

138
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:23,074
不过  我的人一直在很努力的
But my team has been working around the

139
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:25,034
找出阿尔梅达  他们是好样的
Clock to find almeida; they are all good agents.

140
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:28,004
房顶上的狙击手怎么回事  说啊
Explain to me how they got a sniper on the roof that quickly.

141
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,028
我告诉你  阿尔梅达监视了谢克特
I told you, almeida had schector staked out.

142
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,095
我们在谢克特的办公室才10分钟
We were in schector's office for ten minutes.

143
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:34,041
他们没法在这么短的时间内派狙击手来
There is no way they got a shooter in position that fast.

144
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,016
从现在起  除非你知道哪里出了问题
Now, until you know where the leak is,

145
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,038
不然你就得假定有内鬼
You have to assume that you've got a bad agent,

146
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,009
并且做好防范措施
And you need to work around him.

147
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,087
杰克  我让你来是帮助处理谢克特的事情
No offense, jack, but I brought you here to help with schector,

148
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,046
而不是来指手划脚的
Not to co-manage this operation.

149
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:46,096
你带我来是为了帮你找出阿尔梅达
You brought me here to help you find almeida.

150
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,063
我要再强调一下你得小心内鬼
And I am warning you, you better be careful who you let in.

151
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:51,094
鲍尔先生  请把枪交出来
Mr. bauer, I need you to surrender the gun.

152
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:02,064
基尔纳探员
Agent kilner...

153
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:04,084
在我回来之前把杰克·鲍尔关到你车里
Jack bauer, put him in your vehicle till I get back.

154
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,085
好的
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:07,016
这边请
This way, sir.

156
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,059
情况如何
What's your status?

157
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,023
我们把这包围了  一只鸟也飞不出去
We secured the building; all exits are covered.

158
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:21,022
等特警组一过来
When swat team gets here,

159
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:24,003
在卫星侦测的帮助下  我们就一间间屋子的搜
We'll have video feed and we'll sweep the building room by room.

160
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:26,003
如果狙击手还在这  他铁定跑不掉
If the shooter's in there, we'll find him.

161
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:28,034
他就在这
He's in there.

162
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:46,089
詹尼斯   把你从联邦航空局那得到的资料都转给西恩
Janis, whatever you've got on faa, leave it with to sean.

163
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,099
-你过来下  -等等  这儿还需要她
- Come here. - Wait a minute. I need her here.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,033
我更需要
So do i.

165
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,036
刚在谢克特的办公室里
There was sniper fire at schector's office.

166
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:56,060
-三个人被狙击手给枪杀了  - 蕾妮不是在那吗?
- We've got three dead bodies. - Where renee was?

167
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,083
-没错  -她还好吧
- Yeah. - Is she okay?

168
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,073
她没事  听着  我需要你给他们提供支援
She's fine. listen, I need you to provide support.

169
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:01,067
蕾妮认为狙击手就在哥伦比亚大楼里
Renee thinks she has the sniper locked in the columbia building.

170
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:03,034
特警组在路上  和他们一起把事情搞定
There are swat teams on the way; coordinate with them. okay.

171
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:06,031
国家安全局想出和那架飞机联系上的方法了吗
Anything else from nsa on how we get through to that plane?

172
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:08,047
没  据一个和拉森曾经合作过的专家说
No, but we talked to one of the men who worked with latham,

173
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:10,061
由系统遭受入侵的方式判断
Who said that based on the way the firewall was breeched,

174
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,022
他不认为我们能够成功联系上那架飞机
He doesn't think we can contact.

175
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:20,079
你好  我是莫斯探员
Yeah, it's agent moss.

176
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,006
怎么样  有什么招吗
Hey, got any help for us?

177
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,039
不要指望国家安全局了  你那边什么情况
Nsa's nowhere. what about you?

178
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,009
我们试图联系飞机上的乘客
We're trying to contact passengers.

179
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,003
但目前为止还不行
So far we haven't been able to get through to anyone.

180
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:29,036
空军那边的情况如何
What about air force?

181
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:31,033
他们紧急起飞了一架F16战机进行拦截
They've scrambled an f-16 to intercept,

182
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,037
但离它还差13分钟
But it's still about 13 minutes out.

183
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:35,007
好  那等会再和你联系
Look, let me get back to you. yeah.

184
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:37,037
兄弟们  有没有办法破坏他们的通讯
Gus, have you been able to break into their channel yet?

185
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,071
不行  不过我可以清楚地听阿尔梅达和飞行员的谈话
No, but I can hear almeida talking with the pilot.

186
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:41,077
他指示飞机降落在左31号跑道上
He's landing him on runway three-one-left.

187
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:44,044
事情不可能这么简单的
It can't be that simple.

188
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:47,017
他们不会费这么大的劲就仅仅为了
These people didn't take control of this plane

189
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:50,008
让飞行降落到一条不同的跑道上
Just so they can land it on a different runway.

190
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,066
托德 你的雷达有没有发现进港飞机的异常
Todd, what do you got on your radar that's on approach?

191
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:55,076
一切正常
Everything looks good.

192
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,012
你的GSA 117怎么样了
And gsa 117?

193
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,063
没有飞行器靠近它
Nothing near it.

194
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,096
这是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is this?!

195
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:03,023
出什么事了
What happened?

196
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,043
东部区域的所有屏幕都被锁定了
All the screens for the eastern quadrant are locked.

197
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:07,008
备用系统怎么样了
Try the backup systems.

198
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,010
托德  它们停止工作了
They're not working. todd!

199
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,091
-它被锁定了  -我的也是
- It's locked! - mine, too.

200
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:15,031
好  现在他们成了瞎子了
Okay, they're blind.

201
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:17,048
不错
All right...

202
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:21,045
让东边的那架飞机的飞行航线撞上117航班
Send their sunrise flight into an intersecting landing pattern with 117.

203
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:25,056
Sri35航班  这是东北三号
Sri35, this is northeast three control.

204
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:30,033
你被指定了一条新的降落跑道
We have a new runway assignment for you.

205
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,009
请在右4号跑道降落
Runway four-right.

206
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,057
明白  东北三号
Roger that, northeast three.

207
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,081
他正在改变航线
He's changing course.

208
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,028
保罗森
Paulson.

209
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,061
你的屏幕是不是都不动了
How do your screens look over there?

210
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,061
-你是谁  -这无关紧要
-Who is this? -that doesn't matter.

211
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:57,026
关键是我已经把你的空管权弄到手了
What matters is that I took out your control units.

212
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,065
让CTU赶快追踪这个呼叫
Call the bureau. trace this call.

213
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:00,089
你究竟想干什么
What the hell do you want?

214
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,099
让你看看我们能够做些什么
I want you to see what we can do.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,094
你不妨打开JFK机场控制塔上的摄像头看看
Why don't you pull up the surveillance cameras at jfk tower.

216
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,084
把JFK机场摄像头给我打开
Give me the cameras at jfk.

217
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,074
糟糕  右四跑道上有一架飞机正在降落
Sid, there's another plane landing on four-right.

218
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:18,074
它正好穿过左13跑道
It crosses three-one-left.

219
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:21,017
我的上帝  它们会撞上的
Oh, my god, they're on a collision course.

220
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,052
马上让JFK机场进入紧急状态
Scramble emergency at jfk.

221
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:48,007
GSA 117  请拉升
Gsa 117, pull up.

222
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:50,017
紧急情况  马上拉升
Safety alert, pull up.

223
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:53,018
右四跑道上有飞机降落  立刻拉升
Traffic on runway four-right. pull up.

224
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:12,002
头  屏幕和通讯都恢复正常了
Sir, we have screens and communication back.

225
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,026
菲力浦  你情况如何
Phil...

226
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:15,080
一切恢复正常
We're good.

227
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:20,090
刚才不过是一个警告
That was just a warning shot.

228
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:23,080
下一次就不再是为了显示我们的能力
Whatever we do next will not be a demonstration.

229
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,057
我们会来真格的
It'll be the real thing.

230
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,011
你们想要什么
What do you people want?

231
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:29,042
你很快就会知道了
You'll find out soon enough.

232
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,029
爱默生来了
Emerson's here.

233
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,060
把仪器准备好
Get the module ready.

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,031
把他的手铐解开
Uncuff him.

235
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:44,044
那些飞机怎么了
What happened to those planes?

236
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:46,010
不关你的事
Don't worry about that.

237
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,004
你是不是把它们撞毁了
Did you crash them?

238
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,098
你杀了多少人
How many people did you kill?

239
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,026
把他弄干净
Get him cleaned up.

240
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,089
-你好  托尼  -你好  戴维
- Hey, tony. - david.

241
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,013
计划进行得很顺利
I take it everything went as planned.

242
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:14,040
是
Yeah.

243
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,030
我们的仪器已经顺利通过测试
The off-site testing the module worked perfectly.

244
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:18,088
让我看看
Let's see it.

245
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,049
不错
Good.

246
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:33,045
那就是我们的天才工程师
That's our genius, huh?

247
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:35,042
是的
Yes, it is.

248
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:37,026
他看上去有点不听话
Had to be encouraged?

249
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,029
有那么点  不过
Yeah, but...

250
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,086
我已经把他给收拾得服服贴贴
I've got him to a place where he'll do whatever you want.

251
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:42,069
有空单独聊几句
Can I talk to you a second?

252
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,040
把仪器拿走
Take the module.

253
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:50,097
告诉我FBI是怎么找到谢克特的
So, tell me how the fbi managed to find schector.

254
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:53,097
他们利用了我以前的一位同事
They used an old colleague of mine.

255
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:56,034
我曾经在CTU一起工作的杰克·鲍尔
An agent I worked with at ctu named jack bauer.

256
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:58,061
我知道他是谁
Yeah, I know who bauer is.

257
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:00,065
嗯  不过他不是问题
Yeah, well, he's not going to be a problem.

258
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,058
我没让FBI从谢克特嘴里掏出任何东西
I took care of schector before he could tell the fbi anything.

259
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:05,062
我也会搞定杰克·鲍尔的
I'll take care of jack bauer, too.

260
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:08,035
我不希望你在新的任务上分心
I don't want you distracted from this new job.

261
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:10,082
新的任务究竟是什么
Speaking of which, you haven't told me what that is.

262
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,092
坦纳有关于任务的详细情况
Tanner has the specs.

263
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:14,002
等他到了你自然就明白了
He'll brief you when he gets here.

264
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,013
你为什么现在不告诉我
Why don't you just tell me now?

265
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,083
你现在还不需要知道
'cause you don't need to know yet.

266
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:21,063
托尼  我们一起合作三年了
Tony, we've been doing this three years.

267
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:25,017
知道秘密的人越少  大家就越安全
The less information any one of us has, the safer we all are.

268
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:29,007
振作点  干完这次  我们就洗手不干了
Come on, after this next job, we're done.

269
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,058
把钱赚够  以后就随心所欲了
Cash in our chips, do whatever we want.

270
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:34,014
那好
All right.

271
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:36,018
坦纳到了我再联系你
I'll call you when tanner gets here.

272
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,088
好
Okay.

273
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,068
走人
Let's go.

274
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,042
快点  出发
Come on, let's go.

275
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:44,029
长官  我即将要宣读一份声明
I'm about to make a statement, sir.

276
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,096
有我应该知晓的变化么
Are there any changes I should know about?

277
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:47,073
不  没有
No, this is fine.

278
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:51,098
只是要记住  不管他们怎么逼你
Just remember, don't indicate when the go-ahead to invade will be given,

279
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,090
别暗示出下达命令
No matter how hard they push.

280
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:55,032
但是提及总统在会见前总理马托波
But it's acceptable to mention that the

281
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,044
是可以接受的吧
President is meeting with former prime minister matobo?

282
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:01,067
是的  而且当他们问及总统是否认为他是朱玛的继任者的时候
Yes. and when they ask whether the president sees him as juma's successor?

283
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:03,067
没必要隐瞒
No need to hide that fact.

284
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:07,004
在支持马托波这方面  总统想要最大的曝光
President wants maximum exposure on her support for matobo.

285
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,032
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

286
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,012
女士们先生们  早上好
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

287
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:22,051
尽管全世界进行了谴责  联合国也进行了强制性经济制裁
Despite global condemnation and un-imposed economic sanctions,

288
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:26,081
本杰明·朱玛将军还是拒绝停止他的种族灭绝
General benjamin juma has refused to stop the genocide that

289
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:31,077
从他掌管政权以来  他就进行了的野蛮独裁政策
His brutal dictatorship has been perpetrating since he took power.

290
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,026
泰勒总统已经说服世界上很多国家
President taylor has made a persuasive case to the world that

291
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:38,093
我们将会实施一个全面的军事干预
A full-scale military intervention by us forces and a complete

292
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:42,053
这也是唯一的方法来彻底推翻朱玛的政权
Overthrow of the juma regime would be the only way to stop the

293
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:46,078
以此来阻止他继续屠杀无辜的桑加拉的人民
Continued slaughter of the innocent men, women and children of sangala.

294
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,012
好  那边那位
Yes, you there.

295
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,069
安吉拉  总统已经制定了干预的时间表了么
Angela, has the president formulated a time frame for this intervention?

296
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,099
喂
Hello.

297
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,093
长官  航管局刚报告在肯尼迪机场  两架飞机差点相撞
Sir, the faa just reported a near-collision at jfk.

298
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,053
肯尼迪机场
Jfk?

299
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:59,053
-是的  长官  -多长时间以前
-Yes, sir. -how long ago did this happen?

300
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:03,022
我可以告诉你  总统现在就在和前总理马托波商谈
I can tell you that president taylor and former prime minister ule

301
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:07,045
以制定进兵后的策略
Matobo are meeting as we speak to formulate a post-invasion strategy.

302
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:10,064
我知道你做出了很大的努力
I know how hard you fought to get the

303
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:13,081
才能为这次军事行动得到支持
Support needed to launch this military operation.

304
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:17,045
而且我要告诉您  我们的国家会永远感激您
And I want you to know my country will be eternally grateful.

305
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:20,035
我们的士兵才是你应该感谢的
Our soldiers are the ones truly deserving of your gratitude.

306
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:23,029
他们才命悬一线的人
They're the people putting their lives on the line.

307
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,096
尽管如此  我了解你冒了很大的政治风险
Still, I know you are taking a great political risk.

308
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:27,079
我没有保留的余地
I have no reservations.

309
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,093
阻止朱玛是正义的事情
Stopping juma is the right thing to do.

310
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,059
但是当他的政权被推翻的时候
But once he's been removed from power,

311
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,077
得到正当法律的制裁是很关键的
It is critical that he be dealt with in a court of law.

312
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,060
不能让人们留下以暴制暴的印象
And not in a way that would perpetuate the cycle of violence.

313
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:43,021
朱玛已经杀了我们二十万人民
Juma has killed over 200,000 of our people,

314
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:45,044
包括我的两个兄弟
Including two of my own brothers.

315
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,095
没人比我更了解以暴制暴的恶性循环了
So no one knows more about the "cycle of violence" Than I do.

316
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:52,038
但是我的同胞想看到朱玛被惩罚
But my countrymen will want to see juma punished.

317
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,005
那就依法惩处
Then punish him according to the rule of law.

318
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:59,049
那样你才能在桑加拉推行民主
That's the only way democracy will work in sangala.

319
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,049
如果每个人都依法处置
If no one is treated outside the law.

320
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,084
朱玛也不例外
Not even juma.

321
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:15,058
我向你保证
You have my word.

322
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,013
现在
And now,

323
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,030
我要去见国防部长
I'd like for us to go over some last-minute

324
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:26,085
重新看一遍我们的最终行动计划
Operational points with my secretary of defense.

325
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,096
好的
All right.

326
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,060
失陪 马托波先生
Excuse me, mr. matobo.

327
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:38,003
有什么紧急情况  伊桑
What's the emergency, ethan?

328
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:40,033
东北航管刚报告说
Northeast air traffic control just reported a

329
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:42,090
肯尼迪机场两架客机差点相撞
Near-miss between two commercial flights at jfk.

330
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:44,090
幸运的是  没有人员伤亡
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

331
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:47,004
认为幕后黑手是阿尔梅达
And we think this man almeida was behind it?

332
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,011
是他
It's him.

333
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:49,061
我们证实了他的语音印迹
We verified his voice print.

334
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:52,035
他跟航管通过话  并告诉他们
He contacted air traffic control and told them this

335
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:55,048
这只是个警告  可以说是大餐前的小开胃菜
Was a demonstration; a shot across the bow, so to speak.

336
00:16:55,049 --> 00:17:02,039
-他要干什么  -他的原话是"你们很快就会知道了"
-What does he want? his exact words were "you'll find out soon enough."

337
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:05,029
不敢相信
Oh, this is unacceptable.

338
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,029
我的意思是这都是技术问题吗
I mean, it's just technology.

339
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,029
我们应该可以除掉这些混蛋的
We should be able to unplug these bastards.

340
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,040
能想到的我们都试过了  事情没那么简单
Well, we're trying everything we can think of, but it's not that simple.

341
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,080
在找到阿尔梅达上  都做了些什么
What's being done to find almeida?

342
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:17,007
联调局认为他们跟以前的一个同事关系密切
The fbi believes they're closing in on one of his associates.

343
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:18,014
他们的时间表是什么
What's their time frame?

344
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:20,014
还不清楚
That's unclear.

345
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:23,005
别管那些不重要的空中交通了
Let's go ahead with grounding all nonessential air traffic,

346
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:25,068
安排一个跟国安局 联调局 国防部的会议
And set up a meeting with homeland, fbi, and dod.

347
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,085
好的  总统女士
Yes, madam president.

348
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:30,062
说
Yeah.

349
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,022
是谁
Who is it?

350
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:36,010
等下  是坦纳
Hold on. tanner.

351
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:41,086
喂  坦纳  发生什么了
Hey, tanner, what's going on?

352
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:45,003
我被困在哥伦比亚大楼了
I'm trapped in the columbia building.

353
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:47,000
联调局的人正一层一层的搜查
Fbi's sweeping it right now, floor by floor.

354
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,060
我不知道怎么才能甩掉他们
I don't know how the hell I'll be able to get past them.

355
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:50,070
我明白
I understand.

356
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:52,024
你具体在大厦的什么位置
Exactly where in the building are you?

357
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,050
地下室
The basement.

358
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:57,002
靠近西楼梯井
Near the west stairwell.

359
00:17:58,082 --> 00:18:00,041
我们在12楼
We're on 12th.

360
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,088
收到  第一小组
Roger that, alpha.

361
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,021
第六层检查完毕  我们撤离
Sixth floor's clear. we're moving.

362
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:06,055
收到  第三小组  去搜查第五层
Copy that. charlie two, moving to the fifth floor.

363
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:08,016
前进
Proceed.

364
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:13,026
鲍尔先生
Mr. bauer?

365
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:15,037
是
Yeah?

366
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:18,085
我只是想告诉你  在参议院听证会上
I just wanted to tell you-- what they're making

367
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:22,011
他们那样对待你是不对的
You go through at that senate hearing, it's wrong.

368
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:26,015
没有啦
No, it's not.

369
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:30,057
把所有的事情都公布出来更好一些
It's better that everything comes out in the open.

370
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:36,065
这些年  我们以保护这个国家和人民的名义
We've done so many secret things over the years in the name of

371
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:43,039
做了许多秘密的事情
Protecting this country ours and the people we promised to protect.

372
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,006
国家和人民有权利知道事实真相
They deserve to know the truth.

373
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,089
那样他们就可以决定  他们想让我们走多远
Then they can decide how far they want to let us go.

374
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,049
尽管这样  那样对你也是不厚道的
Still, you don't deserve to be treated that way,

375
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,024
毕竟你为这个国家做了很多事情
Not after what you've done for our country.

376
00:18:57,088 --> 00:19:00,001
而且不止我一个人这么想
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.

377
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:04,005
谢谢你
Thank you.

378
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:20,069
从西楼梯井进入地下室
Entering the basement from the west stairwell.

379
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,050
收到  兰纳德探员
Roger that, agent lennert.

380
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:58,013
我是来救你出去的
I'm here to get you out.

381
00:19:58,014 --> 00:20:00,013
托尼派我来的
Tony sent me.

382
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:02,088
怎么出去
How?

383
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:07,010
把这个穿上
Put this on.

384
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:10,024
一个特警组小组刚检查过楼梯井
A swat unit just cleared the stairwell.

385
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:12,008
沿着它上到大厅
Take it up to the lobby.

386
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,076
有辆灰色福特
There's a gray ford parked next to

387
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:18,015
停在大厦后面空地上的电话亭边
The kiosk in the lot behind the building.

388
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,023
快走
Go.

389
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,049
这里是兰纳德
This is lennert.

390
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,076
-地下室检查完毕  -收到
-Basement level is clear. -roger that.

391
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:31,043
第一小组在搜查一层  你可以跟他们对接
Alpha team is clearing the first floor. you can hook up with them.

392
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:33,036
马上
On my way.

393
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:35,063
沃克 探员  她很厉害是吧
Agent walker, she's good, huh?

394
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,060
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

395
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:40,058
她明白怎样才能把工作做好
She understands what it takes to get the job done.

396
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:44,084
我可以去车外呼吸点新鲜空气么
You mind if I step out and get some air?

397
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,081
这一大早上都很闷
It's been a hell of a morning.

398
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:48,055
当然可以
Yeah, sure thing.

399
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,088
别走远  先生
Just stay close, sir.

400
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,095
好
Yeah.

401
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:52,026
谢谢你
Thanks.

402
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,070
刚从总部得知
Just got an update from headquarters.

403
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:06,080
你朋友  托尼·阿尔梅达
Your friend, tony almeida,

404
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:09,090
利用仪器精心策划了一起事件  至使两飞机差点相撞
Just used the device to orchestrate a near-miss between two planes.

405
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:13,018
他还威胁说下次会玩真的
He's threatening to do it for real next time.

406
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,051
你手下都是统一服装的么
Are all your men represented on the deployment grid?

407
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,088
是啊  怎么了
Yeah. why?

408
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:23,001
不要轻举妄动  看见走开的那个人了吗
I don't want you to do anything now, but see that man walking away?

409
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,011
他就是狙击手
That's your shooter.

410
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:26,022
怎么会这样
How can that be possible?

411
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,022
你的人帮他走出了警戒线
If one of your people helped him get through the perimeter.

412
00:21:28,023 --> 00:21:30,053
查一下
Check the grid.

413
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,053
让开
Look out.

414
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:38,060
没错  他不是我们的人
You're right. he's not one of ours.

415
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:41,033
我们跟踪他  看看能不能带我们找到托尼·阿尔梅达
We'll follow him, see if he leads us back to almeida-- dornan.

416
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:43,020
不  这样做不对
No, that's not the right move.

417
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:45,027
不知道局里做了多少让步之前
You can't bring anyone else into this,

418
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:48,074
不能让其他人牵扯进来
Not until you know how badly the bureau's been compromised.

419
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,097
好  那你说怎么做
Okay, so what are you suggesting?

420
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:51,071
我们自己来
We can do this on our own.

421
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:54,095
沃克探员
Yes, agent walker?

422
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,015
长官
Ma'am?

423
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,095
在大楼东边安排更多警力
Put more agents on the eastern edge of the building.

424
00:21:58,096 --> 00:22:00,012
看上去警力不足
The perimeter looks light.

425
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:01,035
好的
On it.

426
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:03,019
-做得对  -走着瞧
You made the right call. we'll see.

427
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,083
我要用你的车
I need your vehicle.

428
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,023
现在插播一条新闻
We have some breaking news to tell you about right now.

429
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:37,004
经联邦航空局确认  不久前在肯尼迪机场
The faa confirms a near-miss between two planes

430
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:40,059
两架航班险些相撞
At jfk international airport just a short time ago.

431
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,016
因此所有即将离港航班将停留待命
As a result, outgoing flights nationwide are now grounded.

432
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:47,006
已经升空的飞机将在下个航点停靠
Planes already in the air will be grounded once they land.

433
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:48,066
听着  拉森
The faa... listen to me, latham.

434
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,053
照之前说得做  才能保命
Do as you're told, you'll stay alive.

435
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:52,034
明白吗
You understand?

436
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,038
把他关到储藏室去  看住了
Put him in storage. watch him.

437
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:04,029
杜巴库先生  这个威胁很不错吧
an effective demonstration, wouldn't you say, mr. dubaku?

438
00:23:05,023 --> 00:23:07,062
非常有效
Very effective.

439
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:10,005
朱玛上校会对此很满意的
General juma will be pleased.

440
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:12,089
就是那个仪器吗
Is that the module?

441
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,036
按要求设计的
As promised.

442
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:16,058
为了以防万一  我把设计者也带来了
And I've brought the man who constructed it

443
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:19,033
以便在有必要的情况下进行修正
Here in case there are any modifications necessary.

444
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:22,098
如此一来  足以向白宫方面证实我们的实力了  杜巴库先生
Well, now that we've impressed upon the white house what we can do, mr.Dubaku

445
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:24,073
或许该是时候让泰勒总统知道
Perhaps now would be a good time to

446
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:27,007
你们需要的是什么东西了
Make your demands known to president taylor.

447
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:30,032
准备一下
Make the preparations.

448
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:34,081
你们的政府不仅杀了我哥哥  还想来杀我
Your government killed my brother and they tried to kill me.

449
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:37,092
现在他们将付出巨额的罚金
Now they are going to pay a very steep price for...

450
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:41,056
涉足我们的私事
...interfering in our affairs.

451
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:46,034
联邦航空局正在降落航班  目前为止平安无事
Faa is landing flights, so far without incident,

452
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:49,030
不过照之前他们的行事习惯  在任何时候都有可能
But these people have proven what they can do, and at any time,

453
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:51,015
破坏空中交通或者
Can sabotage air traffic or any of the

454
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:53,076
我们现有的基础设施  已经越过了防火墙
Infrastructure systems we have beyond the firewall.

455
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:56,010
在修复工作上  国家安全局有时间计划吗
Does nsa have a timeframe on fixing it

456
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:58,094
这样才是长久之计
So we can keep these people out permanently?

457
00:23:58,095 --> 00:24:01,070
总统夫人  CIP是多年积累的工程项目
Madame president, the cip firewall was the result of a multi-year project.

458
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:03,084
重新设计代码需要几周甚至几月的时间
Reengineering the code could take weeks or months.

459
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:06,038
也就是说  国家安全局也不清楚
At this point, nsa just doesn't know.

460
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,015
确切点说哪类体系易受攻击  科尔内先生
Exactly what systems are vulnerable, dr. cornell?

461
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:12,078
首当其冲的应是国家电网
At the top of the list would be the national power grid.

462
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,029
一旦瘫痪
If disabled,

463
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,085
将不可能为数百万人的供应电力
We could end up being unable to deliver power to many millions of people.

464
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:18,052
大规模的灯火管制将
A blackout of that scale would almost

465
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:20,079
导致大城市的骚乱
Certainly result in rioting in the major cities.

466
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,006
比之更为严重的是水处理和传输系统
Even more critical are the water treatment and distribution systems.

467
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,034
通过破坏关键的大坝和污水处理厂
By sabotaging key dams and sewage processing plants,

468
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:30,003
甚至大规模的污染饮用水
They could contaminate drinking water on a massive scale.

469
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:33,095
由此而导致的中毒致死将是空前绝后的
Deaths from poisoning would be substantial up front and massive

470
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,040
随之而来的
Casualties would follow soon thereafter

471
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,004
将是更多的人由于脱水而致死
As people began to die from dehydration.

472
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,088
有办法保护这些系统吗
Is there any way to protect these systems?

473
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:43,077
唯一的办法就是在短时间内将其关闭
The only way would be shutting them down, and then, within a short time,

474
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:45,027
如此一来  不能给人们提供
It would be impossible to supply the

475
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:47,038
充足的事物和干净的水
Population with sufficient food and clean water.

476
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,035
这样做的结果就是加剧了社会的动荡局面
The resulting civil unrest would undoubtedly aggravate the situation.

477
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:54,037
这是最新的预测报告
Here are the latest projections.

478
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,051
谢谢
Thank you.

479
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:10,054
伊桑·卡宁
Ethan kanin.

480
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,064
卡宁先生
Mr. kanin

481
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:13,084
我跟第一先生在一起
I'm with the first gentleman.

482
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:15,001
你和他在哪里
With him where?

483
00:25:15,002 --> 00:25:16,015
他在干什么
What's he doing?

484
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,052
泰勒先生正在去见他前任女友罗杰的路上
Mr. taylor is on his way to confront roger's former girlfriend.

485
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:21,089
我还以为他放弃了
I thought he gave up on all of this.

486
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,096
长官  儿子被谋杀这事儿已经把他消耗殆尽了
Sir, he's consumed by the idea that his son was murdered,

487
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:24,098
在过去的两个月里
And for the past two months,

488
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:26,082
他一直在以私人名义雇用侦探
He's been pursuing that belief through a private

489
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,096
调查这件事
Detective he hired without the president's knowledge.

490
00:25:28,097 --> 00:25:30,096
上帝啊
My god.

491
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:35,003
为什么我刚刚才知道这件事
Why is this the first time I'm hearing anything about this?

492
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:37,015
我为此负责  长官
I take full responsibility for that, sir.

493
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:41,014
泰勒先生用我来保证他的活动远离官方途径
Mr. Taylor enlisted me in keeping his activities off the official manifest,

494
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:43,021
不过   情况有点失控
But, uh, it's gotten out of hand.

495
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,081
就这点来说  我很担心泰勒先生的
And at this point, I'm worried about mr. taylor's...

496
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:47,051
心态
State of mind.

497
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:50,025
我认为总统有必要知道这边发生了什么
I think the president needs to know what's going on.

498
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,055
好吧
All right.

499
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:53,086
谢谢你   盖齐探员
Thank you, agent gedge.

500
00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:59,042
盖齐探员
Agent gedge?

501
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,069
在  先生
Sir?

502
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,089
没什么问题吧
Everything all right?

503
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,069
是的先生  办个手续而已
Yes, sir. just checking in.

504
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,073
灾难前的准备工作还不够妥当
Building disaster preparedness scenarios is not enough.

505
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:10,030
我希望负责人能把
I want the governors to put the

506
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:12,060
国民警卫队安排在预先部署的地方
National guard on a pre-deployment footing.

507
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:15,027
直到我们找出幕后黑手
And until we find and stop the people behind this,

508
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:18,034
我觉得有必要提升警报等级
I think we should talk about raising the alert level.

509
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,009
是的  长官  我们已经把那栋建筑戒严了
Yes, sir, we have the building locked down,

510
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,025
同时我们正在搜捕之前提到的嫌犯
And we're searching for the suspect as we speak.

511
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:23,078
这已经是最高优先级了  长官
It's our highest priority, sir.

512
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,032
明白  长官
Understood, sir.

513
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,005
白宫上下都在关注这个
The white house is all over this.

514
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:29,022
国土安全局更依赖我们
Homeland's leaning on us.

515
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:30,045
我们现在去找那家伙
We have got to find this guy now.

516
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,053
多曼的小队已经完成了对大楼的第一轮搜捕
Dornan's team is almost done with their first sweep through the building,

517
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:36,046
但他说凭直觉那狙击手根本不在那里
But he said it's his gut feeling that the sniper is not in there.

518
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,086
我可不管他什么直觉
I don't care about his gut feeling.

519
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:39,002
蕾妮说他们在
Renee said they had that building

520
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:40,070
枪响之后就立刻对大楼进行了戒严
Locked down right after the shots were fired.

521
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:42,003
他肯定在那里
He's got to be in there.

522
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:44,017
-遵命  长官  -让他们不要放过任何角落
Yes, sir. tell them to search every square inch.

523
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:45,037
-呃...  -还有什么事
Uh, uh, uh... what?

524
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,011
多曼也想知道我们有没有沃克探员的下落
Dornan also wants to know if we know where agent walker is.

525
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:51,034
她不在那里吗
She's not at the scene?

526
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:56,015
十分钟前她没登记就走了
She left ten minutes ago without logging her destination.

527
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:58,008
鲍尔呢
What about bauer?

528
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:00,002
他也一起走了
He left the scene with her.

529
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:21,067
前面堵车了
He's coming up on heavy traffic.

530
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:23,027
你可以开慢点
You can drop back a little more.

531
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:24,092
没关系  我看着他呢
It's all right. I've got him.

532
00:27:26,075 --> 00:27:29,008
是拉里
It's larry.

533
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:30,045
别接
Don't answer it.

534
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:33,063
那他就会起疑心的
Then he'll get worried or suspicious.

535
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,042
喂
Hey.

536
00:27:36,043 --> 00:27:38,082
多曼说你离开现场了
Dornan said you left the scene.

537
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:41,036
为什么  发生什么事了
Why? what's going on?

538
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:43,006
反恐特警组将一切控制得很好
Swat has the operation well in hand.

539
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,011
我在查别的线索
I'm following up on a lead.

540
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:46,014
-什么线索  -在谢克特住处找到的武器
What lead? a weapon we found at schector's.

541
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:47,041
有一部分枪支编号
There's a partial serial number.

542
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,051
我想通过它查到卖家
I want to run it past a source.

543
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:51,038
你和鲍尔在一起吗
With bauer?

544
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,086
是的  他和我在一起
Uh, yes, he's accompanying me.

545
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:58,045
蕾妮
Renee...

546
00:27:58,046 --> 00:28:00,026
到底怎么回事儿
What the hell's going on?

547
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:02,073
你指什么
What are you talking about?

548
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:04,096
眼下只有通过查清那个枪手的情况
Getting our hands on that shooter is our best

549
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:07,056
才能找到阿尔梅达和那个装置
Chance of finding Almeida and finding that device.

550
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:09,084
你不能轻易因为其他探员提供的线索
And I don't think you'd turn your back on that operation

551
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:12,044
而背离整个既定行动
For a lead you could easily have passed off to another agent.

552
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:13,097
我不确定你是什么意思
I'm not sure what you're getting at.

553
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:15,017
我也是
Neither am i.

554
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:18,068
鲍尔让你参与到什么行动里了吗
Has bauer gotten you involved with something?

555
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:23,005
拉里  你相信我吗
Larry, do you trust me?

556
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:26,048
你我心照不宣
You know the answer to that.

557
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:28,015
那请相信我
Then please just accept what I'm telling you.

558
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,068
我们正在追查一条线索
We're following up on a lead,

559
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:33,000
一有发现  我第一时间向你汇报
And I will fill you in if and when we find something.

560
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:38,080
好的
All right.

561
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:41,027
该死
Damn it.

562
00:28:42,018 --> 00:28:43,057
我不喜欢这样
I do not like this.

563
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:46,000
我厌倦了欺骗我的上司
I just flat out lied to my boss.

564
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:48,057
他信了吗
Did he buy it?

565
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,088
我们没事儿了吧
Are we in the clear?

566
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,011
我想是的
Yeah, I think so.

567
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:56,029
好  谢谢
Good. thanks.

568
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:09,036
蕾妮的通信器联线了吗
Is Renee's comm unit active?

569
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:11,033
是的  她开着对讲机
Yeah. her walkie's on.

570
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:12,080
能定位吗
Can you do a triangulation on it?

571
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:15,034
系统可不允许这么做
Well, that's not really what the system is set up for.

572
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,080
-但  我试试看  -认真点
But I can try. do more than try.

573
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,040
我要知道她的位置
I want to know where she is.

574
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,007
-你打电话不就行了  -珍妮丝...
Can you not just call her? Janis...

575
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,041
做就是了
Just do it.

576
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,015
好吧
Okay.

577
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,054
在谢克特办公室时
Back at schector's office,

578
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:45,041
我要你让他说出阿尔梅达的位置
When I told you to get Almeida's location out of him,

579
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,090
你准备下多重的手
How far were you planning to go with that?

580
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:50,040
是你要我不惜一切代价的
You told me to do whatever it takes.

581
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:52,093
对  我是说让你吓一下他
Yeah, I said that for schector's benefit, to scare him,

582
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,021
但你当时真准备下狠手
But you were actually planning to do it.

583
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:58,037
你会怎么对他
How far would you have gone?

584
00:29:58,038 --> 00:29:59,054
这已不重要了
It doesn't matter now.

585
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:00,071
在我看很重要
It does to me.

586
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:03,035
因为你我押上了我的前程
I just put my career on the line because of you,

587
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:05,088
我只想知道我在和谁打交道
And I'd like to know who I'm dealing with.

588
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:07,042
你看过我的资料了
Yeah, well, you read my file.

589
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:11,029
资料上看不出你刚才的行事准则
Your file doesn't tell me how you justify the things that you've done.

590
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,095
最近我不断在为我的所作所为做回答
You know, I've been answering a lot of questions lately about my past and,

591
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:16,003
老实说  我烦透了
Frankly, I'm done.

592
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:18,033
我告诉你帮你找到托尼·阿尔梅达
I told you I'd help you find Tony Almeida.

593
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:20,043
我甚至答应照你的做
I even agreed to do it your way.

594
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:23,037
既然FBI已不可靠  我们别无选择
Since the fbi's been compromised, that's no longer an option.

595
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:25,035
我现在还能帮你找到他
Now, I can still help you find him,

596
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:28,034
但你要让我按我的方法来做
But you're going to have to let me do it my way.

597
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,054
没问题吧
Is that going to be a problem?

598
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:33,029
走着瞧吧
We'll see.

599
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,052
我知道你认为这么做不对
I know you think this is a mistake.

600
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:02,058
先生  我无权评论
It's not my place to say that, sir.

601
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,078
就算是又怎样
And if it was?

602
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:06,072
先生  当局已经对你儿子女友进行询问了
The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.

603
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,002
我不是说这个
Not about this.

604
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:09,078
他们认为我儿子是自杀
They assumed my son killed himself and

605
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,075
因此对他的案子草草了之
Didn't look deeply enough into anything.

606
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,099
这边走  先生
This way, sir.

607
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,035
尽管市场目前疲软
Well, even though the market's been soft,

608
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:18,096
但您一定不愿错过这项投资
You don't want to hedge your buy on this.

609
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:20,066
我今天只能买那么多了
It's really all I can do today.

610
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:23,010
要知道一万股可太少了
You know 10,000 shares isn't going to cut it.

611
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,083
稍等一下
Excuse me a moment.

612
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:26,000
萨曼莎·罗斯
Samantha roth.

613
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:28,001
罗斯小姐  有特工要见您
Miss roth, there is a secret service agent here to see you.

614
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:29,067
什么
What?

615
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,007
他在前台
He's at reception.

616
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:34,085
要找人把他带去你哪里吗
Would you like me to have someone show him to your desk?

617
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:39,035
不用了  我过来
No. um, I'll be right there.

618
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:40,072
好的
All right.

619
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:41,082
我回头给您电话
Let me call you back.

620
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,026
好的
Sure.

621
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:01,088
女士
Ma'am.

622
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:08,059
泰勒先生
Mr. taylor?

623
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,026
真意外啊
This is quite a surprise.

624
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,042
您好吗
How are you?

625
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:14,016
萨曼莎  我想私下和你聊聊
I wanted to have a word with you, sam, in private.

626
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,060
当然可以
Of course.

627
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:20,093
很抱歉  罗杰葬礼后咱俩都没联系过
I'm-i'm really sorry we haven't spoken since roger's funeral.

628
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:25,004
我  我一直很难过
It's just... it's been so difficult for me.

629
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:27,044
萨曼  钱的事儿我知道了
I know about the money, sam.

630
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,003
您说什么
Excuse me?

631
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:31,040
40万美元被转账到开曼群岛的海外帐户上
$400,000 wired to an offshore account in the cayman Islands

632
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:34,085
恰巧就在你发现我儿子尸体的三天后
three days after you found my son's body.

633
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,018
别狡辩了
There's no point in denying it.

634
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:39,015
-我只想知道是谁  为什么给你钱  -给我钱?
I just want to know who paid you and why. paid me?

635
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:40,093
你知道我儿子真正的死因
You know something about my son's death,

636
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:43,022
有人花钱让你闭嘴
And somebody's paid you to keep quiet about it.

637
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:45,056
泰勒先生  事情不是这样的
Mr. taylor, that is just not true.

638
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:48,010
请你回答我的问题
Please, just answer the question!

639
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:57,094
钱
The money...

640
00:32:57,095 --> 00:33:00,081
钱  不是我的
It... it isn't mine.

641
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:02,038
什么意思
What do you mean, it's not yours?

642
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,008
那是我伯母的钱
It belongs to my aunt.

643
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:07,038
去年我伯父过世后  她生活很拮据
She's had financial difficulties since my uncle passed away last year.

644
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,048
那是伯父留下的房产
It's from his divested real estate holdings.

645
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:15,066
我让她把钱转到海外帐户  逃避国税局查账
I suggested she move it to an offshore account to hide it from the irs.

646
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:19,036
你要我相信  我儿子死后三天  你却能镇定地
You want me to believe you had the presence of mind to commit

647
00:33:19,037 --> 00:33:23,066
操作一起税务欺诈  他可是你的爱人
Tax fraud three days after my son died, the man you supposedly loved?

648
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,084
我爱过他
I did love him.

649
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:29,010
我说的也是实话
And I'm telling you the truth.

650
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:30,027
你要相信我
You have to believe me.

651
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:32,011
我不信
I don't.

652
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:34,054
你在撒谎
You're lying.

653
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:37,066
要是你固执己见  我俩也无话可说
Well, if that's what you think then we have nothing left to talk about...

654
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:39,085
告诉我事实  否则你别想走
You're not going anywhere till I get the truth.

655
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,085
放手
Let go of me.

656
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,092
先生
Sir!

657
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:44,018
你知道凶手
You know who murdered my son.

658
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:46,019
没人杀了他
No one murdered him.

659
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,012
他是自杀的
He killed himself.

660
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:51,052
泰勒先生  我们该走了  现在
Mr. taylor, we need to go. right now.

661
00:33:51,053 --> 00:33:56,087
我会找出事实真相的  到时候你就祈祷上帝吧
I'm going to find out what you're hiding, and when I do, god help you.

662
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:08,011
坦纳
Tanner.

663
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,048
我出来了
I'm out.

664
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,004
收到   Emerson和局里的内线联系上了
Copy that. emerson spoke to his man inside the bureau.

665
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:12,055
-他说你没事了  -好的
He says you're clear. good.

666
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,044
我要为下一步行动安排人手
I need to prep my men on the next job

667
00:34:14,045 --> 00:34:16,032
你告诉我们该做什么
So why don't you tell me what we need.

668
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,022
规格等我到了再告诉你
I'll give you the specs when I get there.

669
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,049
你到哪了
Where are you?

670
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,042
我正要开进来了
I'm just pulling in right now.

671
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:23,010
我们做好准备
We'll be standing by.

672
00:34:29,011 --> 00:34:30,066
坦纳一到我们就离开
When tanner gets here, we'll take off.

673
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:34,078
大家收拾一下  你执行删除程序
Why don't you start the deletion program while we pack up?

674
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:51,065
该死  不能再走了
Damn it. we can't go any farther.

675
