够了  我现在就要见她

Ms. taylor, the president will see you as soon she is able

53

那你告诉她  她女儿不想再等了

54
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,036
我现在去医院陪我父亲
I'm going to the hospital to be with my father.

55
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,096
我想在你走之前
I think it would be a good idea

56
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,076
还是去跟她说一声为好
To talk to your mother before you do that.

57
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:07,047
总统有令  让你继续留在白宫
The president's orders are that you remain in the white house.

58
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,027
那么如果我想走
So if i try to leave,

59
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:11,057
你会对我施行人身限制吗
You will actually physically restrain me?

60
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:13,041
不会那样的  泰勒女士
Oh, that would never happen, ms. taylor,

61
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:15,094
因为我知道你对你母亲
Because i know you have too much respect

62
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,055
还有她的工作给予了足够的尊敬
For your mother and her office

63
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:19,061
绝不会做得太离谱
To ever let things get that far.

64
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,025
算你说得好  探员

65
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:26,032
你干这行有好长时间了吧
You've been at this a while.

66
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,042
五届政府  女士
Five administrations, ma'am.

67
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,064
奥莉维亚
Olivia,

68
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,017
你母亲让我告诉你发生了什么事
Your mother asked me to fill you in on what's happening.

69
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,091
恕我直言  伊桑
Well, with all due respect, ethan,

70
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:48,001
她派你来传话是大错特错了
You're the last person she should be sending.

71
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:51,015
城内将会有另外一起恐怖袭击事件
There's about to be another terrorist attack on this city.

72
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:54,022
所以她才让你继续留在这里
That's why she wants you to remain here.

73
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:56,048
你是说会有更多飞机会失事
Are we talking about more planes going down?

74
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:57,092
还不清楚
We don't know.

75
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,029
但是不管会发生什么  都已是迫在眉睫了
But whatever's going to happen will happen soon.

76
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:02,006
我要去五角大楼了
I'm heading to the Pentagon.

77
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:03,063
最重要的是
On top of all of this,

78
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,096
还有一个进兵计划需要处理
There's also the invasion to deal with.

79
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,070
所以  记住
So, bear in mind,

80
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:11,063
你母亲正面临巨大的压力
Your mother's under tremendous pressure right now.

81
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,091
媒体知晓安全措施加强之事
It's only a matter of time before the media picks up

82
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:19,007
只是个时间问题
On the heightened security measures.

83
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:20,051
我要在他们知晓之前
I want to issue a statement

84
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:21,068
发布一个声明
Before that happens.

85
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,048
对袭击的现实可能性进行淡化处理
Play down the actual likelihood of an attack,

86
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,041
告知媒体安全措施
Talk about the security measures

87
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,035
只是出于必要的考虑  而避免谈及...
as being due diligence, rather than...

88
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,058
不  梅瑞狄斯
No, meredith.

89
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:28,088
公众有权了解实情
The public deserves the truth.

90
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:30,028
我们需要强调谨慎和冷静
We stress caution and calm,

91
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,092
但是我们必须承认情报显示
But we acknowledge we have intel

92
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:33,046
我们正面临着又一起恐怖袭击

Being used by terrorists on the south shore of the potomac,

102
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,068
此地就靠近ITP铁路和船厂

103
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:57,085
总统阁下  我们已经确认当中一名男子

00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:43,085
蕾妮·沃克独自追踪线索
Followed a lead on her own

140
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:45,069
来到波托马可河边一个废弃的仓库里
To an abandoned warehouse on the potomac.

141
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,079
发现了一支以朱玛为首的
Got a visual on a heavily-armed commando unit

142
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,009
全副武装的突击队
Led by juma himself.

143
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:50,093
但是在她汇报完之后  就失去了联系
But she went missing right after she called it in.

144
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:52,009
失去联系是什么意思
What do you mean, missing?

145
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:53,026
还不确定
We're not sure.

146
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,053
联邦调查局正在搜索那一区域
The fbi's searching the area,

147
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,026
但是还没有任何她的踪迹
But there's no sign of her, or any evidence

148
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:57,063
也没有关于目标的线索
Telling us what the target might be.

149
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,083
伯内特知道
Burnett knows.

150
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,040
总统以赦免他为交换条件
The president offered him an immunity deal.

151
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,044
他拒绝了  什么都没说
He turned it down, hasn't said a word since.

152
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,031
该死  比尔  他要开口的时候我被拦住了
Damn it, bill, he was talking when they stopped me.

153
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:06,017
把我和他关在一个屋子里  给我5分钟
Put me in a room with him for five minutes,

154
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:07,068
我们能阻止阴谋得逞的
And we can stop this thing from happening.

155
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:09,018
杰克  就算我愿意放了你
Jack, even if i was willing to release you,

156
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:11,018
他也已经被送去肯尼迪医院了
He's being transported to kennedy memorial.

157
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,055
你根本无法接近他
You couldn't get access to him.

158
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:13,072
好吧  那你去
Fine. then you do it.

159
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,088
你能接近他
You can get access.

160
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:16,055
我没受过高压刑讯技术的训练
I'm not trained in coercive techniques.

161
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,032
这件事是板上钉钉的
This is not a maybe.

162
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,069
莱恩·伯内特是恐怖分子的同伙
Ryan burnett is an accessory to a terrorist attack.

163
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:22,079
如果你坐以待毙  无辜百姓就会性命不保
If you don't do this, people will die.

164
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:24,033
我不想跟你争论该做什么
Look, i'm not arguing about what needs to be done.

165
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,016
我不会干  也不想干  那不是我的风格
But i can't do it. i don't do that. it's not me.

166
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,033
-这不是个好理由  -杰克
- That's not good enough. - jack!

167
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,086
该死  比尔  这不是个好理由
Damn it, bill. that's not good enough.

168
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,000
是你告诉我冷眼旁观的人
You were the one who told me, people who stand by--

169
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,033
等同于密谋袭击的帮凶
They might as well help them plant the bomb.

170
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,044
你能行的
You can do this.

171
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:39,057
比尔  你必须干
Bill, you have to do this.

172
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:46,019
我做不到  杰克  对不起
I can't, jack.I'm sorry

173
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,072
比尔
Bill?

174
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:58,013
我做不到
I can't.

175
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:22,062
就是这了  将军
This is it, general.

176
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:33,059
我们在管道的另一边
We're on the other side of the conduit.

177
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,063
你到位了吗
Are you in position?

178
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,013
是的  将军
Yes, general.

179
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,093
准备好了
I'll be ready for you.

180
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,027
怎么了
What was that?

181
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,001
我以为你说话了
I thought i heard you say something.

182
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,084
我自言自语呢
Just, uh, talking to myself.

183
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:50,021
对了  我跟你说了周六
Yeah. hey, i tell you we're having people over

184
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:51,045
我们来几个人搞个派对
On saturday?

185
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,082
没什么特别的  就是带点中国菜
Nothing fancy. we're bringing in chinese.

186
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,098
这回你能去吗
You think you're gonna make it this time?

187
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:58,052
中国菜
Oh. chinese.

188
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:01,069
但我还是想吃希拉做的饭
But i was looking forward to sheila's cooking.

189
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:27,022
搞定  将军
All clear, general.

190
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,072
干得好
Excellent.

191
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:46,070
10秒钟后  我们就能进入
We'll have access in ten seconds.

192
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,070
一旦进入里边  在附近的报警器
Once we're in, we'll have two minutes

193
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:51,007
报警之前我们有2分钟的时间
Until the proximity alarms come back up.

194
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:52,041

195
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,041

行动

198
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:41,099
我已进入特勤局追踪网络
I've accessed the secret service tracking grid.

199
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:46,009
她在哪
Where is she?

200
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:48,080
就在总统办公室里
Right here in the oval office.

201
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,013
出发
Let's go.

202
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:21,060
安全
Clear.

203
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:33,021
我们可能会遇到抵抗
We will meet resistance,

204
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:36,084
并且必须悄无声息  速战速决
which we must counter quickly.Silently.

205
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,081
距离下一次
We have nine minutes

206
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:40,098
特勤局例行通话还有9分钟
until the next secret service roll call.

207
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:43,045
我们必须在这之前找到总统
We must find the president by then.

208
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,084
那会澄清那件事
That will clarify that.

209
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,000
没错  一旦准备好发布
Yeah, I'll let you know,

210
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:15,074
我就会通知你

211
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,077
放下电话
Let go of the phone.

212
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,010
距例行通话还有5分钟  将军

213
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,000
朱玛派人杀了你父亲
Juma had your father killed.

214
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,060

What?

215
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:03,047
听着  我知道杜巴库是你父亲
Listen to me, I know that Dubaku is your father.

216
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:04,094
朱玛一直在骗你

你父亲死了

我爸活着
My father is alive!

219
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,038
朱玛必须杀人灭口
Juma had to make sure that your father didn't talk.

220
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:13,038
所以他派一个叫乌铎的人杀了你父亲
So he sent a man named Udo to murder him.

221
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:16,022
不  不  我不相信你
No. No, I... I don't believe you.

222

乌铎杀他的时候我就在场

00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:21,029
我跟踪他上了轨道车才找到了你
That's how I found you. By following him back to the rail car.

朱玛将军背叛了你
General Juma betrayed you.

225

00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,042
很可靠  她说他们是从地下管道进入的
Firsthand. She says they're getting in via subterranean access.

235
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:30,059
我会启用安全屋

将军
General.

280
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,013
总统离开了办公室
The president has left the oval office.

281
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,074
她正朝西边走廊走去
She's heading down the west corridor.

282
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,007
乌铎  带你的人去那边

我们两面夹击

我们离总统越来越近了  长官

285
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,007
在前面  绕过这个弯儿
Up ahead, around this corner.

286
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:09,095
总统的追踪器  长官
The president's tracker, sir.

287
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:15,022
他们知道我们来了

288
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:17,032
他们正把总统送往安全屋
They're moving the president to the lockdown.

289
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,073
找到她

00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:30,074
带上他  我们需要人质

291
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:32,061
把他们押到一起

292
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,068
行动
Let's move.

293
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,096
我们在去安全屋的途中遭遇敌人火力
We've engaged hostiles on the way to the lockdown.

294
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:54,030
我们没看到总统
We do not have a visual on the president.

295
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,083
我们还有两分钟路程
We're still two minutes away.

296
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,063
起来
Get up!

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,014

快走  快走  快走
Move it! Come on! Come on, move it! Come on!

299
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,094
亚伦  我是杰克  我和总统在一起
Aaron, it's Jack. I'm with the president,

300
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,034
正去安全屋  你在哪

303
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:17,028
敌人已占领了这个楼面
Hostiles are in control of the area.

304
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:19,042
我正在考虑如何绕过他们抵达安全屋

305
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,002

You're going to have about 30 seconds to get here

307
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,096

- before I have to seal this door. - Understood.

308
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:28,002
我女儿不来不许你关门
You will not close this door until my daughter gets here.

309
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:30,027
总统阁下  现在您的性命高于一切
Madam president, right now, your life is the priority,

310
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,090
由不得您 请进屋
whether you like it or not. Please, step inside.

311
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:51,002
总统阁下  您还好吗
Madam president, are you all right?

312
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:52,022
亚伦  我是杰克

我们已经在安全屋内

我们遇到袭击  别无选择
We came under attack. We didn't have a choice.

315
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:57,039
反正我们也无法到达了  杰克
We couldn't have made it anyway, Jack.

316
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:58,093
我们会试着找条路出去
We'll try to find a way out of the building.

317
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,006
收到  亚伦

妈的  朱玛切断了我们的联系
Damn it. Juma's cut off our communication.

322
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:13,044
我必须确认我女儿的安全
I need to know that my daughter's safe.

323
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,024
总统阁下  我还无法确保这点
Madam president, I can't answer that yet.

324
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,075
安博
Abo.

325
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,065
朱玛将军
General Juma,

326
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,028
他们的增援来了
They brought in reinforcements.

327
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,061
我不知道
I don't know how much longer

328
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,082
我们还能守住多久
we can hold them off from your position.

329
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:58,042
原地待命
Stand by.

330
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,095
盖兹
Ngozi?

331
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:03,082
探员正从四面八方赶来
Agents are moving in from

332
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:05,099
敌众我寡  实力悬殊
all directions; we will be heavily outnumbered.

333
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,047
探员们知不知道 总统在安全屋里
Does secret service know the president is secured in the lockdown?

334
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,047
唯一一个看见的人已经死了
The only ones who saw are dead.

335
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:15,077
把我接通到他们的通讯频道
Put me on to their communications channel.

336
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,087
说吧  长官
Go ahead, sir.

337
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:20,044
我是朱玛将军
This is general Juma.

338
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,014
我抓住了总统
I have the president.

339
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,055
立即撤退  否则我就杀了她
Evacuate immediately, or she will die.

340
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,082
我需要确认总统在你手上  才能下令撤退
I need proof you have the president before I can give that order.

341
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,079
-让我们和她通话  -你是谁
- Let us speak to her. - Who is this?

342
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:35,029
霍维斯探员
Special Agent Hovis.

343
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,076
霍维斯探员
Agent Hovis,

344
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,053
把你的人撤出白宫
Move your men out of the building

345
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,033
撤出警戒线  不然我就杀了总统
and beyond the fence line, or I will kill the president.

346
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,047
而且她的死会算在你头上
And her death will be on your head.

347
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,084
霍维斯探员
Agent Hovis?

348
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,047
我们正在撤
We're pulling back.

349
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:52,047
所有探员  立即撤退
All agents, fall back immediately!

350
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:56,024
重复  所有探员撤退
I repeat：all agents fall back.

351
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:09,096
将军  特勤局正在撤退
General, secret service is retreating.

352
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:16,033
他们正在撤  将军
They are retreating, general.

353
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,067
所有人都撤了吗
All of them?

354
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:20,037
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

355
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:23,010
把所有人质带到这儿来
Gather all the hostages and bring them here.

356
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,084
-封锁出口  行动  -遵命  长官
- Lock down the exits. Move. - Yes sir.

357
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:42,079
确认西区探员正在撤退
Confirming secret service retreat in western quadrant.

358
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:45,023
收到  将军
Copy, general.

359
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:49,043
特勤局撤退的唯一原因
The only reason secret service would retreat

360
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,030
是他们以为总统在他们手上
is if they thought juma had the president.

361
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:54,014
但是鲍尔说他已经把我妈送进安全屋了
But that man, Bauer, said he got  my mother into the lockdown.

362
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,000
朱玛在虚张声势
Juma's bluffing them.

363
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:58,017
我们得从这儿出去
We need to get out of here

364
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,081
让大家知道这里的情况并夺回白宫
and let our people know that as soon as possible so they can retake the building

365
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:02,068
从这儿出去  怎么做  到处都是他们的人
Get out of here? How? They're everywhere.

366
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:04,024
快走
- Move it! -Shh!

367
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:09,038

373
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:26,080

374
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:27,080
出来
Get out here.

375
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:28,087
快点  快点
Move it. move it.

376
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,087
就是这  快点
Right here. keep going.

377
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,071
快点  快点
Come on. move it!

378
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:32,097
蹲下  蹲下  都蹲下
Sit down! sit down! everyone down!

379
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:34,071
都蹲下
Everyone down!

380
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:36,001
蹲下  快

381
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:40,035
蹲下  转过身去  转过去
Get down! turn around. turn around.

382
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:53,033
你能打开吗
Can you open it?

383
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,000
能
Yes.

384
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,087
要是霍奇给我们的说明书没错的话
Assuming the specifications hodges gave us are correct.

385
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:58,097
要多久
How long?

386
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,050
15分钟
15 minutes.

387
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,060
我们在一层的一个走廊里和他们正面交火
We confronted them in one of the first floor corridors.

388
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:38,053
那时  朱玛让我们撤退
At that point, Juma ordered us to retreat,

389
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,004
威胁说如果我们不照办的话会杀了总统
Threatening to kill the president if we didn't comply.

390
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,044
但我们没亲眼见到
But he never gave a visual confirmation

391
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:45,037
-总统在他手里  -没有  但我觉得
- He was holding the president? - No, he didn't, but i felt,

392
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:47,034
那时我除了撤退没别的路可走
At that point, i had no choice but to pull back.

393
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,098
他的人在屠杀平民和探员们
His men were killing civilians and agents.

394
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:50,098
知道现在还有多少人被困吗
Any idea how many people are still trapped inside?

395
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:53,038
比对工作人员名单和已撤离人员的姓名
Cross-checking the evacuees with the white house manifest.

396
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,015
到现在为止  好像是53个
So far, it looks like 53.

397
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:58,007
有特勤局的人吗
Any secret service?

398
00:23:58,007 --> 00:23:59,099
据我所知 里面的探员都牺牲了
As far as I know, We have no agents left in there still alive.

399
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,067
人质救援小组已各就各位
Hostage Rescue Team is moving in the place.

400
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,046
他们已经整装待发
They'll be prepared to storm

401
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:06,036
只要一声令下他们就猛攻进去
The building as soon as the order is given.

402
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:07,086
是呀  这个节骨眼上
Yeah, well, at this point,

403
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:10,045
必须让副总统定夺了
That order has to be given by the vice president.

404
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:11,057
他在哪
What's his status?

405
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:14,054
特勤局正护送他前往一个安全的地方
Secret service has him en route To a secure location.

406
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,004
好的  他安全了通知我一声
All right, let me know as soon as he's locked down.

407
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:19,094
霍维斯  给我一份白宫的红外卫星扫描图
And Hovis, I need an infrared sat-scan of the building.

408
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,018
要最高的分辨率
Highest resolution possible.

409
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,074
好的
Got it.

410
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,001
[登记名单:  杰克·鲍尔]
Jack Bauer

411
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:30,080
你没跟我说杰克在白宫
You didn't tell me that jack was in the white house.

412
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,072
他是被捕了
He was under arrest.

413
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:35,004
在袭击发生时他被看管着
Being held under guard when the attack took place.

414
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:36,016
为什么被捕
Under arrest for what?

415
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,073
他发现了参议员迈尔的副手伯内特
He found out an aide to senator mayer named burnett

416
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,023
参与了这场阴谋
Was part of the conspiracy.

417
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:46,053
杰克对他逼供时被逮个正着  就在白宫里面
He was caught torturing him... In the white house.

418
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,024
差点要了他的性命
Almost killed the man before he was stopped.

419
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:57,001
蕾妮  你的首要任务是总统  不是杰克·鲍尔
Renee, the president is our priority, not jack bauer.

420
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:58,031
-明白了吗  -明白了
- Are we clear on that? - Clear.

421
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,015
-你确定  -是的
- Are you sure? - Yes.

422
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,039
他们正带来更多的人质
They're bringing in more hostages.

423
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,006
快坐下
Get down! now!

424
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,090
过来  坐下
Get in here! sit!

425
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,017
不许说话
No talking.

426
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:22,084
我没有看到奥利维亚
I don't see olivia.

427
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,064
是好消息啊  总统阁下
Madam president, that's good news.

428
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:26,050
我了解亚伦·皮尔斯
I know aaron pierce.

429
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,024
他会尽他所能  保护您的女儿
He will do everything in his power to make sure that your daughter is safe.

430
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:31,028
我的上帝  这可是白宫啊
This is the white house, for god's sake.

431
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:33,018
他们怎么通过我们的
How is it possible that they were able

432
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,075
重重警戒的
To get around our security protocols?

433
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,088
只有一种可能
There's only one explanation.

434
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:37,035
他们有内应
They had help on the inside.

435
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,055
是谁
From whom?

436
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,016
这太疯狂了
Oh, this is insane.

437
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:51,040
朱玛肯定知道他不可能活着出去了
Juma must realize that there's no way for him to get out of this alive.

438
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:53,050
恐怕是的  这是他的最后一搏
I'm afraid he does. This is his endgame.

439
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:54,097
他来这个国家是为了敲山震虎
He came here to make a statement,

440
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:56,040
而他甘愿为此牺牲
And he's willing to die for it.

441
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:59,007
当营救小组知道您没事时  就会再冲进来的
As soon as the rescue teams realize that you're secure, they'll move in.

442
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:01,064
只是时间问题
It's only a matter of time.

443
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:03,058
他在干什么
What's he doing?

444
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:05,048
-是爆炸装置吗  -不对
- Is that some kind of explosive? - no.

445
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:06,091
鲍尔
Mr. bauer?

446
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,075
天哪
Oh, my god.

447
00:26:08,082 --> 00:26:11,002
他们有通行密码
They've got the access codes.

448
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:13,002
我必须人让那个控制面板短路
I need to get into that panel.

449
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,036
我能做什么吗
Is there something I can do?

450
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:16,006
把那个工具箱给我
Yeah, give me that toolbox over there.

451
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:17,053
放在桌子上
Put it on the table.

452
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:38,019
该死
Damn it.

453
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:46,043
总统阁下  把插头插进去
Madam president, plug the cord into the wall, please.

454
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:47,099
快点
Now.

455
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:58,034
好了
Okay.

456
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:05,088
将军
General.

457
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:11,078
怎么了
What's wrong?

458
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,082
突然坏了
It just went dead.

459
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:16,039
他们肯定是从里面把线路搞短路了
Somehow, they must have disabled the circuitry from inside.

460
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:19,006
我们用C4炸弹炸开门
Then, we'll use c4 to blow open the door.

461
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,013
我们必须要在11个锁眼都打洞
We'll have to drill sinkholes into each of the 11 locking rods.

462
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,016
太费时间了
It will take too long.

463
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,057
这得看钢筋有多坚固
Depending on how the steel is hardened,

464
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:27,023
C4炸药可能都不管用
C4 might not even work.

465
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,007
车到山前必有路
Then we'll find another way.

466
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:48,022
不可否认的是
There can be no room for doubt.

467
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:51,032
总统已成困兽
We have the president trapped.

468
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,040
只要我们打开那扇门  就可以名垂青史了
We open up that door, we become a part of history.

469
00:27:55,046 --> 00:27:58,013
车到山前必有路
We will find another way.

470
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:20,099
请讲
Yes.

471
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,092
等一下
Just a moment.

472
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:28,096
有您的专线电话
Call came in on the dedicated uplink.

473
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:30,026
我听到了
I heard it.

474
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:32,000
是他  长官
It's him, sir.

475
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:39,067
开到免提
Put him on speaker.

476
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:45,048
将军  没想到会和你直接通话
General, didn't expect to be hearing from you directly.

477
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,015
我可以为你做些什么
What is it i can do for you?

478
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:48,065
我们有一个麻烦
We have a problem.

479
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:51,062
总统在安全屋里
The president is secured in the lockdown.

480
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,069
在下早有所料
Well, we prepared you for that possibility.

481
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:55,096
我把那个安全屋的设施说明书给你了
We gave you the specs for the locking mechanism.

482
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,066
他们在里面把控制面板短路了
They shorted the lock out from the inside.

483
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:01,059
请你再帮我找一个进去的方法
I need you to find me another way in.

484
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:04,010
将军  我已倾囊相助了
General, I've given you everything i have to give.

485
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,080
我的使命已经完成了
My part in this thing is over.

486
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:16,078
你忘记了你货物还没有到手吧
Are you forgetting that you don't have the shipment yet?

487
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:20,015
将军  我希望你言而有信
Now, general, I expect you to be an honorable man.

488
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,018
我们有约在先
We made a deal.

489
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,082
我遵守了我的承诺
We held up our end of the bargain.

490
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:24,025
把你弄进了白宫
We got you in the white house.

491
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:26,005
我希望你也能信守你的承诺
I expect you to hold up yours.

492
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:27,085
我对你的期望不感兴趣
I don't care about your expectations.

493
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:30,069
你不帮我的话  我就在货到你那里之前
You help me, or i will destroy that shipment

494
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:32,059
把它销毁
Before it ever arrives to you.

495
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,013
等会
Hang on.

496
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,083
好吧
Well...

497
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,083
西顿  你怎么想
Seaton, what do you think?

498
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,047
他真的做得出来吗
Can he do what he says?

499
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:45,007
两小时内船都不会靠岸
The shipment's not due in the port for another two hours.

500
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:48,058
他的人有的是时间 毁了它   让它报废
His men will have plenty of time to destroy it, render it useless.

501
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,062
将军
General?

502
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:01,095
告诉我  安全屋里还有谁
Tell me-- who else is in the lockdown with the president?

503
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:05,012
我的人看到她和另一个人进去了
My men saw her enter with another man.

504
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,043
我在看白宫的人员清单
Well, i'm looking at the white house manifest,

505
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,026
上面说  奥利维亚·泰勒
And according to this, olivia taylor

506
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:13,090
现在正在你那边
Is presently in the building with you.

507
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:16,030
总统的女儿
The president's daughter?

508
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:17,027
你确定
Are you sure?

509
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:20,041
这个系统自动记录进出人员
Their system logs everyone in and out electronically.

510
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:22,048
如果上面说她在的话  她一定在
If it says that she's in there, she's in there.

511
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,021
把她找到
Now, you find olivia taylor,

512
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:27,028
你就可以威胁总统开门了
And you'll get the president to open that door.

513
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:30,065
你的船会如期到达的
Your shipment will arrive as planned.

514
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:32,052
谢谢
Thank you.

515
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:37,096
看见了吗  压力
There, you see-- stress.

516
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,016
压力
Stress...

517
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:42,060
才是创造力之本
Is the fertilizer of creativity.

518
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:45,080
还是玩会飞镖吧
Let's play some darts.

519
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,067
总统的女儿就在白宫
The president's daughter is somewhere in the white house.

520
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:51,037
我们去找到她
Let's find her.

521
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:01,035
抬起头来
Raise your heads.

522
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,025
让我看到你们的脸
Show me your faces.

523
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:20,000
你觉得发生什么事了
What do you think's going on?

524
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,054
我问你话呢
I asked you a question,

525
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,010
布坎南先生
Mr. buchanan.

526
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:30,038
你是不是觉得我惩罚鲍尔错了
You think I made the wrong call with bauer.

527
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:32,055
你觉得我要是甩手不管
You think that if I'd signed off

528
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:34,025
他逼供莱恩·伯内特的事
On him torturing ryan burnett,

529
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,085
一切就都可以避免了吗
All of this could have been avoided?

530
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,025
参议员  你根本不知道我在想什么
You don't know what i'm thinking, senator.

531
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,083
她不在这
She's not here.

532
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:54,053
快去把她找出来  带她来见我
Go ahead and find her and bring her to me.

533
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:19,076
怎么了
What happened?

534
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,023
-你看到什么了  -那扇门有警卫看守
- What did you see? - The door's guarded.

535
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:22,093
肯定有别的出路
Well, there's got to be another way out.

536
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,006
这边只有三个出口
There are only three exits

537
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:25,050
但是全有人把守
To this wing, and they're all covered.

538
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:27,054
窗户全是加固封锁的  根本打不破
The windows are sealed and hardened. Unbreakable.

539
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:28,090
我必须让他们知道
We have to let them know

540
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:31,004
恐怖分子在虚张声势   我妈不在他们手中
The terrorists are bluffing; that they don't have my mother.

541
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,051
我们只能往外发信号
Our only option is to get a signal out.

542
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:34,094
我们可以往窗外
We can do it from the windows

543
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:36,058
-发信号  -好的  好的
- Of the residence. - Okay, okay, good.

544
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:38,075
如果我把你留在安全地带会更好点
You'll be safer if I leave you in a secure area.

545
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,005
我发好信号就会回来找你
I'll get the signal out and come back for you.

546
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:43,055
我不会躲在该死的通风口的  皮尔斯探员
I'm not gonna sit and hide in some damn vent, agent pierce.

547
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:45,092
女士  路途遥远
Ma'am, it is a long way,

548
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,089
我们可能会遭遇更多敌人
And we're probably gonna encounter more of juma's men.

549
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:49,006
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

550
00:32:49,012 --> 00:32:50,032
我不管
I don't care.

551
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,079
我跟着你  别争执了
I'm going with you, and don't try to argue.

552
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,043
没时间了
We don't have the time.

553
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:56,080
好吧
Okay.

554
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:58,046
跟在我后面
Stay behind me.

555
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:16,028
莫斯探员  红外卫星扫描已经就绪
Agent moss, sat-scan's all set up here.

556
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,025
我们能看到一群人质  但无法分辨个体
We can see the cluster of hostages, but not the individual bodies.

557
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,000
能更进一步吗  让图像更清晰点
That the best they can do? They can't boost the resolution on this?

558
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,075
不行  长官  白宫是世界上
no, sir. The white house is one of the most

559
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:26,024
防护最好的建筑物
heavily shielded buildings in the world.

560
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,062
收到
Yeah, got it.

561
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:32,009
-副总统已经接通  可以通话了  -多谢
- The vice president's ready. They're initiating communication.  - thanks.

562
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,090
大家出去下
Give us the room.

563
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:48,081
你在和副总统通话
You're on with the vice president.

564
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:51,014
副总统阁下  我是莫斯探员
Mr. vice president, i'm special agent moss,

565
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:53,005
联邦调查局首府分部的主管
Head of the fbi's dc branch.

566
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:54,081
这是沃克探员
This is agent walker.

567
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:56,082
我收到通报了
I've been briefed on the general situation.

568
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:58,058
最新情况是什么
What are the latest facts on the ground?

569
00:33:58,065 --> 00:34:00,025
没有朱玛的进一步消息
There's nothing further from general juma,

570
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:01,069
但红外扫描显示
But an infrared scan of the building

571
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:03,086
他把人质集中到
Shows he's holding the hostages in a hallway

572
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:05,032
罗斯福厅外的走廊来
Outside the roosevelt room.

573
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,033
对于总统来讲是个好消息
Now this is very possibly good news for the president.

574
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,056
解释下
Explain.

575
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:12,033
那个区域易攻难守
The area's not one of the more defensible places in the building.

576
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,037
战术上讲  朱玛不应该选那作为阵地
Tactically, it makes no sense for juma to have chosen it as a base.

577
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:18,094
但那地方临近安全屋
However, the area is adjacent to the ground floor lockdown,

578
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,017
我们知道那是总统的必经之路
Which we know the president was en route to.

579
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:23,094
你觉得总统在里面了
So, you think the president made it into the lockdown?

580
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:26,058
这是最合理的解释
That's our best explanation for him being there.

581
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,068
所以我们请求您
We're therefore are asking you to authorize

582
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:31,062
在朱玛攻破安全屋前  下达营救命令
The rescue operation before juma manages to penetrate the lockdown.

583
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:39,013
还有别的证据表明
Do you have any other evidence that supports your theory

584
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:42,013
总统在安全屋里面吗
That the president is in the lockdown?

585
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,016
他曾被要求出示总统被控制的证据
There's the fact that he couldn't produce the president

586
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:47,023
但他没能做到
When we asked him to prove that he had her.

587
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,070
不能还是不愿意
Couldn't or wouldn't?

588
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:50,040
你也不能确定  是吗
You can't be certain which one it is, can you?

589
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,021
我们确实无法断定  阁下
Certainty's not possible in this case, sir.

590
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:53,054
但这是最好的判断
We're giving you our best estimation

591
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:55,074
我们请求您批准行动
And we urge you to allow us to launch.

592
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,071
如果你错了呢
What if you're wrong?

593
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:00,031
如果朱玛控制了总统呢
What if juma does have the president?

594
00:35:00,038 --> 00:35:03,015
如果你攻击  他会立即杀了总统的
He will kill her as soon as he realizes what you're doing.

595
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:05,055
不行动也是有风险的  阁下
Inaction has its own risks, too, sir.

596
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,089
如果朱玛有更多的时间来加强防卫
The more time juma has to reinforce his position,

597
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:10,056
攻占白宫和营救人质会变得更加困难
The more difficult it'll be to take the building and save lives

598
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:12,073
我明白
I understand.

599
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,006
但首要考虑的是总统的性命
But my priority must be the president's life.

600
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,097
没有更多总统的情况前
Prudence dictates that i hold off on authorizing the rescue operation

601
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:21,000
我要谨慎从事
Until we can be more certain of her status.

602
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:22,037
副总统阁下
Mr. vice president,

603
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:24,040
恐怖分子控制了白宫
Terrorists are in control of the white house.

604
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:28,071
我想问您谨慎是合理的反应吗
I would ask you to consider if prudence is the appropriate response in this situation.

605
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:32,098
沃克探员  我感谢你的建议
I thank you for your thoughts, agent walker.

606
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:38,002
除非你能提供里面更多的情况
Until you can provide me with more intel on what's going on in there,

607
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:42,009
否则你绝不能轻举妄动
You are instructed to refrain from launching any action.

608
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:45,096
及时向我通报最新情况
Keep me apprised of any further developments.

609
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:51,013
他就只管自己的前途
All he's interested in is covering his own ass.

610
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,063
他是副总统
He's the vice president.

611
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,053
现在他说了算
Right now, he's calling the shots.

612
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,030
您的决定是英明的  阁下
It was the right call, sir.

613
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:00,091
您没法下达一个置总统于死地
You can't order an operation that results in the president's death

614
00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:02,037
而自己却平步青云的命令
And your own elevation to the job.

615
00:36:02,044 --> 00:36:03,094
这在政治上是不可接受的
It would be politically untenable.

616
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:09,022
别再这样说了  德里克
Never let anyone hear you talking like that, derek.

617
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:10,072
明白吗
Understood?

618
00:36:10,078 --> 00:36:11,082
遵命  阁下
Yes, sir.

619
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,061
天哪
Oh, god...

620
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,061
我的天  亚伦
Oh, my god, aaron!

621
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,031
他们会听到枪声
They would've heard those shots,

622
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,068
你必须在他们来之前发出信号
So you're going to need to get the signal out before they get back.

623
00:36:41,085 --> 00:36:45,052
门后面有个安全箱
There's a security kit behind that door in the bureau.

624
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:48,042
有急救设备和手电筒
It's got first aid and a flashlight.

625
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:50,069
你去窗口闪摩斯码
You'll flash morse code out the window.

626
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:52,052
摸下我夹克  那有只笔
Reach in my jacket. i got a pen.

627
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:54,046
这
Here.

628
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:56,026
给我
Give it to me.

629
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:58,093
把手伸过来
Give me your hand.

630
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:02,094
这是"绿色代码"
This is called "code green."

631
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,080
一点表明短闪烁  一横表示长闪烁
A dot is a short blink; a dash is a long one.

632
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:08,074
"绿色代码"就是暗示  让他们行动
"code green" will signal them to move in.

633
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:10,018
快去
Go!

634
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,014
朱玛将军
General juma,

635
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:42,067
我抓到总统女儿了
I have the president's daughter.

636
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,075
带上他
Bring him.

637
00:38:14,045 --> 00:38:17,038
消息人士称40分钟前
Sources have confirmed that the siege inside the white house

638
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,042
白宫已经被包围
Began approximately 40 minutes ago.

639
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:23,012
我们还没得知  到底有多少名人质
We do not yet have confirmation On the number of hostages being held,

640
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:24,059
或者总统是否已落入敌手
Or if the president is among them.

641
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:29,056
我身后  可以看到几支特警队正在待命
Behind me, you can see dozens of tactical assault units standing by.

642
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:32,066
政府分析师告诉我们  攻击命令的下达
Government analysts tell us the order to launching to cut out

643
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:35,083
在当前局势下  完全取决于副总统
In these circumstances would rest with the vice president.

644
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,054
将军  我发现在吊灯里有光纤摄像头
General, i discovered fiber-optic cameras embedded in the chandelier.

645
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:05,000
坐下
Sit!

646
00:39:05,006 --> 00:39:06,066
给我张椅子
Get me a chair.

647
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:08,000
遵命  将军
Yes, general.

648
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:23,001
他发现摄像头了
He spotted the cameras.

649
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:28,002
给我条安全通话线路
Give me a secure channel.

650
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:30,062
讲吧  长官
Go ahead, sir.

651
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:33,006
泰勒总统
President taylor,

652
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:36,073
我知道你看得见
I see now that you've been watching us.

653
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,033
好
Good.

654
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,040
我想让你看一样东西
There is something else i think you should see.

655
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:50,068
上帝啊  不要
God, no.

656
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:57,015
如果你不开门
If you don't open the door,

657
00:39:57,022 --> 00:40:01,055
我会一只一只地把你女儿眼睛挖出来
I'm going to cut out your daughter's eyes one by one.

658
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:07,083
然后我会把她舌头割掉
And then i'm going to cut out her tongue...

659
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:10,006
接着是她的头
...and then her head.

660
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:11,080
妈  别听他的
Mom, don't listen!

661
00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:13,090
我知道你的想法
I know what you're thinking.

662
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:17,047
怎么能保证开门后我就不杀她呢
How do you know if you open the door that i won't kill her?

663
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:18,097
但你只需要知道
All you need to know

664
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:22,071
如果你不开门  她就死定了
Is that i most certainly will kill her If you don't.

665
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:28,098
开门
Open the door.

666
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:30,092
-总统阁下  我不能  -开门
- Madam president, i can't!  - no. open the door.

667
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:32,082
-把门打开  -我不能
- Open the door!  - i can't!

668
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:35,072
我女儿在外面
That is my daughter out there.

669
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,045
你明白吗
Do you understand?

670
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:39,059
我已经失去了儿子
I've already lost my son.

671
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:42,029
你知道丧子之痛的痛苦吗
Have you any idea what it's like to lose a child?

672
00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:44,029
总统阁下  我真的很抱歉
Madam president, i am genuinely sorry,

673
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:46,006
但我不能让他们抓到你
But i cannot let them take you.

674
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:48,000
你现在帮不了她
There is nothing you can do for her now.

675
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:51,060
你有孩子吗  杰克
Do you have children, jack?

676
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:55,027
有个女儿
I have a daughter.

677
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:58,044
你能做到你要求我的吗
Could you do what you're asking me to do?

678
00:40:58,051 --> 00:41:00,078
站在这看着她被杀害
Just stand by and watch her butchered?

679
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,045
不能  阁下
No, ma'am.

680
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:05,032
但我不是美国总统
But i am not the president of the united states.

681
00:41:05,038 --> 00:41:08,005
我是总统
Well, i am the president.

682
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:11,049
我命令你打开门
And i am ordering you to open that door.

683
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:33,008
你没时间了
You're running out of time.

684
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:39,012
妈
Mom...

685
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:42,035
也许这会让你妈早做决定
Perhaps this will make your mother decide more quickly.

686
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:08,071
妈  你不应该
Mom, you shouldn't have...

687
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:12,072
