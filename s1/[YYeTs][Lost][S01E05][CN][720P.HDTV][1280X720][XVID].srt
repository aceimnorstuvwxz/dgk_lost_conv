3
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:06,015
已经没事了
You're okay.

4
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:08,071
深呼吸
Just deep breaths now.

5
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,016
呼吸
Just breathe.

6
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,040
呼吸就行了
Just breathe.

7
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:17,042
你救她了吗?
Did you get her?

8
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:19,049
什么?
What?

9
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:23,054
有位女士  我正尝试着...
There was a woman. I was trying...

10
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:24,086
你救她了吗?
Did you get her?

11
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:29,065
救命!
Help!

12
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:32,034
我们得回到岸边去
We gotta go back.

13
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,011
救命! 救命!
Help! Help!

14
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,040
不用管我
Come on.

15
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,066
Jack!

16
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,068
那儿还有个人!
There's someone else still out there.

17
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,059
-Jack  或许你应该...  -她是谁?
-Jack, maybe you should...  -Who was she?

18
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:59,073
她叫Joanna
Her name was Joanna.

19
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,014
她本不应该在这飞机上的
She wasn't supposed to be on the plane.

20
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:07,031
前几天她在暗礁里潜水  后来耳朵发炎了
She was scuba diving off the Barrier Reef and got an ear infection,

21
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,061
医生叫她再呆两天
and so the doctor grounded her for two days.

22
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:12,001
所以她改了航班
She bumped her flight.

23
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,009
结果落得和我们一样的下场
That's how she ended up with us.

24
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,006
早上 她只是在游泳
She was just swimming this morning.

25
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,081
结果陷入急流里了
Got caught in the riptide.

26
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,080
在这已经有6天了 我却从没和她说过话
We've been here six days. I never talked to her.

27
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,002
我甚至一句话都没和她说过
Never said a word.

28
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:27,064
-Jack 不要这样...  -我们总共有47个人
-Jack, don't...  -There are 47 of us.

29
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,010
-我却一句话都没和她说过  -你已经尽力了
-Never said a word.  -You tried.

30
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:30,001
不  我没有
No, I didn't

31
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,000
我以为我可以...
I thought maybe I could...

32
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:37,013
我还以为我可以先把他救上岸 然后仍有足够的时间去救她
I thought I could bring him back and still have the time.

33
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:39,062
我就在那儿...
I was there... in the water.

34
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:41,001
水里面...
in the water.

35
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,018
我没有尽力
I didn't try.
	
40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,880
我决定不去救她了
I decided not to go after her.

36
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,088
Jack?

37
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,019
Jack?

38
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:05,071
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

39
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:07,030
你看到了吗?
Did you see that?

40
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:08,030
什么?
What?

41
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,060
有个男的  站在水里
Standing there in the water, there was a man.

42
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,019
你没看到?!
You didn't see that?

43
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,036
Jack  你最近一次睡觉是什么时候?
Jack, when was the last time you slept?

44
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,077
我得把这个和其它的工具放一块儿
I need to put this with the rest of the gear.

45
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:39,004
谁教你的?
Who taught you that?

46
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,004
那个韩国妇女
The Korean lady.

47
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:45,011
不要咽下去
Don't swallow it.

48
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,054
海水会越喝越渴的
Ocean water will make you thirsty.

49
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,029
为什么?
Why?

50
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,079
不要咽下去就是了 行吗 小子?
Just don't swallow it, man. All right?

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,040
看看你的嘴唇

52
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
你确实需要喝点水了

53
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
不 不用 我很好

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
谢谢

55
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,000
什么时候才会有人告诉我们要做什么

56
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
我认为不会有人来救我们

57
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,070
救援队很快就会来的

58
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
其他人...他们忽略了我们

59
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,090
如果我们尝试着努力沟通...

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,040
我们会获救的

61
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,040
我们不需要任何人的帮助

62
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
我会告诉你应该做什么的

63
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:11,075
你有没拿到?
Have you got it, or what?

64
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:14,006
你遮住了我的光  棍子
You're in my light, sticks.

65
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:18,000
-"光棍子"?  你到底在说什么呀?!  -光 逗号 棍子
-What the hell is that supposed to...?  -Light, comma, sticks.

66
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,098
你的腿和棍子一样苗条
As in those legs of yours.

67
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,036
听着 即使我很喜欢你给我起的绰号
While I love my new nickname,

68
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,052
-而且叫起来很好听...  -冷静
-and I think it's sweet...  -Calm down.

69
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,074
我拿到你要的东西了
I got your damn stuff.

70
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,041
能防止沙蚤叮咬?
It'll keep off sand fleas?

71
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,048
当然
You bet.

72
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:33,074
即使含有芦荟
Even has aloe.

73
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:37,034
多少钱?
How much?

74
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:40,067
钱在这儿没有用
Your money's no good here.

75
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,084
那你到底要什么?
Then what the hell do you want?

76
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:48,017
-如果你真认为我...  -5000美元
-If you really think I...  -Five grand.

77
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:50,097
你不是说钱没用吗?!
I thought you said my money as no good here.

78
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:52,089
我在协商
I was negotiating.

79
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:54,076
我可以接受"I.O.U"(我欠你一个人情)
I can take an IOU.

80
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,073
我有种感觉  你善于...
Something tells me you're good...

81
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,000
这样的事
...for it.

82
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:16,075
有没有看到哪儿有梳子?
You haven't found a hairbrush in there, have you?

83
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:18,048
没看到过  抱歉
No. Sorry.

84
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,011
老天  我已经翻遍20只行李箱了
God, I must've looked through 20 suitcases.

85
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:23,025
却一把梳子都找不到 太奇怪了 对吧?
Can't find one. It's weird, right?

86
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:26,009
我意思是 你一定认为每个人都带上梳子了
I mean, you'd think that everyone packs a hairbrush...

87
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:29,093
你没事吧?
You all right?

88
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:32,041
没事  只是有点发烧
Yeah, it's just the heat.

89
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,064
我...我怀孕了
Oh. And I'm pregnant.

90
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:37,011
是这样!
Really?

91
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,070
谢谢
Thanks.

92
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,054
你干什么呢?
What are you doing?

93
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,063
我正在把实用的衣物从没用的衣物中整理出来
I'm sorting the practical clothes from the impractical.

94
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:49,040
能帮忙吗?
Wanna help?

95
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,070
当然
Sure.

96
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:54,049
我可以...我可以问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you something?

97
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,000
当然  问吧
Sure. Shoot.

98
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:58,020
你是双子座?
Are you a Gemini?

99
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:03,024
-是 是的  -我说嘛
-Yeah, I am.  -I thought so.

100
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,036
坐不住  充满热情
Restless. Passionate.

101
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:08,077
你知道  大家都认为占星学是垃圾
Everyone thinks astrology is just a load of crap,

102
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,075
那是因为他们一点儿都不懂
but that's because they don't get it.

103
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:13,021
如果你愿意  我可以把你的星辰八卦算出来
I could do your chart if you wanted.

104
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,001
不愿意就算了
Or not.

105
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,019
双子座
Geminis.

106
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,079
嘿  Jack
Hey, Jack?

107
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,036
你看起来很疲劳  老兄
You look tired, brother.

108
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,065
我没事
I'm fine.

109
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,018
有麻烦了
We've got a problem.

110
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,059
就这些?
That's it?

111
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,074
就这些了
That's it.

112
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:42,054
-有多少?  -18瓶
-How many?  -Eighteen.

113
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,043
大家都还只拿了一点点  以为够用就行了 因为...
People just kinda took what they needed 'cause...

114
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,094
大家都以为救援队马上到...
we were supposed to be rescued.

115
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:50,007
但是没有
But we weren't.

116
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:53,001
如果把它们分了 即使每瓶水对半分
Even if we divided it up,

117
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,059
还是分不到47个人的
it wouldn't be enough for 47 people.

118
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,075
46个
Forty-six.

119
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:57,085
现在只有46个了
There's 46 of us now.

120
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:02,028
如果被他们发现只有这么点水了 他们会失去理智的
If people find out this is all we have, they'll freak out.

121
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,067
上次抓到的那只野猪快吃完了 
The boar's running low.

122
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:06,022
-我们该怎么跟他们说?  -我不知道
-What should we tell them?  -I don't know.

123
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,001
或许我们可以做一些"找水棒"
Make water-finding sticks.

124
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,007
这些水怎么处理?
What should we do with what we got?

125
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,010
我不知道
I don't know.

126
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,040
放在帐篷里 行吧?
We should put it in the tent, yeah?

127
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,096
或许狗可以找到水
Maybe the dog can find water.

128
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,082
最好不要让大家知道这件事
Better if no one knows how little is left.

129
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:22,062
我是说 狗可以找到罐子和炸弹 那它也一定能找到水
Dogs can find pot and bombs, so I'm sure they can find water.

130
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:25,015
如果告诉他们东西都快吃完了 那我们就可以限量供应了
We tell the others we're running low, we can ration it.

131
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:27,067
-那么你决定该...  -我什么事都不会决定
-Then you can decide...  -I'm not deciding anything!

132
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,054
为什么不?
Why not?

133
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:48,077
想进来吗?
You wanna come in?

134
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:01,030
那么...
So...

135
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,019
告诉我 发生了什么事?
You wanna tell me what happened?

136
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,020
几个家伙打了Marc Silverman
A couple of guys jumped Marc Silverman.

137
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:10,045
几个家伙打了Marc Silverman
A couple of guys jumped Marc Silverman.

138
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,071
但他们没有打你
But they didn't jump you.

139
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:16,001
没有
No.

140
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:24,030
今天有个小男孩过来就诊
I had a boy on my table today.

141
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,094
可能比你小一岁  我不清楚
I don't know, maybe a year younger than you.

142
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,001
他心脏很不好
He had a bad heart.

143
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,033
当时情况很糟
It got real hairy, real fast.

144
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:36,046
大家都等着你的老爸做决定
Everybody's looking to your old man to make decisions.

145
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:40,000
我能够作出那样的决定是因为...
And I was able to make those decisions because,

146
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,019
那天快结束的时候
at the end of the day,

147
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,093
男孩死了  接着...
after the boy died,

148
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:47,049
我就洗手  然后...
I was able to wash my hands

149
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:50,017
回家吃晚饭
and come home to dinner,

150
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:53,096
看着弱小的Carol Burnett一开始还笑着 直到我心痛
you know, watch a little Carol Burnett, laugh till my sides hurt.

151
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,096
我怎么能那么做 恩?
And how can I do that?

152
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:00,081
我意思是  即使我失败了
I mean, even when I fail,

153
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:02,070
但我怎么能这么做  Jack?
how do I do that, Jack?

154
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:07,042
这个担子  我承受不起
Because I have what it takes.

155
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:14,020
不要选择  Jack  不要作决定
Don't choose, Jack. Don't decide.

156
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,094
不要想成为一个英雄
You don't wanna be a hero.

157
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,020
不要想着自己能拯救每个人
You don't wanna try and save everyone.

158
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:23,022
因为万一你失败了...
Because when you fail...

159
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:29,097
你真的承受不起
You just don't have what it takes.

160
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,064
为什么不放开我?
Why didn't you leave me?

161
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,066
我在和你说话!
Hey, I'm talking to you.

162
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,095
-以后再说 朋友  -我本可以救她的
-Not now, man.  -I could have made it back.

163
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:53,032
什么  不回答是吧?
What? You're not gonna answer me?

164
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:55,013
我告诉过你放开我的
I told you to leave me.

165
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:56,035
你都快淹死了
You were drowning.

166
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:58,072
你应该救她的
You should've saved her.

167
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,004
我没能救她
But I didn't save her.

168
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:02,084
你也一样不能
And neither did you.

169
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:06,018
你以为你救我  就很高尚了 就是个英雄了?
You think you're all noble and heroic for coming after me?

170
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,026
我没事的
I was fine.

171
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:10,013
你不是这儿唯一知道该怎么做的人 知道吗?
You're not the only one who knows what to do around here.

172
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:11,050
这事归我管
I run a business.

173
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,062
谁叫你救我了 恩?
Who appointed you our savior, huh?

174
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:18,045
谁给你这个权利?
What gives you the right?

175
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:19,071
看着我!
Look at me.

176
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,030
我在和你说话!
Hey, I'm talking to you.

177
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,088
看着我  Jack!
Look at me, Jack.

178
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,078
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

179
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:31,046
你去哪儿?
Hey, where are you going?

180
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,061
爸爸?
Dad?

181
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:28,091
你爸爸又走了  Jack
Your father's gone, Jack.

182
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,068
你听到我说的话了吗?
Did you hear what I said?

183
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:36,076
他走了  Jack
He's gone, Jack.

184
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,064
-他会回来的  -这次和以前不一样
-He'll be back.  -This time it's different.

185
00:13:46,048 --> 00:13:47,077
我要你带他回来
I want you to bring him back.

186
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,056
什么?
What?

187
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:54,061
他已经两个月没和我说过话了  妈妈
He hasn't talked to me in two months.

188
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,038
是你两个月没和他说话
You haven't talked to him in two months.

189
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,045
相信我  他不会让我带他回来的
He doesn't want me to bring him back. Trust me.

190
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,003
让他朋友去找吧
Let one of his friends.

191
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:02,008
他什么朋友都没有了
He doesn't have friends anymore.

192
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:04,031
你怎么会这么想?
Why do you think that is?

193
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,082
他说的很对
He was right about you.

194
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,008
什么很对?
Right about what?

195
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:17,030
-你并不理解他所受到的压力  -我理解
-You don't understand the pressure... -I understand pressure.

196
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:23,048
Jack 求你了 你知道他会出事的
Jack, please, you know how he gets.

197
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:24,097
他不会...
He doesn't...

198
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:28,006
他不会照顾自己 你得追他回来
He won't take care of himself. You have to go after him.

199
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:31,062
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:34,067
我不能
I can't.

201
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,082
"我不能"?
"I can't"?

202
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,043
你没权利说"我不能"
You don't get to say "I can't."

203
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,039
自从你做了那事以后
Not after what you did.

204
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:54,029
把你爸带回来 Jack
You bring your father home, Jack.

205
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:05,055
他去哪了?
Where is he?

206
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,046
澳大利亚
Australia.

207
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:25,041
怎么了?
What's the matter?

208
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,018
那个孕妇摔倒了
That pregnant lady fell down.

209
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,015
-怎么回事?  -她刚刚摔了一交
-What happened?  -She just dropped.

210
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:35,011
一定是发烧引起的
It must be the heat.

211
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,084
-还有呼吸吗?  -我想有的
-Is she breathing?  -I think.

212
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:39,004
快 让她躺里面
Let's get her inside.

213
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:43,036
好的

214
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:46,043
Claire?

215
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:49,006
Claire  亲爱的  醒醒
Claire, honey, wake up.

216
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:51,002
Claire  能听到我说话吗?  Claire?
Claire, can you hear me? Claire?

217
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,080
快  醒醒  快
Come on. Wake up. Come on.

218
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:55,038
快  醒醒吧
Come on. Please, wake up.

219
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,010
快  Claire  能听到我说话吗?
Come on. Claire, can you hear me?

220
00:15:58,022 --> 00:16:00,027
是我  Kate
Hi, it's me. It's Kate.

221
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:01,075
-什么?  -你刚昏过去了
-What...?  -You passed out.

222
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:03,047
不用担心  好吗?
Just take it easy, okay?

223
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,056
她需要水
She needs water.

224
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:06,027
-水  -不要动 好吗?
-Water.  -Don't move, okay?

225
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:09,010
天 太烫了 她发烧了
She's burning up. She's really hot.

226
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:12,050
亲爱的 我想你发烧了  呆这儿不要动 会没事的
Honey, I think you have a fever. You need to stay really still. It's okay.

227
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:15,016
没事的 没事的 放松
Just rest.

228
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:16,015
什么...
What the...?

229
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:18,088
水不见了
The water's gone.

230
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,067
被人偷了
Someone stole it.

231
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,053
医生哪去了?
Where is the doctor?

232
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:28,034
我不知道 大家都找不到他
I don't know. No one can find him.

233
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,022
那些是仅存的水了吗?
Was this the last of the camp's water supply?

234
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,006
是的
Yeah.

235
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,091
把水都放在同一个地方 怎么会这么蠢?!
Keeping it all in one place. Foolish.

236
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,087
我去丛林吧  看看能不能找到水
I can go into the jungle to find fresh water.

237
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:36,090
不要单独一个人去
You're not going alone.

238
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:39,073
要是被人发现水已经没了的话  会很难堪的
When the others find out the water's gone, it's gonna get ugly.

239
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:42,074
要是被他们知道水是被人独吞的
And when they find out that someone pinched it,

240
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,046
那将更加难堪
it's gonna get uglier.

241
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:48,078
我去找水吧
I'll go.

242
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:51,095
营地里需要你们两位 尤其是医生不在的时候
Camp needs you two here. Especially with the doctor gone.

243
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:56,054
而且 我知道去哪儿找
And besides, I know where to look.

244
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:36,075
你在哪儿?
Where are you?
	 
258
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,540
你在哪儿?
Where are you?

245
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:50,052
你到底在哪儿?!
Where are you?

246
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:54,024
服务员说他已经三天没睡过这张床了
The maid says he hasn't used the bed in the past three days.

247
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:03,094
他有没向服务台借车?
Did he rent a car from the concierge?

248
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,024
没有 先生
No, sir.

249
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:09,018
坦白地说  Shephard先生
Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard,

250
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:12,038
我认为你爸根本没租借过车子
I don't think your father rented a car at all.

251
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,086
是吗?  这话怎讲?
Yeah? Why's that?

252
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:18,016
几天前 有人在这儿的旅馆酒吧闹事
There was an incident a few nights ago, here at the hotel bar.

253
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:21,076
我不得不叫保安送你爸回房间
I had to get security to escort your father to his room.

254
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,068
那和租车子有什么关系?
What's that have to do with renting a car?

255
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:28,000
-很抱歉 先生...  -说吧 和租车有什么关系?
-Sorry. I shouldn't have... -What's that have to do with renting a car?

256
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:31,074
Shephard先生 我认为悉尼的租车公司....
Mr. Shepherd, I don't think any rental agent in Sydney

257
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,011
不会借车给你爸这样情况的人
would lease your father a car in his condition.

258
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,044
我爸是主刀医师
My father is the chief of surgery.

259
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:39,084
当然 先生 我道歉
Of course, sir. I apologize.

260
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:49,003
他钱包落这了
He left his wallet.

261
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,027
谁会不带钱包呢?
Who leaves a wallet?

262
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,080
我想你还是报警吧  Shephard先生
Perhaps you should talk to the police, Mr. Shephard.

263
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:03,061
你到底在哪?
Where are you?

264
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:56,097
抓住我的手
Take my hand.

265
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,085
你没事吧?
You okay?

266
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:55,035
-我已经多久....  -几个小时了
-How long have I...?  -A couple of hours.

267
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:56,065
喝吧
Here.

268
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:00,074
水不多 但我们只能找到这些了
It's not much, but it's what we have.

269
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:04,063
放松就行了
Just relax.

270
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,063
你得照顾到里面这小家伙 是吧?
You have to think about the little one now.

271
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:09,090
谢谢你给我水喝 Charlie
Thanks for the water, Charlie.

272
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,068
要不是被哪个狗杂种偷了 水还会更多
There'd be more if some git hadn't nicked it.

273
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,094
-Jack回来了吗?  -没有
-Is Jack back yet?  -No.

274
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:20,090
没人看到过他
No one's seen him.

275
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:27,038
但用不着担心
But I wouldn't worry.

276
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,086
好好先生Locke已经去丛林给你找水了
Good ol' Mr. Locke's gone into the jungle to get some water for you.

277
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:33,096
很好  我们唯一的猎手能够搞到吃的
Great. Our only hunter's gonna get eaten

278
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:36,048
但这不能说明他也能为孕妇搞到水啊
just so he can get the pregnant girl some more water.

279
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,065
这我不担心 亲爱的  我意思是 你能告诉我...
I wouldn't worry. You tell me,

280
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:40,043
在黑暗的小巷里 你最希望碰到谁?
who would you rather meet in a dark alley,

281
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:43,097
不管出现什么 至少那老头有400把刀子?
whatever's out there, or that geezer with his 400 knives?

282
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:46,064
我意思是 谁会裹上400把刀子?
I mean, who packs 400 knives?

283
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:50,059
对我个人而言 行李箱内最多放上200-300把刀子
Personally, I can only have space for 200. Three hundred, at most.

284
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:58,049
他们什么时候来救我们?
When are they gonna rescue us?

285
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,080
快了
Soon.

286
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,088
谢谢你  Charlie.
Thanks, Charlie.

287
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,036
谢什么?
For what?

288
00:23:08,084 --> 00:23:11,055
这儿的人似乎都不把我放在眼里
People don't seem to look me in the eye here.

289
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:13,070
我想我很怕他们
I think I scare them.

290
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:20,086
这个孩子  我就像个有责任在身的定事炸弹 就等着爆炸
The baby. It's like I'm this time bomb of responsibility just waiting to go off.

291
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,051
你不必怕我
You don't scare me.

292
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:39,093
那对中国夫妇有水
The Chinese people have water.

293
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,083
你哪里弄来的?
Where did you get this?

294
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:49,037
你哪里弄来的?
Where did you get this?

295
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:55,005
-你...哪里...弄...  -她听不懂的 Sayid
-Where did you get...?  -She doesn't understand, Sayid.

296
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,006
她能理解我的意思
She understands me.

297
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,086
是你偷的水吗?
Did you steal this water?

298
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,003
好了 大家和气点 行不? 有话好好说 好吗?
Okay, just take it easy. All right? We just want to talk. All right?

299
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,093
这本来有水的  是你的吗?
This had water in it. Is it yours?

300
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,009
谁给你的?
Who gave you this?

301
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,037
我没看到过水
I don't see the water.

302
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:29,002
那又如何?
And?

303
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:31,024
你追着他不放  他还是不会给你什么的
You go after him now, he'll give you nothing.

304
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,068
但如果你再等等
But if you wait...

305
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:35,093
兔子的尾巴总会露出来的
a rat will always lead you to its hole.

306
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:03,012
-时机终于来了  -干什么?
-Well, it's about time.  -For what?

307
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:05,029
四年前的生日上  我就许下了这个愿
I made this birthday wish four years ago.

308
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,037
水在哪?
Where's the water

309
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,057
这样好多了
This is better.

310
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,059
放开我
Get off of me.

311
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:17,082
快把水拿出来!
Give us the water now!

312
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:19,036
你要是再敢碰我 嗯?
Yeah, touch me again, huh?

313
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:21,035
还真以为是我偷的水?
You really think I stoled your damn water?

314
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:23,017
我们都知道你给了那韩国人两瓶水
You gave two bottles to the Koreans.

315
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:24,087
我没有给过任何人 任何东西
I don't give nothing to nobody.

316
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,025
不在这儿
It's not here.

317
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:30,023
我仅存的一瓶水和Miyagi先生交换鱼用了
I traded Mr. Miyagi the last of my water for a fish he caught.

318
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:32,042
我们以最"原始的"方式做交换
We worked it out caveman-style.

319
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:34,006
你把最后的两瓶水给他了?
You gave him your last two bottles?

320
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:35,093
水又没什么价值的 斑点女
Water has no value, freckles.

321
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:37,095
迟早会下雨的
It's gonna rain sooner or later.

322
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,038
嘿嘿  我乐观吧
And, hell, I'm an optimist.

323
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:56,009
你忘了样东西
You forgot something.

324
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:59,064
就当你是这儿新上任的镇长
Seeing as you're the new sheriff in town,

325
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:01,024
带这个会看起来正式一些
might as well make it official.

326
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:11,003
他们怎么样了?
How are they?

327
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,081
大伙们?
The others.

328
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:15,053
口渴
Thirsty.

329
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,018
饥饿
Hungry.

330
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:19,074
等着被解救
Waiting to be rescued.

331
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,082
他们需要有个人告诉他们该怎么做
And they need someone to tell them what to do.

332
00:26:28,076 --> 00:26:29,055
我不能
I can't.

333
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:30,088
为什么不能?
Why can't you?

334
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,047
因为我不是个领袖
Because I'm not a leader.

335
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:34,041
但他们都把你当领袖了
And yet they all treat you like one.

336
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,092
我不知道该怎么帮他们
I don't know how to help them.

337
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:38,045
如果我失败了
I'll fail. I'll...

338
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:42,021
我承受不起
I don't have what it takes.

339
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:46,080
你为什么来这儿 Jack?
Why are you out here, Jack?

340
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:51,046
我以为我要疯了
I think I'm going crazy.

341
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,056
不  你不会疯的
Oh, you're not going crazy.

342
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,064
不会吗?
No?

343
00:26:54,094 --> 00:26:56,081
不 疯子是不会知道 自己就要疯了
Crazy people don't know they're going crazy.

344
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,032
他们都认为自己清醒的很
They think they're getting saner.

345
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,026
那么...
So...

346
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:05,028
你来这儿干什么?
why are you out here?

347
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,071
追东西
I'm chasing something.

348
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:13,078
应该说是人
Someone.

349
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,033
哦  白兔子
Ah. The White Rabbit.

350
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:19,053
"爱丽丝奇境记"
Alice in Wonderland.

351
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:20,064
是的
Yeah,

352
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,032
"仙境" 因为我追的人
Wonderland, because who I'm chasing...

353
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,081
他并不在这儿
he's not there.

354
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:28,006
-但你看到他了?  -是的
-But you see him?  -Yes.

355
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:30,050
但就是找不到他
But he's not there.

356
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:34,073
如果我来找你  说同样的话
And if I came to you and said the same thing,

357
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:37,054
作为一个医生 你会给我怎样的解释?
then what would your explanation be, as a doctor?

358
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:39,029
我会说  这是一种幻觉
I'd call it a hallucination.

359
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:42,077
严重脱水和过度的压力导致的
Result of dehydration. Post-traumatic stress.

360
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,092
过去的一星期 我每天晚上睡觉不超过两个小时  就这样
Not getting more than two hours of sleep a night. All of the above.

361
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,063
很好 这就可以说这都是你的幻觉了
All right. Then you're hallucinating.

362
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:50,080
要是你不是呢?
But what if you're not?

363
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,090
那大家都有麻烦了
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.

364
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,078
我是一个普通人 Jack
I'm an ordinary man, Jack.

365
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:03,019
肉 土豆 我生活在真实的世界里
Meat and potatoes. I live in the real world.

366
00:28:03,044 --> 00:28:04,086
我从不相信...
I'm not a big believer in...

367
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:06,067
魔力
magic.

368
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:11,076
但这个地方不一样
But this place is different.

369
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:13,086
它很特别
It's special.

370
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:19,023
其它人不想谈论 是因为它吓着他们了
The others don't want to talk about it because it scares them.

371
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,004
但大家心里都很清楚 都感觉得到
But we all know it. We all feel it.

372
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,090
白兔子是你的幻觉吗?
Is your White Rabbit a hallucination?

373
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,003
有可能是
Probably.

374
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:32,000
但要是这儿发生的每件事
But what if everything that happened here

375
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:34,035
都有理可寻 那会怎样?
happened for a reason?

376
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:38,025
要是你追的那个人真的存在 会怎样?
What if this person that you're chasing is really here?

377
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:40,096
不可能
That's impossible.

378
00:28:41,028 --> 00:28:43,025
即使是真的 我们也不要说它是
Even if it is, let's say it's not.

379
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:49,062
要是我抓住他了 结果会怎样?
Then what happens when I catch him?

380
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:51,044
我不知道
I don't know.

381
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:56,036
但当我环顾这岛
But I've looked into the eye of this island,

382
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:58,005
我所看到的...
and what I saw...

383
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:03,041
是如此的美丽
...was beautiful.

384
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:13,003
等等 你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

385
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:14,037
多找些水
To find some more water.

386
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,023
我和你一块儿去
I'll come with you.

387
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:17,060
不 既然有了开始 你就应当弄出个结果来
No. You need to finish what you started.

388
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:20,025
为什么?
Why?

389
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:24,057
因为只有当一个领袖知道往哪儿走的时候 他才是个真正的领袖
Because a leader can't lead until he knows where he's going.

390
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,042
警察是在国王路口的巷子里找到他的
Police found him in an alley in Kings Cross.

391
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,095
经扫描显示 他的血液酒精浓度偏高
Our tox screen showed a blood alcohol content

392
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:04,047
就是说 像他那样体型的人 很可能会发生心肌梗塞
which, for a man of his size, probably brought on myocardial infarction:

393
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:07,008
相当程度的 致命的心脏病发作
a sizable and fatal heart attack.

394
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:43,020
是他
That's him.

395
00:33:19,036 --> 00:33:26,024
直飞新加坡的125航班将于9:40起飞 请从14号门登机........
Oceanic Airlines, flight 125 nonstop to Singapore, leaving from gate 14...

396
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,084
不能放飞机上?你什么意思?
You won't put it on the plane?

397
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,039
很抱歉 Shephard先生 但我们的登机规定...
I'm sorry. Our policy is that...

398
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:32,036
是你必须有合理的文件说明
the body must have proper documentation.

399
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,048
-没有回旋的余地...  -没有回旋余地
-There is no latitude to...  -No latitude?

400
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,025
-没有回旋余地  -没有合理的文件说明...
-No latitude?  -Without the proper documents...

401
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:39,050
听着 你不能这么对我  我已经准备好走了
You can't do this to me. I'm ready to go now.

402
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,070
-或许用其它护送....  -不!
-Perhaps another carrier...  -No!

403
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:50,051
你听我说 好吗?
I want you to listen to me. Okay?

404
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:52,018
我需要你的帮助
Because I'm asking you a favor.

405
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:56,048
Chrissy  我穿着和你一样的西装 站在你面前
Chrissy, I'm standing in front of you in the same suit

406
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:59,083
这么穿 是因为我要去参加我爸的葬礼 我请求你帮我个忙
that I'm wearing to my father's funeral, and I'm asking you a favor.

407
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,096
我必须在16小时内赶到L.A.X.
In 16 hours, I need to land at LAX.

408
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:08,054
我必须得让灵柩通过海关 因为那儿将会有灵车等着
And I need that coffin to clear customs because there's gonna be a hearse waiting there.

409
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:13,006
我需要灵车载着我和棺材去墓地 为什么呢?
And I need that hearse to take me and that coffin to a cemetery. Why, Chrissy?

410
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:17,013
Chrissy 为什么我不能作好安排 带他回家 然后举办葬礼?
Why can't I bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements?

411
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,074
为什么我要这么急?是因为...
Why can't I really take my time with it? Because...

412
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,050
因为我必须得做好
Because I need it to be done.

413
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:25,052
我得尽快结束这一切
I need it to be over.

414
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:29,070
我只是...
I just...

415
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,072
我得埋葬我的父亲
I need to bury my father.

416
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,050
嘿  Claire
Hey, Claire.

417
00:36:09,018 --> 00:36:11,013
-你哪里弄...  -嘘...嘘....
-How did you get...?  -Shh

418
00:36:13,027 --> 00:36:14,026
你哪儿弄来的?
Where'd you get that?

419
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,025
这就是小偷!
Here's your thief.

420
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:18,088
-他把水藏哪了?  -我不知道
-Where'd he hide it?  -I don't know.

421
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:20,064
这杂种居然有三瓶水
This wanker had three bottles.

422
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:22,047
你为什么要这么做 小子 嗯?
Why did you do it, pretty boy?

423
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:25,007
我坐在帐篷里面
It was just sitting in the tent.

424
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:27,015
-Jack刚刚离开  -Claire会死的
-Jack just took off.  -Claire could've died.

425
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,073
我打算马上给她水的 但是我就是控制不住自己
I tried to give her some sooner, but it just got out of hand.

426
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,063
-没人懂我意思吗! -发生什么事了?
-No one would've understood.  -What is going on?

427
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:34,097
总得有人负起责任来吧  水已经供应不了多久了!
Someone had to take responsibility. It would've never lasted!

428
00:36:35,003 --> 00:36:36,026
放开他!
Leave him alone!

429
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:50,023
已经6天了
It's been six days,

430
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:53,038
可我们还在等...
and we're all still waiting.

431
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,047
等着有人来救我们
Waiting for someone to come.

432
00:36:58,021 --> 00:36:59,027
但要是他们不来呢?
But what if they don't?

433
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,051
我们不要再等了
We have to stop waiting.

434
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:14,028
我们得把事情想想清楚了
We need to start figuring things out.

435
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:18,085
今天早上  一位女士游泳死掉了
A woman died this morning just going for a swim.

436
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:22,041
他曾努力的去救她 可现在你们却围攻他一个人?
And he tried to save her, and now you're about to crucify him?

437
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:27,018
我们不能这么做
We can't do this.

438
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:30,079
只为自己着想的人是没有用的
"Every man for himself" is not gonna work.

439
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:36,000
该是组织起来的时候了
It's time to start organizing.

440
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:39,025
我们该好好想想  如何才能生存下去
We need to figure out how we're gonna survive here.

441
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,008
现在  我已经找到水了
Now I found water,

442
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,017
淡水 山谷往上就是
fresh water, up in the valley.

443
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:49,077
我会先带一队人上去取水
I'll take a group in at first light.

444
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:53,030
如果你不想来  那还可以想想其它办法
If you don't wanna come, then find another way to contribute.

445
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,093
上星期  我们中的大部分人都还是形同陌路
Last week, most of us were strangers.

446
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,079
但现在大家都走在一起了
But we're all here now.

447
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:07,064
天知道我们会在这儿呆多久
And God knows how long we're gonna be here.

448
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,048
如果大家不能和平相处...
But if we can't live together,

449
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:18,027
我们都会孤独的死去
we're gonna die alone.

450
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060
谢谢

451
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,060
今天你把水给了我

452
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
那是丈夫应该做的

453
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:05,029
告诉我  那感觉如何?
So how's it feel?

454
00:39:07,006 --> 00:39:08,020
什么感觉如何?
How's what feel?

455
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:12,052
在人人痛恨的名单之首取代了我的位置
Taking my place at the top of everyone's most hated list.

456
00:39:17,003 --> 00:39:18,011
很不好受  是吧?
Sucks, don't it?

457
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,036
谢谢
Thanks.

458
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,074
今天去哪了  Jack?
So where were you today, Jack?

459
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:51,074
有些事  我不得不去解决
Just had to take care of a few things.

460
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,056
你就只能告诉我这些 恩?
That's all I'm gonna get, huh?

461
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:03,076
我父亲去世了
My father died.

462
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:06,004
在悉尼
In Sydney.

463
00:40:10,098 --> 00:40:11,087
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

464
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:17,014
是的...
Yeah.

465
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:20,057
我也很抱歉
I'm sorry too.

466
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:37,000
