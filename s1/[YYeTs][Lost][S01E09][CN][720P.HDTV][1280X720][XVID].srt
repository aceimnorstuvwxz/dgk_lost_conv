3
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:16,018
哇哦! 轻点  蠢驴
Ow! Easy, jackass.

4
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:18,085
要我轻点就别再抱怨 我得给你换绷带
You want it easy, quit moaning. I got to change these bandages.

5
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:20,081
好  但别把我的皮也扯下来了
Try not taking my skin off with them.

6
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:27,047
我把你映衬得怎样  Quinn医生?  缓解你良心上的不安了?
How'd I score the house call, Dr.Quinn? Trying to ease your conscience?

7
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:29,009
我良心上没什么不安  谢谢
My conscience is fine, thanks.

8
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
当然  有什么事情会让你内疚?
Of course, what have you got to feel guilty about?

9
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:37,002
我是说  你让那个该死的阿拉伯人折磨我  自己却站在一旁观看
I mean, you just let that damn Arab torture me.Stood by and watched.

10
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:40,002
现在又想修补你我之间的关系  给自己买去天堂的飞机票?
Now you figure you'll patch me up and buy you a ticket into heaven?

11
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:42,015
你在这儿的唯一原因是...
Only reason you're here...

12
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:45,015
我在这儿是因为  没有一个人想和你扯上关系
I'm here because no one else wants anything to do with you.

13
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,045
她会的
She does.

14
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:00,008
自己换绷带去
Change your own bandages.

15
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,039
找人呢?  还是欣赏风景?
Looking for someone,or just admiring the view?

16
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:19,043
Sayid独自离开已经两天了
It's been two days since Sayid took off on his own.

17
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:22,048
我一直期待着能看到他回来
I keep thinking I'm gonna see him.

18
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,056
等到他找到要找的东西后  他会回来的...
He'll come when he's found what he's looking for,

19
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:27,044
-那个法国人的求救传输信号  -他不是去找东西
-The French transmission.  -He wasn't looking for anything.

20
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:30,049
他离开是因为之前发生的事
He left because of what happened.

21
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:32,028
-是因为他自己的行为  -那是个意外
-for what he did  -It was an accident.

22
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:34,099
意外却发生在你折磨人的时候 Jack
Well, accidents happen when you torture people, Jack.

23
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,050
Sayid是个训练有素的军人  Kate
Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate.

24
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,042
他会照顾好自己
He can take care of himself.

25
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,039
有人吗?
Hello?

26
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,006
有人吗?
Hello?

27
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,009
把他赶出去!  他在喝我们的水
Ew! Get him out of there! He's drinking our water.

28
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,025
那儿怎么了?
What's going on out there?

29
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,013
你知道  和往常一样
You know, the usual.

30
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:58,047
为了点小事情争来争去
People yelling at each other.

31
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,080
医生  你觉得这是...  这是...
Doc, what do you think this is, this...

32
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:04,097
这皮疹?  很糟是吗?  是那种热带病?
...this rash? It's bad, right? Some kind of a tropical disease?

33
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,039
-是麻疹  -那是什么?
-It's hives.  -What's that?

34
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,006
毒葛之类的东西吗?
Is that like poison ivy?

35
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,048
这是一种很普通的皮疹  有时候是由于热和压力引起的
It's a common rash, sometimes brought on by heat and stress.

36
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:14,011
放松就行了
Just try to relax.

37
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,090
-都弄干净了  -好
-It'll clear up.  -Right.

38
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,015
不要老想着它
Try to keep your mind off it.

39
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:20,028
好的  这是什么?  芦荟吗?
Okay.What is that? Is that like aloe?

40
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,095
用来防晒的吗?  还是其它用途?
Isn't that for sunburn or something?

41
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:25,058
"不要老想着它"?
"Try to keep your mind off it"?

42
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,095
那家伙除了给自己增加压力  还能干什么?
What else has that guy got to do but stress?

43
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,058
我事情已经够多了  没必要连忧郁症也治吧
I have enough without having to treat hypochondriacs.

44
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:33,071
是  那正是我要说的
That's like my point, man.

45
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,096
大家都备受煎熬
We're all fried.

46
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,038
我是说
I mean

47
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,034
你去看过那儿的人了吗?
have you taken a look at everybody out there?

48
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,072
每个人都很焦虑
Everybody's way tense.

49
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:46,039
老兄  我想说的是  我们最好能干点什么...
Dude, I'm just saying,it... it'd be sweet if we could have...

50
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,098
我不知道  至少干点什么
I don't know, something to do.

51
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:52,023
我们都还活着  Hurley
We're surviving here, Hurley.

52
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:55,015
那才是我要干的事  保证每个人都活着
And that's my main concern, is keeping us alive.

53
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:59,007
事情可能会变得更糟
Things could be worse.

54
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,003
怎么变?
How?

55
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,096
Alex在哪?
Where is Alex?

56
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,049
什么?
What?

57
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:47,028
你是谁?
Who are you?

58
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:54,017
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you are talking about.

59
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,051
Alex在哪?
Where is Alex?

60
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,043
求你  不要....
Please, let's not...

61
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:11,027
-Alex在哪?  -我不认识什么Alex
-Where is Alex?  -I don't know any Alex.

62
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,011
住手!
Stop!

63
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:26,062
你要我住手  Flahn?

64
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,087
那就回答我的问题

65
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:37,013
我可以折磨你一整天

66
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:44,063
我向你保证  我们已经了解了事情真相

67
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,068
但我要你承认

68
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:52,089
你就不会再遭受任何痛苦
And all the pain will stop.

69
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:57,056
你的什叶派教徒朋友向我们暗示  你参与了爆炸事件
Your Shiite friends have already implicated you in the bombing.

70
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:04,074
是你把爆炸装置安装在政党总部  是不是?
You planted the device in the headquarters!

71
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:06,032
你杀了两个士兵!
You killed two soldiers!

72
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,028
承认吧
Confess it

73
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:13,012
承认的话  或许你可以保住你的小命  我们要你的手就够了
and perhaps it will only cost you your hands instead of your life.

74
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,021
他什么都不知道
He doesn't know anything.

75
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:25,009
-你的消息有错  -也许吧
-Your sources were wrong.  -Perhaps.

76
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:28,009
但那不是关键  是吧?
But that's really not the point, is it?

77
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,039
你在那儿把自己掌控的非常好
You handled yourself well in there.

78
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:32,047
是吗?
Did I?

79
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:36,085
我已经提交了你的调职申请  如果你仍想调职的话
I put in for your reassignment to intelligence division, If you still wish it.

80
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,090
是的  长官  非常想
Yes, sir. Very much so.

81
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:43,073
很好  只有我们两个人的时候  不用叫我"长官"
Good. But stop calling me "sir" when it's just the two of us.

82
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,090
你是我的上级指挥  Omar...至少现在还是
You're my superior officer, Omar.

83
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,041
在你未调职之前  我很高兴你这么叫
For now.And I'll enjoy it while it lasts.

84
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,058
那倒提醒了我  Sayid
That reminds me,

85
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,066
除了你越来越重的责任
in addition to your increased responsibilities,

86
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,042
官位的提升和你的能力很相称
a promotion is commensurate with your move.

87
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:01,079
如果你不会怀念当一位审讯官的话
That is, if you won't miss being a communications officer.

88
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,013
我愿意作出那样的牺牲
I am willing to make that sacrifice.

89
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,005
很好
Good.

90
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:19,044
这是什么?
Yo. What's this?

91
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:22,011
在丛林里找到的  一定是飞机上掉下来的
They must have fallen from the plane.

92
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:24,069
你们昨晚在丛林里干什么?
What are you doing in the jungle at night?

93
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:25,073
打猎的好时间
Best time to hunt.

94
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,061
Ethan有些经验
Ethan here has some experience.

95
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:30,066
他发现了一些足迹  看起来像兔子的或其它啮齿动物
He spotted tracks that might be a rabbit or some other rodent.

96
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,091
啮齿动物  妙极了
Rodent. Yum.

97
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:35,033
我想人们已经吃厌了野猪肉
People are getting tired of boar meat.

98
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,070
你说对了
You got that right.

99
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,038
好  我看看
All right, well,I'll take a look at these,

100
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:43,054
看有没用的着东西
See if there's anything useful.

101
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,034
好
Okay.

102
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,023
Locke先生
Mr. Locke.

103
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:05,077
你还要回去打猎吗?
Are you going back out to hunt?

104
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,032
再打一会儿
For a bit.

105
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:08,069
我可以一起去吗?  我是说...
Can I go with you? I mean,

106
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,082
我想向你学习怎么做你做的事
I just want to learn how to do what you do.

107
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,082
Walt!

108
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,053
我只是...  我只是和Locke先生谈谈关于....
I was... I was talking to Mr. Locke about...

109
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:18,062
我知道你在干什么  不可能的事  回到床上来
I know what you're doing. Not gonna happen, man. Get back to bed.

110
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:27,055
老兄...
Whoa, dude...

111
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,056
请听我说!
Please just listen to me!

112
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:42,060
我说了很多遍了  我不认识Alex!
I keep telling you I don't know who Alex is!

113
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,002
我是一个飞机失事的幸存者
I'm a survivor of a plane crash.

114
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:48,023
偶然在海滩边发现了这根绳索
I found the wire on the beach.

115
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,099
就沿着绳索走过来了
I followed it.

116
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:53,011
我想这或许和...
I thought it might have something to do with

117
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,028
和我们接收到的求救信号有关
a transmission we picked up on a receiver.

118
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,054
一个留言  一个求救信号
A recording, a mayday

119
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:03,083
是一个法国女子的声音  已经重复循环了16年了
with a French woman repeating on a loop for 16 years.

120
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,035
16年
Sixteen years.

121
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:29,061
真有那么长吗?
Has it really been that long?

122
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,086
你...
You.

123
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:37,066
你会碰巧收到了我的求救信号?
You just happened to hear my distress call?

124
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,029
我知道你是什么样的人
I know what you are.

125
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,065
Rousseau

126
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:13,040
-你怎么知道我的名字?  -我读的
-How do you know my name?  -I read it.

127
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,099
那儿  在夹克衫上
There, on the jacket.

128
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,016
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

129
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,070
那些电池...
Those batteries

130
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,058
还不足以产生如此多的能量
wouldn't be able to produce enough power

131
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:28,050
来传输一个历经这么多年的求救信号
to transmit your distress call all these years.

132
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,063
是其它地方传输的信号
Broadcasts from somewhere else.

133
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,067
但被他们控制了
But they control it now.

134
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,067
他们?
They?

135
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,043
你
You.

136
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:40,039
以及其它像你一样的人
And the others like you.

137
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:46,010
我不知道你对我怎么想的  我已经告诉过你了
I... I don't know who you think I am. I've already told you.

138
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:47,085
-我不是....  -Sayid?
-I am not...  -Sayid?

139
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,007
你怎么知道我的...
How...?

140
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:55,003
我的名字在我的夹克衫上  你的名字在你带来的信上
My name was on a jacket. Yours is on the envelope you carry.

141
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,099
她是谁?
Who is she?

142
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,020
照片中的女子
The woman in the photographs.

143
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:08,079
Nadia

144
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:11,088
她叫Nadia
Her name is Nadia.

145
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:17,042
我们不能直接把 Noor Abed Jazeem 和爆炸事件联系起来
We cannot tie Noor Abed Jazeem to the bombing,

146
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,030
但我们知道她效忠什么样的人
but we know her sympathies.

147
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:22,093
她是一个众人皆知的  库尔德人和什叶派起义者的联系人
She's a known associate of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.

148
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:25,068
你认为她知道谁策划了  这起爆炸事件?
She knows who orchestrated the bombing?

149
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:29,002
我的朋友  那就是你要去搞清楚的
That, my friend,is exactly what you will find out.

150
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,007
Noor Abed Jazeem

151
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:41,041
我要问你些问题
I'm going to ask you some questions.

152
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:44,083
如果你拒绝合作  我会对你动手  明白吗?
If you refuse to cooperate, I'm going to hurt you.

153
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,087
没人叫我Noor, Sayid
Nobody calls me Noor, Sayid.

154
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,087
你们所有人都应该知道的
You of all people should know that.

155
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,063
什么?
What?

156
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,088
你不记得我了?
You don't remember me?

157
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:06,026
曾在操场上把你推进泥浆里的  小女孩现在变化有这么大吗?
Am I so different from the girl in the schoolyard who used to push you in the mud?

158
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,098
Nadia

159
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,048
还有你妈妈告诉我妈妈  "为什么你非要选中小Sayid?"
And your mother would tell my mother, "Why must you pick on little Sayid?"

160
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:20,011
我回答  "因为他忽视我"
And I'd answer, "Because he ignores me."

161
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:26,024
你得到大家足够的关注  家里又有钱还有...
You had enough attention, with your family's wealth and...

162
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,004
你很迷人
your charm.

163
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:31,058
很少有小孩子关注这种事情
Such things matter little to children.

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,088
但你总是显得很老成  是不是  Sayid?
But then, you always were older than your years,weren't you, Sayid?

165
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:42,038
我还没老成到能理解  "把我推到泥浆里"算是一种喜欢的暗示
Not old enough to understand that being pushed was a sign of affection.

166
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,089
如今你背叛了你的国家
Now you're a traitor to your country.

167
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,077
告诉我你对爆炸事件了解多少  Nadia
Tell me what you know about the bombing, Nadia.

168
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,099
告诉我  否则  我发誓我一定会伤害你
Tell me, or I swear I will hurt you.

169
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,028
我知道  Sayid
Hmm. Oh, I know, Sayid.

170
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:07,074
这不是我第一次被共和卫队审问了
This is not my first interrogation by the Republican Guard.

171
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,025
这就是他们在我身上扑浓酸的地方
This is where they burned me with acid.

172
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:13,021
他们用钻头在我的掌心钻孔
They pierced my hands with a drill.

173
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,058
你想看看我的脚底吗?
Would you like to see the soles of my feet?

174
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:17,059
那是他们把皮扯去的地方
Where they flayed the skin off?

175
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,018
这些都是你的朋友的手艺
These are handiworks of your friends.

176
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:26,068
我曾经却还发誓效忠这些人
The people you swear allegiance to.

177
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:30,039
如果你是清白的  我很抱歉
If you were innocent, I'm sorry.

178
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,035
但这起爆炸事件事关重大
But this bombing is a different matter.

179
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:38,052
-Nadia...  -干吧  Sayid
-Nadia...  -Go on, Sayid.

180
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:40,065
干你的工作
Do your work.

181
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,090
我什么都不会跟你说的
I'm not going to tell you anything.

182
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,012
那我就动手了
Then I'm going to hurt you.

183
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:49,079
我知道
I know.

184
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,091
你有子弹疤痕
You have a bullet wound.

185
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,079
我曾是个军人
I was a soldier.

186
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,054
曾是?
You were?

187
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,001
现在还是?
And are you still?

188
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,009
那已经是很久前的事了
It was a long time ago.

189
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:16,006
多讲些她的事
Tell me more about her,the woman.

190
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,027
Nadia

191
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,078
Alex... 他是谁?
Alex... who is he?

192
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,066
我无聊死了!
I'm bored.

193
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:31,091
我可以带Vincent去海边吗?
Can I take Vincent to the beach?

194
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:34,083
我过会儿带你去  小子
Um... I'll take you later.

195
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,004
我处理点事情
I'm in the middle of something.

196
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,050
但实在没事可干
But there's nothing to do.

197
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:39,092
你得想些事做做  知道我的意思吗?
Well, you got to figure out stuff to do.

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,067
你得给自己找些娱乐节目
You got to find a way to entertain yourself.

199
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:47,009
拜托  拜托  我知道我看到了
Come on. Come on. I know I saw it.

200
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,009
好的
Yes.

201
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:51,068
Hurley...

202
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:53,002
等等  伙计  我很忙
Hold on, man. I'm busy.

203
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:56,044
老兄  我能借下这个吗?
Dude, can I borrow this?

204
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:57,056
-什么?  -谢谢
-What?  -Thanks, man.

205
00:16:57,098 --> 00:16:59,040
Hurley  你要干什么?
What are you doing?

206
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:07,024
那么说你收到了我的信号
So you heard my transmission,

207
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,074
过来找我  寻求答案
Came looking for me, for answers.

208
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:11,045
我不知道你还活着
I didn't know you were alive.

209
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,012
还在说谎
Still lying.

210
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:15,020
-我没说谎  -说谎!
-I'm not lying.  -Lies!

211
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:19,042
像那些什么飞机失事啦  你存活了 还有其它幸存者啦
Like this plane crash that you survived.There were others?

212
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,021
-40多个人  -那为什么你会独自一个人?
-More than 40.  -Then why are you alone?

213
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,005
-我离开了他们  -为什么?
-I left them.  -Why?

214
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,018
有...
There was...

215
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:33,060
我干了一些...
I did something.

216
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,019
一些我感到羞耻的事
Something I'm ashamed of.

217
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:46,015
Nadia... 你也离开了她?
And Nadia... you left her too?

218
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,082
她不在飞机上
She wasn't on the plane.

219
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,083
她死了
She's dead.

220
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,087
因为我
Because of me.

221
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,010
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

222
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,028
我给你看些东西
I want to show you something.

223
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,016
看  汇合处在这
See, this junction here

224
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:40,066
把一部分水引导到几个悬空的盆子
reroutes some of the spring's water flow into suspended basins.

225
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:43,042
水从几个洞流出来  你就能洗澡了
Pop in some holes, you got showers.

226
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,029
这样就可以把饮用水隔离开来了
You keep the drinking water separate.

227
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:50,010
这是... 你画的?
This is... You drew this?

228
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,002
早些时候我是个艺术家
I was an artist in a previous life.

229
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,039
我还以为你是个建筑师
I thought you were in construction.

230

孤岛高尔夫公开赛
Island Open.

237
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:15,058
什么?
What?

238
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:17,062
现在有两个洞
It's two holes, for now.

239
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,000
3个标准杆  无须等待
Three par, and no waiting.

240
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:23,096
Hurley  你建了个高尔夫球场?
Hurley... You built a golf course?

241
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:27,043
那些富佬向来飞到热带岛屿打球
Rich idiots fly to tropical islands to whack balls around.

242
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:29,026
我们有很多事要做  老兄
All the stuff we got to deal with, man,

243
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:32,001
原来你的时间都浪费在这儿了?
this is what you've been wasting time on?

244
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,043
伙计  听着
Dudes, listen.

245
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:35,002
我们的生活糟透了
Our lives suck.

246
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:37,044
每个人的神经都绷的紧紧的
Nerves are stretched to the max.

247
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,094
我是说  我们迷失在了一个岛上
I mean, we're lost on an island,

248
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,023
躲避野猪还有怪兽...
running from boars and monsters...

249
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:45,078
还有反常的北极熊!
Freakin' polar bears!

250
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:46,095
北极熊?
Polar bears?

251
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,066
你没听说北极熊?
You didn't hear about the polar bear?

252
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:50,087
听着  我要说的是如果  我们真被困在这儿了
If we're stuck here,

253
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:53,041
光活着也是不办法啊
then just surviving's not gonna cut it.

254
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,095
我们需要放松  你明白吗?
We need some kind of relief.

255
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,029
我们得找些我们可以...
We need some way that we can...

256
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,037
你知道  娱乐方式
...you know, have fun.

257
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,046
对  娱乐
That's right, fun.

258
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:05,001
否则  傻等着另一件坏事的发生  我们会疯掉的
Or we're gonna go crazy, waiting for the next bad thing to happen.

259
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:14,077
这是个音乐盒  但坏掉了
It's a music box, but it's broken.

261
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:19,094
有很长一段时间了
...for a long time.

00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:24,032
这是我爱人送给我的 作为结婚周年纪念的礼物
It was a gift from my love for our anniversary.

263
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,086
你是说Alex
You mean Alex.

264
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,061
Robert

265
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,058
在这儿的头几年 这东西成了我最大的安慰
It was such a comfort to me the first few years here.

266
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:39,008
我可以帮你修好
I could fix it for you.

267
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:43,021
如果你能给我的手松绑  我能帮你检查一下
I could take a look at it if you freed my hands.

268
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:49,088
我对机械类的东西很在行
I'm fairly good with mechanical things.

269
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:54,039
我需要我的手...
I'll need my hands.

270
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:04,036
照片后面写的是什么?
What is written on the back of your photograph?

271
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:06,011
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

272
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:09,011
她写的还是你写的?
Did she write it, or did you?

273
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:15,008
或许你不想告诉我  因为有太多的痛苦
Perhaps you don't want to tell me because it causes too much pain.

274
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:22,096
Rousseau...

275
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,080
你不必那么做的
You don't need to do that.

276
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,064
-这是个问题  老兄  -是的
-This is a problem, man.  -Yeah.

277
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:41,072
我是说  我知道该怎么做  但...
I mean, I know what I'd do, but...

278
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,010
该你叫球了
...it's gotta be your call.

279
00:21:49,094 --> 00:21:50,082
好
Okay.

280
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:53,007
给我7号铁头球棒
Give me a 7 iron.

281
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,011
知道了
Got it.

282
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:01,029
抬起头来!
Heads up over there!

283
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,000
-没有机会的!  -不要打飞了!
-No chance!  -Don't blow it!

284
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:06,080
你打不到我们周围的!
You won't get anywhere near us!

285
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,075
医生!  你在这儿呀
Hey! Doc!There you are.

286
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:15,054
有人说你朝这边来了
Somebody said you went this way.

287
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:20,075
听着  我的皮疹开始扩散了  有釉子那么大了
Listen, that rash of mine is starting to spread. It's like the size of a grape...

288
00:22:21,092 --> 00:22:23,001
你们在干什么?
What are you guys doing?

289
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:25,097
打高尔夫?
Are you playing golf?

290
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:29,018
是的
Yeah.

291
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:32,052
我也能玩吗?
Can I play?

292
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:47,091
我为镇静剂的事道歉
Sorry about the sedative.

293
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:51,008
要移动你  这是我能想到的唯一的安全的办法
It was the only safe way for me to move you.

294
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:56,037
你提议要帮我修音乐盒
You offered to fix my music box.

295
00:22:57,021 --> 00:23:01,013
在我对你干了那么多事之后  打你  刺激你
After all I've done to you. Striking you, shocking you.

296
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:03,009
为什么?
Why?

297
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12,085
你想要我修你的音乐盒  还是不想?
Do you want me to fix your music box, or don't you?

298
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:18,027
是的  请
Yes, please.

299
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,032
那我想知道你的名字  你的名
Then I want to know your name. Your first name.

300
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:27,053
Danielle

301
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,011
我叫Danielle
My name is Danielle.

302
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:38,058
你是怎么来到这个岛上的 Danielle?
And how did you come to be on this island, Danielle?

303
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:53,010
我们是一支科考队的
We were part of a science team.

304
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:55,064
用枪武装的科考队

305
00:23:58,018 --> 00:24:01,010
-Robert也在队里吗?  -是的

306
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,023
还有Alex... 他也是?
And Alex, was he, too?

307
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:08,053
通讯设备坏了的时候  我们的船离开塔西提岛已经三天了
Our vessel was three days out of Tahiti when our instruments malfunctioned.

308
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,024
那是个晚上
It was night.

309
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,041
那暴雨...
The storm...

310
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,079
那咆哮...
The sounds...

311
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:21,067
船只被甩到了岩石上
The ship slammed into rocks,

312
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,034
冲到了地面  船体破裂到了无法修补的程度
ran aground,the hull breached beyond repair.

313
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:27,088
所以...
So...

314
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,072
我们扎了营
...we made camp.

315
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,030
找到了这个临时庇护所
Dug out this temporary shelter.

316
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:37,064
临时的
Temporary.

317
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:42,081
我们在这儿活了将近两个月

318
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,077
两个月  然后....
Two months before...

319
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:50,003
你的求救信号... 我接收到的...
Your distress signal. The message I heard.

320
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,045
你说  "它把他们都杀了"
You said "It killed them all."

321
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,025
我们从黑岩那儿回来
We were coming back from the black rock.

322
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,030
是他们
It was them.

323
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:17,051
-他们是携带者  -谁是携带者?
-They were the carriers.  -Who were the carriers?

324
00:25:18,076 --> 00:25:19,097
其他人
The others.

325
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,069
其他什么人?
What others?

326
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:25,086
"黑岩"是什么?
What is the black rock?

327
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:30,061
你在岛上看到其他人了?
Have you seen other people on this island?

328
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:31,049
没有
No.

329
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,070
但我听到了
But I hear them.

330
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:37,012
在丛林里面
Out there in the jungle.

331
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,016
他们低声细语
They whisper.

332
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,092
你认为我疯了
You think I'm insane.

333
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,077
我想你独处的太久了
I think you've been alone for too long.

334
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:21,045
我很抱歉  我只能找到这些了
I'm sorry. This is all I could find.

335
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,091
我会再找找  稍后给你带些水果
I'll try and bring you some fruit later on.

336
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:27,038
准备说了?
Are you ready to talk?

337
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,058
那取决于...
That depends on

338
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,067
...你想谈什么  Sayid
what you'd like to talk about, Sayid.

339
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:34,034
书?
Books?

340
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,018
天气?
Weather?

341
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,035
我被锁在这地牢  几周没见过书和天气了
Since I've seen neither locked in this cell for weeks,

342
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:42,006
恐怕我们的交谈会很不顺畅
I'm afraid my conversation will suffer.

343
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:44,027
有两个嫌疑犯在我们的监管下
We have two suspects in custody.

344
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:46,073
看这些照片
Have a look at these photographs.

345
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,098
你所要做的就是点头而已
All you need to do is nod.

346
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:51,065
如果你能证明自己愿意合作
If you prove you're willing to cooperate,

347
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,032
我想我能说服他们放了你的
I think I can get them to free you.

348
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:04,037
那样我就再也期待不到这样的"访问"了
Then I won't have these visits to look forward to anymore.

349
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:09,008
这不是个游戏  Nadia
This isn't a game, Nadia.

350
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:11,054
你却还在玩  Sayid
Yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

351
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:16,055
假装一些事(骗我)  我知道你不是
Pretending to be something I know you're not.

352
00:27:26,018 --> 00:27:27,056
你不会相信的
You'll never believe this.

353
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:29,085
你终于知道怎么系鞋带了?
You learned how to tie your shoes?

354
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:32,086
有趣  洞里有个家伙建了个高尔夫球场
Funny. Someone at the caves built a golf course.

355
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:35,003
-你很兴奋?  -真的  一个高尔夫球场
-Are you high?  -Seriously, a golf course.

356
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,094
显然  Jack他们现在在一块儿玩
Jack's playing right now.

357
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:41,012
-Jack?  打高尔夫?  -我听说是这样
-Jack? Is golfing?  -That's what I hear.

358
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:45,049
我不知道你们怎么想  但我要去看看
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna check this out.

359
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,024
等等我  笨蛋
Wait for me, bonehead.

360
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:56,046
医生打高尔夫
Doctor playing golf.

361
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:59,008
好小伙啊  我现在是什么都听说了
Whoo! Boy howdy, now I've heard everything.

362
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:01,067
还会发生什么  偷吃炸面圈?
What's next, cop eating a donut?

363
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:03,084
如果你要来  说就行了
If you want to come, you should say.

364
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:06,080
我不屑一顾  雀斑女 我不热衷于集体活动
Think I'll pass on that, Freckles. Not big on crowds.

365
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:10,076
让我们面对吧  我也对人群不敢兴趣
And let's face it, crowd's not too hot on me, either.

366
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,060
一个接一个被遗弃
One outcast to another,

367
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,064
我在想我们得多努力一点
I'd think about making more of an effort.

368
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,098
建议收到
Duly noted.

369
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:30,049

375
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:05,065
回去?
Go?

376
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:08,074
回到我跟你说过的人群中去
Back to the people I told you about.

377
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:13,016
你不能回去  你得呆在这儿
You can't. You have to stay.

378
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:15,083
-不安全  -不安全?  什么不安全?
-It's not safe.  -Not safe? What's not safe?

379
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:17,083
你需要我  你不能走
You need me. You can't leave.

380
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:26,030
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

381
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,088
如果我们幸运  是其中一只熊
If we're lucky, it's one of the bears.

382
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,097

383
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:41,031
或许是那东西

384

根本没什么怪物
There's no such thing as monsters.

386
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:57,068
你得把她处理掉
You have to execute her.

387
00:29:57,093 --> 00:29:58,072
什么?
What?

388
00:29:58,093 --> 00:30:01,014
那女子什么消息都没给我们
The Jazeem woman has given us nothing.

389
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:04,014
这会让其它人觉得我们不会逼供
This will send a message to others who will not talk.

390
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,064
再多给我些时间

已经给你一个多月了  Sayid

399
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:37,080
老兄  我想你打进了

403
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,023
我差点认不出你了
I almost didn't recognize you.

404
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:53,060
-你笑了  -我得向前看
-You're smiling.  -I have to watch that.

405
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:56,077
你怎么想出这点子的?
So, how'd you come up with this?

406
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,065
不是我  都是Hurley弄的
Wasn't me. It was all Hurley.

407
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:02,028
为了让每个人感到安全  我都快疯了
I've been going crazy to make everyone feel safe.

408

我一直没睡好过  因为我想让每个人感到安全
I haven't been sleeping 'cause I want everyone to feel safe.

409

他建了个高尔夫球场
He builds a golf course,

410
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,025
每个人都感觉很安全
And everyone feels safe.

411
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:11,008
垃圾!  重来
Aw, crap! Do-over.

412
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:13,062
这是加击  加击
It's a Mulligan.

413
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:16,021
这是一项绅士运动  你得明白这个词  "加击"
A gentleman's sport. You got to get the words right.

414
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,009

你想要... 让我  让我
You want to... Let me.

417
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,009
伙计  放开我!
Get away!

418
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:24,026
你把我一个人留在洞里
You left me alone at the caves.

419
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:26,005
什么?  我让你和Claire在一起
What?  I left you with Claire.

420
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:27,018
她在睡觉
She's sleeping.

421
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:29,068
儿子  我... 我很抱歉
Oh, man, I'm... I'm sorry.

422
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,073
我只是...  我也刚过来
I just... I just got caught up.

423
00:32:32,002 --> 00:32:35,019
真的很抱歉 Walt  我把事情弄得一团糟
I'm really sorry, Walt. I screwed up.

424
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:37,086
我补偿给你  想玩吗?
I'll make it up to you. Hey, you wanna play?

425
00:32:42,082 --> 00:32:44,091
不了  其他人也在等
Nah. There's other people waiting.

426
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,045
不  这你不用担忧  他们不会介意的  想挥一杆吗?
They won't mind. You want to take a swing?

427
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,029
Michael  该你了  过来吧
Michael, it's your shot. You're up.

428
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:52,054
好  酷  那我们以后再玩  好吗?
Okay, cool. Uh, so we'll play later, okay?

429
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:25,028
把枪放下  Danielle
Put the gun down, Danielle.

430
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:28,003
放地上
Put it down on the ground.

431
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,054
不要
Don't.

432
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:55,073
这儿由我带过去
I'll take it from here.

433
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,095
什么... 发生什么事了?
What... what's going on?

434
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,087
门外40米处
Forty meters outside this door,

435
00:34:12,003 --> 00:34:14,037
有辆供货车  马上就要开了
there's a supply truck that will be leaving.

436
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,096
他们不会检查这辆车的外出
They don't check them on the way out.

437
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:17,008
进来的时候才会检查
They don't check them on the way out.

438
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:20,067
躲到里面  不管用什么  一定要把自己遮盖起来
Cover yourself any way you can.

439
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:22,080
30分钟内  他们赶不到市里
They won't reach the city for 30 minutes.

440
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:25,013
你有足够的时间跳车  然后藏起来
That's enough time to hide.

441
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,026
和我一起去
Come with me.

442
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:28,088
我不能
I can't.

443
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:30,085
逃避
Desertion.

444
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,001
他们会杀了我全家的
They would kill my family.

445
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,098
我没有你那样的勇气
I don't have your courage.

446
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,060
你的勇气比你知道的要多
You have more than you know.

447
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,015
Nadia  你得走了
Nadia, you have to go.

448
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,015
Sayid?

449
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:53,070
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

450
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:00,021
不要
Don't.

451
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,021
警卫!
Guard!

452
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,018
Sayid!

453
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:11,080
现在你得和我一起走了!  他们会杀了你的!
Now you have to come with me! They'll kill you!

454
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:14,081
不  你逃走了  你偷了我的枪然后杀了他
No. You escaped, you stole my gun,and you shot him.

455
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:17,031
又打了我
And then you shot me.

456
00:35:22,048 --> 00:35:23,061
Sayid!

457
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:30,086
拿住
Take it.

458
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:33,016
求你了  Nadia
Please, Nadia.

459
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,020
拿住  走吧
Take it and go.

460
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:59,089
拜托了  我并不想伤害你
Please,I don't wish to hurt you.

461
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:02,002
已经伤害了
You already have.

462
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,031
不要
Don't.

463
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:15,078
撞针已经被拿掉了
The firing pin has been removed.

464
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:21,062
我打Robert的时候  他也不知道这已经没了
Robert didn't notice it was missing, either, when I shot him.

465
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:24,054
但你爱他
But you loved him.

466
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:27,046
-他病了  -病了?
-He was sick.  -Sick?

467
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:33,005
病夺去了他们的生命  一个接着一个
It took them... one after the other.

468
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:34,089
我无从选择
I had no choice.

469
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:37,076
他们都已经迷失了
They were already lost.

470
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,077
你杀了他们
You killed them.

471
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:44,069
如果我们被解救会发生什么事吗?
What would have happened if we were rescued?

472
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:47,015
我不允许那样的事情发生
I couldn't let that happen.

473
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:49,036
我不会!
I won't!

474
00:36:50,036 --> 00:36:51,061
我没病
I'm not sick.

475
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,082
我知道
I know.

476
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,024
那为什么要杀了我?
Then why kill me?

477
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
我不能放你走
I can't let you go.

478
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,078
你不明白吗?
Don't you understand?

479
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:13,049
可以和人说说话  可以触摸...
To have someone to talk to...to touch.

480
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:22,067
"今生找不到我  来世会找到我的"
"You'll find me in the next life,if not in this one."

481
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:25,025
什么?
What?

482
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:28,050
写在Nadia照片后面的话
The writing on the back of Nadia's photograph.

483
00:37:30,009 --> 00:37:33,001
我知道  等待一个人是什么感觉
I know what it's like to hold on to someone.

484
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:39,006
过去的7年  我一直在等待  为的就是一个希望
I've been holding on for seven years to just a thought.

485
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:44,019
一个渺茫的希望  希望在某个地方她还活着
A blind hope that somewhere she's still alive.

486
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,040
但是我越坚持
But the more I hold on,

487
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:53,053
我就越远离身边的人
the more I pull away from those around me.

488
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,095
离开这个岛的唯一的方法是...
The only way off this... this place,

489
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:03,050
是得到他们的帮助
is with their help.

490
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:25,014
和我一块儿去
Come with me.

491
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:31,003
没必要再孤独了  Danielle
You don't have to be alone, Danielle.

492
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,080
你们那些人
Your people,

493
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,051
你决意要回去的  那个地方的那些人
the ones you're determined to get back to.

494
00:38:57,097 --> 00:38:59,005
看着他们
Watch them.

495
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:03,006
看的仔细些
Watch them closely.

496
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:15,024
Danielle!

497
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,020
Alex是谁?
Who is Alex?

498
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,000
Alex是我的孩子
Alex was my child.

499
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:48,010
伙计们  拜托
Guys, please.

500
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,060
我以前还从没在场上打过杆
I've never made par on a course before.

501
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:57,077
-不!  -老兄  真是狗屎运啊
-Ah! No!  -Dude, you were robbed.

502
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,065
乱说!  看到了吧?
Bollocks! See that?

503
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:02,015
好  Jack  该你了
Okay, Jack, it's up to you.

504
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:04,049
要打进的话  你得件夹克
Sink this, you get the blazer.

505
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:07,028
-不要有压力  -是  不要有压力
-No pressure.  -Yeah, no pressure.

506
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:17,009
5美圆  我赌他打进
Five bucks says he sinks it.

507
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:20,059
小子  你赌他赢我?
You betting against me?

508
00:40:20,063 --> 00:40:22,076
抱歉  老兄  你和我一样是个蠢驴
Sorry, dude, But you're a duffer like me.

509
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:24,009
10美圆  我就压在你的赌注上
Make it ten.

510
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:26,089
我没现金  但我把晚饭压上  赌医生赢
I don't have any cash, but I'll bet my dinner on the doc.

511
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,064
我压两剂防晒油和一支手电筒  赌他输
I got two tubes of sunscreen and a flashlight says he chokes.

512
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:44,069
我赌他这边
I'll take that action.

513
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:50,037
是  是的  我也赌他
Yeah, me too.

514
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:52,016
你刚刚还赌Jack赢  傻蛋
You just bet on Jack, dumbass.

515
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:54,033
我们需要防晒油  公主
We need the sunscreen, princess.

516
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,073
你爸爸知道你来这了吗?
Does your father know you're here?

517
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,091
你能教我如何才能做到你那样吗?
Can you teach me how to do that?

518
