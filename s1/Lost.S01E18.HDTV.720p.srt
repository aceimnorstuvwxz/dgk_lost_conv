3
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:26,008
在这儿了 这就是我们的当务之急
Right now, this is our priority.

4
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:34,098
Danielle 你是怎么来这个岛的?
How did you come to be on this island, Danielle?

5
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,027
船撞在了岩石上 搁浅了
The ship slammed into rocks,ran aground.

6
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,054
等一下 伙计 你现在要什么?
Hold on a second, dude.You want what now?

7
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:03,040
你想做雪球?
You wanna make snowballs?

8
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:05,040
他要你抱紧那些竹子
Hold the bamboo tighter.

9
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,014
我认为是这样的
I think.

10
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,015
干得怎样了?
How's it coming?

11
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:12,031
不错
It's coming.

12
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,054
只要没有人搞破坏就行了 是吗?
Long as nobody sabotages this one as well, huh?

13
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:17,058
我让人24小时守着了
I got people standing guard 24/7.

14
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:20,019
任何企图想破环的或没这企图的人都进不来
Nobody gets near this,with or without intent to burn.

15
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:22,024
听着 我一直在想
I was thinking, uh,the chances of a passing ship

16
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:25,053
过往的船只看到这只救生艇的机会很小
spotting this raft out there is pretty slim.

17
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:27,050
我们能用点什么
We could use something to send a distress call

18
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,025
给可能在这附近的船只送去遇险信号
to any ship that might be close.

19
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:31,033
就像S.O.S.
Like an SOS.

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,000
好的 听着 我会去找Sayid的
OK. I'll ask Sayid,

21
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:34,068
但是就算他能做出一些那样的东西
but even if he could make something like that,

22
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:36,060
他也没有能源能使它运行
he's not gonna have anything to power it with.

23
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:39,069
Sayid没说过那个疯狂的法国女人有电池吗?
Didn't Sayid say that crazy French chick had batteries?

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,073
绝对没有
Absolutely not.

25
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,098
-我没有叫你去  -我会去的
-I'm not asking you to go.  -I'll do it.

26
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:48,001
伙计 我们只是...
We're trying...

27
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,043
你们真的以为她会放弃一些生存的必需品吗
Do you think she would give up something

28
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,062
而且是给一个完全的陌生人?
she needs to a stranger?

29
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,097
我所问的只是让你告诉我怎么找到她 只有这些
All I'm asking is for you to tell me how to find her. That's it.

30
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:56,091
我被带去她的营地时已经是人事不省了
I was brought unconscious to her camp.

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,052
当我逃出时 我更象是一只无头苍蝇  我不知道怎么找到她
I was disoriented. I don't know how to find her.

32
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:02,038
不知道 伙计 还是不想说?
Don't know, dude? Or don't want to?

33
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:06,065
Sayid 听着 你有她的地图和一些纸张
Sayid, look. You've got her maps and her papers.

34
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,092
并且你认为它们能代表什么
You thought they were pointing to something.

35
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,019
可能那些纸张和地图可以让我们找到她呢
Maybe they're pointing to her.

36
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:13,074
听着 我甚至不知这些纸张说明了什么
Look! I don't know what these papers mean!

37
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:16,036
我只知道 它们可能是她脑子不清时的胡言乱语
They could be the ravings of her disturbed mind.

38
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:18,060
夹杂着方程式的歌词
Song lyrics, mixed with equations!

39
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,060
如果这张地图能找到她
If this map is pointing to her,

40
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:28,063
那么你得知道她住在这里 在这块区域
then you should know she resides here in this area.

41
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:32,002
她给那地方取名为 Territoire Fonce
She gave it a name."Territoire Fonce. "

42
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:35,096
Shannon翻译后说它意思是黑暗的领土
Shannon translated it.It means "Dark Territory."

43
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,092
那听起来像是一个你想去的地方吗?
That sound like a place you'd like to visit?

44
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:40,015
这么说你不帮忙了?
So you won't help?

45
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,057
我没这么说
I didn't say that.

46
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:43,041
我会造一座代表我们遇险的灯塔
I'll build the distress beacon.

47
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,057
但是我建议你去找另外的能源
I suggest you find another power source.

48
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,056
驾驶员舱里肯定会有些什么
Something in the cockpit.

49
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,040
我们不去驾驶员舱
We're not going to the cockpit.

50
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,047
Hugo你在那儿做什么?
What are you doing in there?

51
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,040
没什么 妈妈 只是看点东西
Uno momento, mama.I'm just checking something out.

52
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,097
我希望你别再看那些不良节目了
I hope you're not watching those G-string mujeres again.

53
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:08,050
听着 妈 我们来谈谈这个
Look, Ma, we talked about this.

54
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,040
你想让我住在这儿 你就得尊重我的隐私
If you want me living here,you gotta respect my privacy.

55
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,040
况且 我没在看
And no, I'm not.

56
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,094
看看你
Look at you.

57
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:19,007
周六晚上
It's Saturday night.

58
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:23,014
一个成年人坐在家里看电视
A grown-up man sitting at home watching TV.

59
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:26,066
你应该出去 试着帮你自己找个好女人
You should go out.Try to find yourself a nice woman.

60
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:28,044
好的 我会去的
I'll get right on that.

61
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:31,064
至少试着吃得好一点 你又胖了
Try eating better.You're gaining weight again.

62
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:34,028
大的号码是 42
with the Mega Number 42.

63
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:40,054
那就产生了今晚百万彩票的大奖
And that makes tonight's Mega Lotto Jackpot Drawing

64
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:43,070
4 8 15

65
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:48,047
16 和 23 加上一个大号码42
16 and 23 with the Mega Number 42.

66
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,004
谁有了这个号码就是赢家
Whoever has those numbers has won

67
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,098
否则奖金就会累积到下次中奖
or will share in a near record jackpot.

68
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:58,003
是的 Mary Jo 因为已经16周没有人得奖了
That's right, Mary Jo,because this is the sixteenth week without a winner.

69
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:17,073
你醒了?
You awake?

70
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:20,074
我只是对自己感到惊讶
I was just wondering that myself.

71
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:25,080
那么 那个法国女士 她写了这些 对么?
That French lady wrote this stuff?

72
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:29,001
Hurley 半夜三更的 你想干什么?
It's the middle of the night.What do you want?

73
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:31,067
睡不着
Couldn't sleep.

74
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:33,046
我很好奇
And I got curious.

75
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:36,016
你和Shannon...
You and Shannon,

76
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:38,091
你们一直试着指出这些东西 并且
you guys have been trying to figure out some of this stuff,

77
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,003
我想知道... 你知道
and I was wondering what...

78
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,021
你们指出了...
you guys figured out

79
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,035
这些东西
about this stuff?

80
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:49,015
-哪些东西?  -我不知道
-What stuff?  -I don't know.

81
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,017
看看这些她花了点时间写下的数字
Well, take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times.

82
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,073
知道它说明什么么?
Got any idea what it means?

83
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:02,066
我认为在某时他们可能等价于什么
I thought at one time they might be coordinates of some kind.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,018
等价 是的
Coordinates, yeah.

85
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:07,077
你第一次找到她...
But when you first found her,

86
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,017
那法国女人...
the French chick,

87
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:12,017
你说你在沙滩上看见了一条金属线或是什么
you said you saw a wire or something on the beach.

88
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:14,096
然后你沿着它 找到了她
You followed it, and it led you to her.

89
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,012
不是 它引我走进了一个她设的陷阱
No. It led me into a trap she set.

90
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,089
但是她的地方也不远了 是么?
But her place is probably close, right?

91
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:23,057
为什么你突然对Rousseau这么感兴趣?
Why are you interested in Rousseau?

92
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,059
我没有
I'm not.

93
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:27,018
只是 你知道 谈谈话 伙计
Just making conversation, dude.

94
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,082
对不起 如果这不是时候
Sorry if it's a bad time.

95
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:31,068
晚安
Good night.

96
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:45,022
是的 是的 你
Yeah, you.

97
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:48,018
你是怎么想到大奖号码的? 有什么意义么?
How did you come up with the winning numbers?

98
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:52,081
它们只是  突然想到的
they just, sorta came to me.

99
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:54,081
说说你的家庭吧?
Why don't you introduce your family?

100
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:56,056
好的 
yeah, okay

101
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,031
这位...这位 害羞的美女是我妈妈Carmen 过来 妈
This bashful beauty is my mom, Carmen.Come here, Ma.

102
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:05,005
然后这是我的兄弟Diego和他的妻子Lisa
And this is my brother, Diego,and his wife, Lisa.

103
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:06,033
我们富有了!
We're rich!

104
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,072
好的 伙计 别理他 他是个傻蛋
Nice, dude.Ignore him.He's an idiot.

105
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,082
然后 
And,

106
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:12,004
你们得见见这家伙
You gotta meet this guy.

107
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,070
这是我认识的最伟大的家伙 我的爷爷Tito
This is the greatest guy I know.My grandpa, Tito.

108
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:19,078
他有三个工作...到现在多久了?
He's worked three jobs for... How long's it been, Abuelito?

109
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:22,030
-52年  -52年
-52 years.  -52 years.

110
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:23,077
他70岁了
He's 70 years old,

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,095
他最近的一次度假
and the closest thing that he's had to a vacation

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,061
是在4年前得了一个标兵的称号
is when they put a pacemaker in him four years ago.

113
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,058
所以我拿这些钱来做的第一件事
The first thing I'll do

114
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:33,062
就是给他他以后所赚的全部的钱
with the money is to give him the rest he's earned.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,055
因为对我来说十分重要的
That's what it's all about for me,

116
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,043
就是为我关心的人做些什么
to be able to do things for the people I care about.

117
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:42,029
因为最近我欠我的家庭很多
'Cause I really put my family through a lot recently,

118
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:45,079
所以  这样我就能弥补了
and, well, this way I can make it up to them.

119
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:48,019
你知道 可能给我妈妈买一幢新房子
You know, maybe even buy my mom a new house.

120
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:53,060
然后 在我爷爷航行回来时
And, Maybe after,my grandpa comes back from his cruise,

121
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:55,023
我们能 你们知道
we can get to do some of the things

122
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,008
做一些我们经常想要做的事
that we always wanted to do.

123
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:02,016
爷爷?
Grandpa?

124
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,008

只是觉得我可以去散散步 呃

134
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:34,067
可能找到一些 呃 新的垂钓地点

00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,008
不 我可以领略一下外面的新鲜空气
I could use a bit of the wide open.

138
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:40,096
伙计 我现在能一个人静静么
Dude, I could really use some alone time right now.

139
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:43,047
当然
Sure.

140
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,036
我人太大 很容易脱水
I'm a big guy.I get dehydrated easy.

141
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,051
是的
Yeah.

142
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,028
是的 好
Yeah, okay.

143
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,028
Claire

144
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,078
有空么?
you got a second?

145
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,062
是的 当然
sure.

146
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:16,040
我想你有空在工程上帮我一个忙么
I was wondering if you're free to help me with a little project.

147
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,085
-我?  -是的
-Me?  -Yeah.

148
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,096
我在造东西 我需要你的帮忙
I'm building something and I could use an extra pair of hands.

149
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:23,058
我怀孕快9个月了
I'm nine months pregnant.

150
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:25,039
我只能在沙滩上摇摇晃晃地走
I can barely waddle to the beach.

151
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,044
你能看一下么?
Could you hold a saw?

152
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:30,024
好的
yeah.

153
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,025
你的手能这样来来回回动么?
Can you move your hand back and forth?

154
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,017
可能吧
Possibly.

155
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:36,031
你真棒
You're perfect.

156
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,065
好的
Okay.

157
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:51,012
那么 我们在造什么?
So, what exactly are we building?

158
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:55,050
在哪儿?
Where is it?

159
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,014
什么在哪儿?
Where's what?

160
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,023
地图 我告诉过你它对你找到她没有作用
The map. It won't help you find her.

161
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:02,046
那张地图不在我这儿
I don't have it.

162
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,098
更坏的是这卑鄙勾当不是你自己干的
What's worse is you won't do your own dirty work.

163
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,099
-你让Hurley帮你做  -等等
-You get Hurley to do it.  -Wait a minute.

164
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,039
Hurley?

165
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,027
他昨晚在我的帐篷里向我盘问关于Rousseau的事情
He was in my tent last night.Quizzing me about Rousseau.

166
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,081
关于她写的数字
About numbers she wrote,

167
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:14,027
我怎么去找她
how I came to find her.

168
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,080
你什么都不知到 是不是?
You don't know anything about this, do you?

169
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:22,056
Charlie.

170
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,088
你看到Hurley了么?
have you seen Hurley?

171
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:27,092
几个小时前 他散步去了
Couple of hours ago.He was setting out for a walk.

172
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,070
像个笨蛋一样 我得说明
Acting like a loon, I might add.

173
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,043
天那 他去追踪她了
My God. He's going after her.

174
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,096
你什么时候回来?
When are you gonna be back?

175
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,024
我们能赶上他的话 天黑之前
If we catch him, before nightfall.

176
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:42,030
你担心我?
Are you worried about me?

177
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:44,085
如果我是呢?
So what if I am?

178
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,034
Sayid!

179
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:50,026
准备好了么?
You ready?

180
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:57,055
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

181
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:19,095
Hugo 把那噪音关掉
Hugo, turn that noise down.

182
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,071
抱歉
sorry.

183
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,047
带我去哪儿?
Where are you taking me?

184
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:28,041
你知道我不喜欢惊喜
You know I don't like surprises.

185
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,012
你会喜欢这样的 妈
You're gonna like this one, Ma.

186
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:32,035
我是说 当你经历了所有事情之后
I mean, after everything you've been through...

187
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,084
就像爷爷
like Grandpa

188
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,012
然后是葬礼
Then at the funeral,

189
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,078
神父Aguilar因为闪电而罢工
Father Aguilar getting struck by lightning.

190
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:45,025
那真荒谬
Man, that was a freak storm.

191
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:51,010
Diego在Lisa离开他跟着那个招待跑了之后搬会了家
And Diego moving back home after Lisa left him for that waitress.

192
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,087
别跟我提那个婊子
Don't mention that whore.

193
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:55,070
我只是说该是你享福的时候了
I'm just saying, you deserve something good to happen.

194
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,058
你知道...
You know,

195
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:05,019
从我中了彩票大奖之后 就像...
ever since I won the lottery, it's like...

196
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:08,088
我们除了坏运气还是坏运气
we've had nothing but bad luck.

197
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,024
就像... 我不知道
Like, I don't know,

198
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,017
钱的诅咒还是什么
the money's cursed or something.

199
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,072
胡说八道
That's blasphemy.

200
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:19,067
你知道我们是天主教徒 我们不相信诅咒
You know we are Catholic.We don't believe in curses.

201
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,097
妈 我只是说说
Jeez, Ma, I'm just talking.

202
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:27,006
好了 我们快到了 来 穿上这个
Okay, we're almost there.Here, put this on.

203
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,023
我为什么得穿这个?
Why do I have to wear this?

204
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,012
手 小心
Give me your hand. Careful.

205
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,043
不不 你...你小心
You be careful.

206
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,021
-下台阶  -我什么都看不见
-Stepping down.  -I can't see anything.

207
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,054
好的 现在拿下你的眼罩
Okay, now,take off your blindfold,

208
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,088
然后看看你的新的梦幻豪宅
and get a look at your new dream house.

209
00:11:56,096 --> 00:12:00,024
我的脚踝  我的脚踝 
My ankle.My ankle.

210
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,073
我说过你可以拿下你的眼罩了
I said take off your blindfold.

211
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,024
你起先为什么要我带上呢?
Why did you make me put that thing on?

212
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:10,034
Hugo 是有烟味么?
do I smell smoke?

213
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:12,045
混蛋
crap!

214
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:14,036
等下 妈 我打911
Hang on.ma. I gotta call 911.

215
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:16,024
好的 告诉他们我扭伤了我的脚踝
You tell them I broke my ankle.

216
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:27,056
放下电话 远离车子
Drop the phone.Move away from the vehicle.

217
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:29,074
不 不 不 是这房子 这是一个误会
No, no! It's the house.This is a mistake.

218
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,084
快 转过去
Do it! Now!Turn around.

219
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:37,088
没有诅咒这一说 是么 妈?
No such thing as curses, Ma?

220
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:40,036
你有权力保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

221
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,099
但是你所说的一切
Anything you say can and will

222
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:44,023
将成为呈堂证供
be used against you.

223
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,017
法国女人!
French chick!

224
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:10,092
我认为你会高兴的
I would think you'd be happy.

225
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:12,073
你的股票都涨了
Every one of your stocks is up.

226
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,054
你对这些厉害的暴风席卷佛罗里达后
Your interests in orange futures skyrocketed

227
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,099
留下的桔色的流星焰火感兴趣
after those tropical storms hit Florida.

228
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:24,047
并且你现在是Tustin一家制盒公司的股东
And you are now the majority shareholder for a box company in Tustin.

229
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,040
一家制盒公司?
A box company?

230
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,093
他们生产盒子
They make boxes.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,070
有利的事业 每个人都需要盒子
Lucrative business.Everybody needs boxes.

232
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,047
这让我想到了...
Which reminds me,

233
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:34,066
你在加拿大的运动鞋厂...
your sneaker factory in Canada...

234
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:36,026
我在加拿大有鞋厂?
I own a sneaker factory in Canada?

235
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:37,070
不再有了
Well, not anymore.

236
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:40,006
上月在一场火中毁了
It was destroyed in a fire last month.

237
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:42,006
当然是这样了
Of course it was.

238
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:46,026
你可以认为是胡说八道 死了八个人
You might have read about it.Eight-something people died.

239
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,079
但是好消息是我们给这件事做了过保
But the good news is,we over-insured it.

240
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,069
这将使你发一笔横财
It's gonna yield you a windfall.

241
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:54,038
我们把它添加到从LAPD得来的有关你被非法拘留
And when we add in the generous settlement from the LAPD

242
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:55,050
的解决方案
for your false arrest,

243
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:59,008
你的资本净值在几个月内就会是现在的两倍
you've almost doubled your net worth in a few short months.

244
00:13:59,016 --> 00:14:03,027
我还是无法想象警察怎么会把你当毒贩给逮捕起来的
I still can't imagine how the police mistook you for a drug dealer.

245
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,065
厄运
Bad luck.

246
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:07,067
Hugo 不只一个中彩票大奖的人
Hugo.You are not the first lottery winner to believe

247
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:10,008
会认为钱给他们带来的只是厄运
the money's brought nothing but trouble.

248
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,027
这些只是你脑子里想想的
It's all in your head.

249
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,092
什么 你不相信不详物这一说?
What, you don't believe in jinxes?

250
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,088
就像 诅咒?
You know, curses?

251
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:15,097
我是一个会计 我相信数字
I'm an accountant. I believe in numbers.

252
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,083
你从哪儿得到他们的?
where'd you get them, anyway?

253
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,057
什么?
What?

254
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:20,062
大奖号码 你用了...
The winning numbers. What'd you use...

255
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,039
某人的生日? 电话号码
Somebody's birthday? Phone number.

256
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,069
不是 这只是一些...
Nah, it's nothing. It's just something that I

257
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:33,055
-什么?  -就是了
-What?  -That's it.

258
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:36,061
这不是钱的问题 是号码的问题
It's not the money. It's the numbers.

259
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,025
这是被诅咒的号码
The numbers are cursed.

260
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:42,026
伙计 别这么看着我 我没疯 这真的是...
Dude, don't look at me like that. I'm not crazy. This is really

261
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:45,014
好了 Hugo 听你自己的 "钱是被诅咒的"
Come on, Hugo, listen to yourself. "The numbers are cursed."

262
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,073
你知道不会发生这些事 就像是...
You know there is no such thing as a

263
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,025
你要撞得更狠一些么?
You want to hit that a little harder?

264
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,053
抱歉
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:09,053
我在做救我们命的逃生艇打扰了你么?
Is my building a raft to get us rescued bothering you?

266
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,014
就现在来说 是的
At the moment, yeah.

267
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,034
你为什么不来帮忙?
Why aren't you helping?

268
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:16,027
我正在帮忙...防着纵火犯
I am helping, short round...keeping watch for arsonists.

269
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:18,028
Walt说对了
Walt's got a point.

270
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:20,032
你可以更努力点
You could pitch in,

271
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,036
好像你已经买了逃生票一样
seeing as how you've already bought your ticket.

272
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:28,073
你是照我说的那样绑得么?
Did you tie this like I told you?

273
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:31,094
因为如果你是像我说的那样绑好了的话  那些东西就不会散了
'Cause if you'd have tied it like I said, the thing would still be together!

274
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:36,033
你怎么了? 你在想什么?
What's the matter with you? What is your problem?

275
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:42,025
他不会再和我说话了
He's never going to speak to me again.

276
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:45,024
他需要的是时间
He just needs time.

277
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:49,017
我让他丢脸了
I humiliated him.

278
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:58,020
当救生艇起航时...
When the raft sails...

279
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:02,046
你认为他会和他们一起走么?
do you think he's going to leave with them?

280
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:05,056
我不知道
I don't know.

281
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,070
别动
Don't move!

282
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:51,052
-你们这些家伙...  -Hurley 别动
-what are you guys  -Hurley, do not move.

283
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:53,044
你正站在一个压力触发机上
You're standing on a pressure trigger.

284
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:57,006
如果你走开 那个就会发射出来
If you take your weight off it, it will release that.

285
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,051
天那
man.

286
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,028
我们得找一些东西替代他的体重
We need to find something to replace his weight on the trigger.

287
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,067
代替他的体重? 我们能做到么?
Replace his weight? How are we going to do that?

288
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:10,005
别动
Don't move!

289
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:12,045
大家冷静一下
Everybody, just calm down.

290
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:13,068
我能放下这根线么?
Can I drop the wire?

291
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,081
-也许我能找到块岩石  -是的 大一点的
-Maybe I can find a rock.  -Yes, a big one.

292
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,097
-我要把线放了  -Hurley 不
-I'm dropping the wire.  -Hurley, no!

293
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:21,064
我能做到
I can make it.

294
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,086
Hurley 别动
Hurley, don't move!

295
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:24,031
我能逃掉的 我很敏捷
I can get out of the way. I'm spry.

296
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,095
Hurley 原位别动
Hurley, stay put!

297
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,028
Hurley Hurley 别...
Hurley! Hurley! Don't even

298
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:35,099
Hurley 你到底是怎么了?
Hurley, what the bloody hell is wrong with you?!

299
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,038
没什么
Nothing.

300
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,095
你在这儿干什么 伙计?
What are you doing out here, man?

301
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,098
我来拿电池
I came to get a battery.

302
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:47,015
Hurley 认真点
Hurley, seriously.

303
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:48,084
怎么了?
What's going on?

304
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,023
你们也来么?
You guys coming?

305
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:58,032
你们都想去?
You all want to go?

306
00:17:58,096 --> 00:17:59,066
好的
Fine.

307
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:02,026
但是要我来打头
But perhaps I should take the lead.

308
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:04,045
好想法
Excellent notion.

309
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:14,089
Lenny 他叫Lenny 或是 Leonard.
Lenny. His name is Lenny. Or Leonard.

310
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:16,060
但是你不知他姓什么
But you don't know his last name.

311
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,088
听着 我只想和他说5分钟的话
Look, I just need to talk to him for five minutes.

312
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:21,070
抱歉 但是先生  如果你不能说出病人的名字
I'm sorry, but if you can't tell me the patient's name, sir,

313
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,003
我就不能查了
I can't very well look it up.

314
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,033
这儿有多少Leonards?
How many Leonards are here?

315
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:26,052
只是...你不能只是打入"Leonard"?
Just...can't you just type in "Leonard"?

316
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:29,060
我是说 这家伙就像永远呆在这儿了 他认识我
I mean, the guy's been here for, like, ever. He knows me.

317
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:32,018
我们的纪录是保密的 先生 任何人...
Our records are private, sir, and anybody...

318
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,024
伙计 现在别干那个
Dude, do not do that right now!

319
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:37,096
下次再来修 你这家伙
Leave the bulb for another time, man.

320
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,095
5分钟
Five minutes.

321
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,090
我只要5分钟
All I need is five minutes.

322
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:48,076
Hugo?

323
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,043
医生
doc.

324
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:54,042
见到你真好 你回来干什么?
It's good to see you. What are you doing back here?

325
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,000
我不记得你和Leonard这么亲密 Hugo.
I don't remember you and Leonard being that close, Hugo.

326
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:05,004
是的 我们来
Yeah, well, we hung.

327
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,012
我会留给你们的 要么
I'll leave you gentlemen to it, then.

328
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:09,053
好运 Hugo
Good luck, Hugo.

329
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,095
Lenny.

330
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:20,029
记得我么?
Remember me?

331
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:24,010
Hugo

332
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:27,057
Hurley

333
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,059
我...
Well, I was...

334
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:35,088
我只是 你知道 在附近 而且 
I was just, you know,in the neighborhood, and,

335
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:42,065
听着 Lenny 我要知道...
Look, Lenny, I got to know

336
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:44,093
那些号码代表着什么?
what do the numbers mean?

337
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:51,024
4 8 15 16 23 42  4 8 15 16 23 42...

338
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,089
它们对你有害么?
Did they do something to you?

339
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,077
因为我觉得他们对我有害
'Cause I think they did something to me.

340
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:01,003
我认为他们使我变成了一个倒霉蛋
I think they turned me into a jinx.

341
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:04,030
对我周围的人而言的扫把星
Bad news to everyone around me.

342
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:07,025
当我和大家说 我觉得我是起因时 他们...
And when I tell people, I think I'm the cause, they

343
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:11,005
他们..他们看着我就像在看白痴
they...they look at me like I'm nuts.

344
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:12,070
他们不相信我
They don't believe me.

345
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,021
但是我知道
But I know.

346
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:16,040
自从我用这些号码赢了彩票后
Ever since I won the lottery with those numbers.

347
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:26,054
你用这些号码去买彩票了?
You used those numbers to play the lottery?

348
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:32,014
是的
yeah.

349
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,071
你不该这么做的
You shouldn't have done that.

350
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,091
你把盒子打开了
You've opened the box!

351
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:39,030
你不应该用这些号码的
You shouldn't have used the numbers!

352
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:42,067
它还没停下 你得远离那些号码
It doesn't stop! You got to get away from those numbers!

353
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,088
你得离的远远的 越远越好
You got to get far, far away!

354
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:45,091
你听见我说的么
Do you hear me?!

355
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,021
你难道不知道
Don't you understand?!

356
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:49,074
你得远离它 否则它不会停下的
You got to get away from them or it won't stop!

357
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:51,062
等一下 等一下 我需要答案
Wait a sec, wait a sec. I need some answers.

358
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,092
先生 你得离远点
Sir, you need to step away.

359
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,030
Lenny 这些号码 你从哪儿来的?
Lenny, the numbers! Where'd you get them?

360
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,027
Sam Toomey 他听来的
Sam Toomey! He heard them!

361
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:57,014
谁是Sam Toomey?
Who's Sam Toomey?

362
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,039
他从Kalgoorlie听来的
He heard them in Kalgoorlie.

363
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,007
什么是Kalgoorlie?
What's Kalgoorlie?

364
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:00,083
那是一个我们曾经工作过的镇
It's a town where we used to work.

365
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:01,077
哪儿的镇?
A town where?

366
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:04,043
在澳大利亚
In Australia!

367
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,073
天那 
Oh, god!

368
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:11,091
在这儿没了了 伸入地下了
It stops here. It goes into the ground.

369
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,051
这有点困难
This poses somewhat of a problem.

370
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:17,051
伙计们
Guys,

371
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,018
你们来看看这个
you should come see this.

372
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:41,028
你从没提到过桥
You never mentioned anything about a bridge.

373
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:42,085
我从没看见过
I never saw this before.

374
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:46,036
她不可能凭一己之力造出这座桥的
There's no way she could have built this all by herself.

375
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:47,098
是的 但是她的队伍可以
No, but her team could have.

376
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,017
或是Ethan的队伍
Or Ethan's team.

377
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:53,060
Hurley 你在做什么?
Hurley, what are you doing?

378
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,029
放松点 我只是去看看
Relax. I'm just going to check it out.

379
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,058
你们得呆在这儿
You guys should stay here.

380
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,092
Hurley 快回来
Hurley, get back here!

381
00:21:58,003 --> 00:21:59,032
伙计 别扫兴
Dudes, chill.

382
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,060
Charlie

383
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,088
他都能过去...
if he can do it...

384
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,076
Charlie 快
Charlie! Move!

385
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:27,039
伙计 还好吧
Dude, you okay?

386
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,028
我很好
I'm okay!

387
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:34,045
好的 你们在那儿别动
All right, you two stay put right there.

388
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:35,066
我们再去找条路
We're going to find a way around,

389
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,006
然后我们去那儿找你们
and we'll meet you there.

390
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,029
那 反过来 你们呆那儿
Nah, screw that. You guys stay.

391
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,079
这儿有条小路 Charlie...
There's a path right here. Charlie...

392
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,097
Hurley 闭嘴听Jack的吧 他叫我们别动
Hurley, will you shut up and listen to Jack?! He said stay put!

393
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,098
你就像一个嗜血的疯子
You're acting like a bloody lunatic!

394
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,072
如果这不是一个荒野之地  我会说你迷路了
If this weren't the middle of nowhere, I'd say you were lost.

395
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,048
这是Sam Toomey的家么?
Is this Sam Toomey's house?

396
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:08,034
是的 我是他妻子
It is. I'm his wife.

397
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:09,092
他在么?
Well, is he around?

398
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:12,053
我想找他说些话
'Cause I'd kind of like to talk to him.

399
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:17,031
我也想和他说话 但是Sam已经死了4年了
I'd like that, too, but Sam's been dead for four years.

400
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:23,036
你的丈夫和我认识的一个人工作过...Leonard Simms
Your husband worked with a guy I know...Leonard Simms.

401
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:27,016
是的 他们同在美国海军服役
That's right. They served together in the U.S. Navy.

402
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,029
Leonard怎样了? 还在当兵?
How is Leonard? Still in the service?

403
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:32,061
他...
he's...

404
00:24:33,064 --> 00:24:34,082
退役了
retired.

405
00:24:37,012 --> 00:24:39,038
不管怎样... 他和我说了Sam...
Anyway... he told me about Sam...

406
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:42,036
听到了些什么
hearing something.

407
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,018
你在说号码是么
You're talking about the numbers.

408
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:49,016
是的 就是那些号码
Yes. The numbers. Exactly.

409
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:51,064
你知道一些什么么?
Do you know anything about them?

410
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:57,026
Sam和Leonard在一个潜听哨站岗
Sam and Leonard were stationed at a listening post

411
00:24:57,033 --> 00:25:00,038
监视横跨太平洋的电波

412
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:03,049
无聊的工作 Sam很讨厌
Boring job. Sam hated it.

413
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,064
没事可做 只是一夜又一夜地听着静电噪声
Nothing to do but listen to static night after night

414
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:11,071
直到16年前的一个晚上
till one night, back 16 years ago,

415
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:14,009
电波里有些东西
there's something in the static.

416
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,059
有一个声音
A voice cuts through

417
00:25:16,074 --> 00:25:22,034
有一个声音不断的重复那些号码  一遍又一遍
a voice repeating those numbers over and over again.

418
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:28,076
几天后 天晴了 我们在Kalgoorlie
Couple of days later, we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie,

419
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,043
有这么一个罐子
and some wally there's got this jar.

420
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,039
像小马一样大
Must have been big as a pony,

421
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,063
边上镶满了豆子
and it's filled to the rim with beans.

422
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:37,022
小姑娘给任何一个在10次内可以猜对罐子里豆子数的人
Filly's offering 50 grand to anyone able to guess

423
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:40,042
罐子里豆子数的人
how many beans are in that jar

424
00:25:40,057 --> 00:25:41,092
5万美元
within 10.

425
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:44,046
Sam用了那些数字
Sam used the numbers.

426
00:25:44,057 --> 00:25:45,024
是的
Yep.

427
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,081
答案和豆子数刚好吻合
The answer was exact to the bean.

428
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:52,096
人们已经做这个游戏40年了
Man had been running the same scam for 40 years.

429
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:55,013
没有人说过接近的数字
Nobody'd ever come close.

430
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:57,080
所以我们赢了钱了
So we won the money.

431
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:59,047
回家路上
On the way home,

432
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,058
一辆卡车在高速公路上撞到了一棵树
a pickup truck blows a tire on the highway,

433
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:04,016
迎面撞伤了我们
hits us head-on.

434
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:07,051
那夜我失去了一只脚
Lost my leg that night.

435
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,012
Sam怎样?
What about Sam?

436
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:12,061
仅仅擦破了点皮
Barely a scratch.

437
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:16,072
大部分人会认为他很幸运
Most people would consider themselves lucky,

438
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:18,030
但是他没有
but not him.

439
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:22,042
从那以后他变了
He was never the same after that.

440
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,033
他开始写纪录
He started keeping a record.

441
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:29,015
纪录一切周围的人
He started keeping a record.

442
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:30,086
发生的可怕的事...
Anything terrible that happened to anyone around us

443
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:34,003
他认为这全怪他用了那些数字
he believed it was all because he used those numbers.

444
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:38,007
他把我们搬到了这个荒野之地  希望能停止厄运
He moved us out here in the middle of nowhere, hoping it would stop.

445
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,019
成功了么?
Did it?

446
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:42,068
他找到能让厄运停止的办法了么?
Did he ever find a way to make it stop?

447
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:50,038
他拿着一把短枪放入他的嘴里扣动了扳机
He put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.

448
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:56,060
你怎么了 Reyes先生?
What is it you're looking for, mr. Reyes?

449
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:03,017
我用它们...
I used them

450
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,015
那些数字
the numbers

451
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,074
赢了彩票
to win the lottery.

452
00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:16,020
现在我认为我受到了相同的诅咒
And now I think I'm under the same curse.

453
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:17,012
诅咒?
Curse?

454
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,044
没有什么诅咒
There's no curse.

455
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:20,043
但你刚刚和我说...
But you just told me

456
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,016
你认为我的脚还在
You think I'd still have my leg

457
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:24,058
如果Sam没有说对豆子的确切数目的话?
if Sam hadn't have picked the right number of beans?

458
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:26,045
你认为那个洪水就不会爆发了?
You think that floods wouldn't have happened,

459
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:28,018
那个...那个房子就不会被烧毁
that...that homes wouldn't have burned down,

460
00:27:28,024 --> 00:27:29,091
那些人就不会死?
that people wouldn't have died?

461
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:35,000
是的
Well, yeah.

462
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:38,097
你的命运如此 Reyes先生
You make your own luck, mr. Reyes.

463
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,058
别怪到这些混蛋的号码身上
Don't blame it on the damn numbers.

464
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:46,056
你只是在找一个并不存在的借口
You're looking for an excuse that doesn't exist.

465
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:52,040
这是个陷阱 是么?
It's a trap, right?

466
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:56,012
为了抓动物?
For catching animals?

467
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:58,065
拜托给我那个杯子?
Pass me that cup, please?

468
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:02,070
这黏黏的是什么?
what's this gunk?

469
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,051
胶水
Glue.

470
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,012
你在哪儿找到胶水的?
Where'd you find glue?

471
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,025
我从动物的脂肪里提炼出来的
I made it out of rendered animal fat.

472
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,047
你会做胶水?
You made glue?

473
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:19,028
你应该开一个秀场
You should have one of those shows where you,

474
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,077
就在你为人们造房子的地方
fix up houses for people.

475
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,034
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

476
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:30,050
谢谢
Thanks.

477
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:34,073
为了你...给了我一些做的事情
For this --giving me something to do.

478
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,024
我 我已经厌倦了想着在那儿发生的我的那些事
I'm , tired of trying to remember what happened to me out there.

479
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,097
那些是怎么来的?
How's that coming?

480
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:48,072
你的回忆?
Your memory?

481
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,067
这儿的那儿的一些零零碎碎地小事
Bits and pieces here and there.

482
00:28:52,094 --> 00:28:55,026
没什么是真正有意义的
Nothing that makes any real sense.

483
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:58,033
也许我能帮忙
Well, maybe I can help.

484
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:04,004
我对于将零碎的小东西凑起来很在行
I'm good at putting bits and pieces together.

485
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:28,058
怎么了?
What?

486
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:31,024
这儿很眼熟 这块地方
This is familiar...this area.

487
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,075
我们接近了
We're close.

488
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:36,051
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

489
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:39,015
我认为她住在地下
I thought she lived underground.

490
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:42,033
Jack

491
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,023
那该死的是什么?
What the hell was that?

492
00:29:56,031 --> 00:29:57,084
该死的防卫系统
Hell of a security system.

493
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:00,066
某人绊到了线 这些地方全炸开了
Somebody trips a wire, and the whole place blows up.

494
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:02,033
这儿没东西
There's nothing here.

495
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,099
-电池?  -没什么
-The batteries?  -Nothing.

496
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,039
我不懂
I don't get it.

497
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,035
她知道了
She knew.

498
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:17,016
她知道某天我会回来并且带着别人
She knew that one day I'd come back and bring others.

499
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,087
所以她放弃了这个地方
So she abandoned this place,

500
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,094
在这儿设了陷阱
booby-trapped it,

501
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:23,085
然后搬走了
and moved on.

502
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,015
搬去哪儿?
Moved on where?

503
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:28,013
Jack

504
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,061
Sayid

505
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:32,063
我们知道我们是去那儿么?
Do we even know where we're going?

506
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:35,096
爆炸的冲击波好像是从这边来的  我认为是
The blast sounded like it came from this way, I think.

507
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:37,041
但是你不知道
But you don't know.

508
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:39,008
伙计 你想从我这儿得到什么
Dude, what do you want from me?

509
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,055
我想要什么?
What do I want?

510
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:43,021
我想知道我们来这种荒野之地做什么
I wanna know what we're doing in the middle of nowhere.

511
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:45,054
别和我说是为了那些该死的电池
And don't tell me it's because of some stinking batteries.

512
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:48,026
一会儿你是个快乐开心好运的Hurley
One minute you're happy-go-luckygood-time Hurley

513
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:50,012
一会儿你又成了血腥讨厌呆板的Kurtz
and the next you're colonel bloody Kurtz.

514
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:52,071
这毫无道理 这不是你
It just doesn't make any sense. It's not you.

515
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,029
伙计 你不了解我
Dude, you don't know me.

516
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,027
在岛上的这么多时候  你从没和我说起过你自己
Well, all this time on the island, you've told me nothing about yourself.

517
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:58,068
我们都有隐私 伙计
We all got personal stuff, dude.

518
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:59,092
别转移话题
Don't change the subject.

519
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:01,048
我们在这儿迷路了
We're lost out here.

520
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,089
Jack和Sayid如果没被炸成碎片的话那肯定是受伤了
Jack and Sayid could be hurt, if not blown to bits,

521
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:06,012
全都怪你扮得像个血腥的疯子
all because you're acting like some bloody nutter.

522
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:11,009
我没疯
I am not crazy.

523
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:16,006
-我是有原因的 为了...  -我认为我有权利知道
-I've got my reasons for...  -I think I have a right to know.

524
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:23,068
好的 你想知道是么?
Okay. All right, you wanna know?

525
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,005
大约一年前...
About a year ago...

526
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:34,095
有人在向我们开枪?
Is someone shooting at us?

527
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:01,018
你肯定是法国女人
You must be the french chick.

528
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:03,008
-你是谁?  -Hurley
-Who are you?  -Hurley.

529
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:04,090
我
I

530
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:12,058
Sayid 那个你拷打过的人...他
Sayid...that guy you tortured...he

531
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,074
你那时在飞机上
You were on the plane.

532
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:19,048
听着 我来这是为了找...放松 别紧张 别紧张
Look, I came here to find...easy, easy. Easy.

533
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:23,093
我...我只是拿了你的笔记
I'm...I'm just getting your notes.

534
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:32,026
请...
Please...

535
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,090
你告诉我为什么你写下这些
tell me why you wrote this.

536
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:37,000
请告诉我这些数字代表了什么?
What do these numbers mean, please?

537
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,033
我不知道
I don't know.

538
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,001
什么?
What?

539
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,064
你不知道?
You don't know?

540
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:50,069
好的
Okay,

541
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:52,059
那个在丛林里的东西
that thing in the woods,

542
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:57,000
也许是只妖怪
maybe it's a monster,

543
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:02,027
也许是一只该死的长颈鹿 我不知道
maybe it's a pissed-off giraffe, I don't know.

544
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:07,075
那个没人在找我们的事实..
The fact that no one is even looking for us

545
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:09,082
是的 那很诡异
yeah, that's weird.

546
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,040
但是我只是去附和它
But I just go along with it

547
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:14,024
因为我赶了一程过来..
'cause I'm along for the ride...

548
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:16,066
只是为了好玩 老顽童Hurley
good old fun-time Hurley.

549
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:19,041
你想什么..
Well, guess what...

550
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:24,013
现在 我要一些怪异的回答
now, I want some freakin' answers!

551
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,046
我们的船截获了一串电波...
Our ship picked up a transmission...

552
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,060
一个重复着这些数字的声音
a voice repeating those numbers.

553
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,084
我们改变了计划去研究它
We changed course to investigate.

554
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,039
在我们的船只失事后
After we shipwrecked,

555
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:55,049
我的队伍继续搜寻着电波的来源
my team continued to search for the transmission source.

556
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:59,028
几周后在我们找到了电波发射塔
It was weeks before we found the radio tower.

557
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:01,013
岛上有电波发射塔?
There's a radio tower on this island?

558
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:04,029
在黑岩石上
Up by the black rock.

559
00:34:06,072 --> 00:34:08,024
我们中的一些人继续着
Some of us continued

560
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:11,033
在等待救援的同时
to search for the meaning of those numbers

561
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:13,061
探索着这些号码的意义
while we waited for rescue.

562
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:16,061
但是那时 病魔袭来了
But then the sickness came.

563
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,033
当我的队伍都死了
When my team was gone,

564
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:26,098
我回到了那座塔 改变了电波
I went back up to the tower and changed the transmission.

565
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:29,069
就是我们听到的求救信号?
That distress signal we heard.

566
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,060
是的
Yes.

567
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:32,029
但是这些数字...
But the numbers...

568
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:38,030
你找到了有关它们的什么了么?
did you ever find out anything about them?

569
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,052
你知道它们怎么会有灵力的么?
Do you know where they got their power?

570
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,077
灵力?
Power?

571
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:47,050
它们给你周围的人带来厄运
They bring bad stuff to everyone around you.

572
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:49,074
它们是被诅咒的
They're cursed.

573
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:51,019
你是知道的 对么?
You know that, right?

574
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,044
这些号码...
The numbers...

575
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,092
它们被诅咒了
they're cursed.

576
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:59,004
我就是被这些号码带来这里的
The numbers are what brought me here.

577
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:01,074
在它出现之后
As it appears,

578
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:04,024
它们又带来了你
they brought you.

579
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,039
那之后
Since that time,

580
00:35:09,014 --> 00:35:10,066
我失去了一切...
I've lost everything

581
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,045
每个我所关心的人
everyone I cared about.

582
00:35:16,003 --> 00:35:17,016
那么 是的
So, yes,

583
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,086
我认为你是对的
I suppose you're right.

584
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,028
它们是被诅咒了的
They are cursed.

585
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,062
谢谢
Thank you.

586
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:34,075
谢谢
Thank you.

587
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:40,093
你不会知道我为了有人赞同我
You have no idea how long I've been waiting

588
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:42,081
而等了多久
for someone to agree with me.

589
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:46,043
谢谢
Thank you.

590
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,022
上帝 谢谢你
god, thank you.

591
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:50,033
真的太谢谢你了
Thank you so much.

592
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,074
我们得找到Hurley和Charlie
We need to find Hurley and Charlie

593
00:35:58,045 --> 00:35:59,073
然后走出这片丛林
and get out of this jungle.

594
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:04,012
我只是不想两手空空得回去
I just hate that we're going home empty-handed.

595
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:12,074
有人朝我们开枪...
someone shot at us...

596
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,047
Hurley和我
Hurley and me.

597
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:14,076
我们正在找你 然后...
We were looking for you, and...

598
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:17,040
-Hurley在哪儿?  -我不知道
-Where's Hurley?  -I don't know.

599
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:19,013
他本来就在我后面  然后他就...
He was right behind me, then he just...

600
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:20,076
他就不在了
he just wasn't.

601
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:26,043
-我去找他  -不 不 不 我们一起去
-I'll go and find him.  -No, no, no, we'll all go.

602
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:27,055
去哪儿?
Go where?

603
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:32,066
Hurley 该死的发生了什么事?
Hurley, what the hell happened to you?

604
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:37,036
要电池么?
Need a battery?

605
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:42,045
她说嘿
She says hey.

606
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:17,042
你想过名字了么?
You think of a name yet?

607
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:20,049
小孩的名字
For the baby.

608
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:24,003
我还没有好好想过
I haven't really thought about it.

609
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,016
我想放弃它
I was gonna give it away.

610
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,050
你知道 带给别人领养
You know, for adoption.

611
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,094
那肯定是一个艰苦的决定
That must have been a difficult decision.

612
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,057
现在没事了
Well, doesn't matter now.

613
00:37:49,012 --> 00:37:50,068
今天是我的生日
It's my birthday today.

614
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:54,091
你为什么不跟任何人说?
Well, why haven't you told anyone?

615
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:57,048
我是一个怀孕的单身女人
I'm pregnant, single,

616
00:37:58,023 --> 00:38:01,051
并且在一个荒野的岛上
and on an island in the middle of nowhere.

617
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:04,074
是不是我的生日真的是不重要 是么?
It doesn't really matter that it's my birthday, does it?

618
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,077
我想是的
I guess not.

619
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:11,066
至少你们的生日离得很近...
At least your birthdays will be close togethe...

620
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:13,022
你和你的孩子...那真是好运气
you and your baby --and that's good luck.

621
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:15,035
是么? 你这么认为?
Yeah? You think?

622
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,042
是的
Yeah, I do.

623
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:19,005
你相信...
You believe in that...

624
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,034
运气?
luck?

625
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:24,081
我相信很多事情
I believe in a lot of things.

626
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,038
做好了
That should do it.

627
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:33,066
好了 我放弃
Okay, I give up.

628
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,089
那是什么?
What is it?

629
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,068
一只摇篮
It's a cradle.

630
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:53,095
生日快乐 Claire
Happy birthday, Claire.

631
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:58,067
谢谢
Thank you.

632
00:39:09,086 --> 00:39:13,024
我知道食物紧缺 但是你的衬衫?
I know food's scarce, but your shirt?

633
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:16,031
当你找到一个自助洗衣店 告诉我
When you find a laundromat, let me know.

634
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:28,022
回到丛林的时候
Back in the jungle,

635
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,015
在我们成为练习射击的靶子之前
before we became target practice,

636
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:32,047
你正要告诉我
you were gonna tell me

637
00:39:32,094 --> 00:39:36,011
是什么驱使你去寻求的
what inspired this little quest.

638
00:39:50,072 --> 00:39:53,045
我认为飞机失事可能是我的错
I think the plane crash might have been my fault.

639
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:55,012
别蠢了 你怎么可能...
Don't be daft. How could you possibly...

640
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,063
我们来这儿之前
before we came here,

641
00:39:56,072 --> 00:39:59,051
很多坏事都发生了  而每次我都正好在周围
a lot of bad stuff used to happen whenever I was around.

642
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:02,019
你想说什么 像是厄运?
What do you mean, like bad luck?

643
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,051
是的 那是...
Yeah, that's...

644
00:40:04,014 --> 00:40:07,060
那是一个描述那一切的恰当的词
that'd be kind of a mellow way of describing it.

645
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:11,027
坏事发生了
bad things happen.

646
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,020
飞机坠毁了 人死了
Planes crash, people die.

647
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:15,071
伙计 你真的应该让我先说完
Dude, you really oughta let me finish.

648
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,057
你认为你是唯一带行李的人么?
You think you're the only person with baggage?

649
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,034
你知道飞机往下掉的时候我在做什么么?
You know what I was doing when the plane went down?

650
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:25,026
我在吸海洛因
I was snorting heroin

651
00:40:25,064 --> 00:40:26,058
在厕所
in the toilet.

652
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,053
我是一个有很大毒瘾的人
I was such a junkie,

653
00:40:30,038 --> 00:40:32,081
甚至在坐飞机的时候都得去吸食
I couldn't even take a plane ride without having a fix.

654
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:35,079
我认为那也是你的错
I suppose that was your fault as well.

655
00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:45,048
那么这怎么说?
So how 'bout it?

656
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:52,044
我刚刚告诉你了我这生最大的秘密
I just told you the biggest secret in my life.

657
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,045
我认为你应该说出你的来报答
I thought you'd wanna reciprocate

658
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:10,018
在家的时候...
Back home...

659
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:16,052
我有财产1亿5千6百万美元
I'm worth $156 million.

660
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:28,013
好了 别和我说了
Fine, don't tell me.

661
00:41:28,063 --> 00:41:29,044
伙计
Dude.

662
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:32,078
我把灵魂都赤裸裸呈现出来了 然后我得到的是无聊的笑话
I bare my soul, and all I get is bloody jokes.

663
00:42:03,045 --> 00:42:20,045
