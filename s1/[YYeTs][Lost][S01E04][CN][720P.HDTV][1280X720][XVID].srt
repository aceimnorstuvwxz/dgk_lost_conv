3
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,085
Walt 让狗安静点
Walt, you gotta keep that dog quiet.

4
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:57,018
我也不知道它怎么回事
I don't know what's wrong with him.

5
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:58,093
拜托 Vincent 不要再叫了
Come on, Vincent. Cut that out!

6
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:04,055
抱歉  抱歉
Hey. Sorry. Sorry.

7
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:32,080
什么东西?
What is it?

8
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:34,063
有人在里面
Somebody's in there.

9
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,077
里面的人都已经死了
Everyone in there's dead.

10
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:37,024
应该是Sawyer
Sawyer.

11
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:39,062
我在你后面 蠢驴
Right behind you, jackass.

12
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:46,027
Jack

13
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,020
我用手电筒照照看
I'm gonna shed some light on this thing.

14
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:36,091
快逃!
Run! Get out of here!

15
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:41,045
天哪! 怎么办?
crud. Now what?

16
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,010
快!
Come on.

17
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,046
它们走了
They've gone.

18
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:08,049
什么鬼东西?
What the bloody hell was that?

19
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,070
 双字幕： Sealovemoon  marjorie 七色九天

20
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,062
那些野猪是来寻找食物
Those boars were looking to feed.

21
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:32,080
我们得尽快把尸体处理掉
We have to get rid of the bodies.

22
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,083
埋了?   有一大堆死人呢
Bury them? There's a whole bunch in there.

23
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,099
超过20个
More than 20.

24
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:39,036
没有铲子很难挖
Digging will be difficult without shovels.

25
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,018
不能埋
Not bury.

26
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,079
我们得把他们烧了
We need to burn them.

27
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:45,013
他们是"人"
They're people.

28
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,084
我知道他们是人  Kate
I know they're people, Kate.

29
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:49,002
烧掉他们?!
Burning the remains.

30
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:50,067
任何方法都比"烧掉他们"要好
They deserve better than that

31
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:53,031
好什么好  被野兽吃掉就好了?
Better than what? Being eaten by wild animals?

32
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,070
就是因为要发生这样的事
That's what's gonna happen.

33
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:57,086
我们埋藏的尸体还是会被野兽挖出来吃掉的
Any bodies we bury are not gonna stay buried for long.

34
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,043
我知道这么做很难 但那个太阳底下的半机身...
Look, I know this seems harsh,but that fuselage in the sun...

35
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,091
这不是他们"应该得到"或"不应该得到"的问题
It's not about what they deserve.

36
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:09,039
他们已经死了  可我们没有
They're gone, and... we're not.

37
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,097
你说的可能有些道理
What you say may be true,

38
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:15,044
但是若要我们决定以何种方式让他们安息
but for us to decide how these people are laid to rest

39
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:16,042
我们没这个权力
it's not right.

40
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:18,098
无视他们的遗愿?
No regard for their wishes?

41
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:20,049
他们的宗教?
Their religions?

42
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,064
我们没有时间把每个人的宗教信仰搞清楚
We don't have time to sort out everybody's god.

43
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:25,024
真的吗?  我记得有一句话说我们无疑是由时间组成的
Last I heard, we were positively made of time.

44
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,084
我也很不乐意这么做
I'm not happy about it.

45
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,045
但我们是在偏离航道1000英里的地方坠毁了
We crashed a thousand miles off course.

46
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,012
救援队在另外一个地方找我们
They're looking in the wrong place.

47
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,041
已经过了4天了
It's been four days.

48
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:34,016
一个人都没来
No one's come.

49
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,054
明天清晨  我要你们每个人开始收集木头
Tomorrow morning we need everyone to start gathering up wood

50
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,046
干草
dried brush.

51
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,045
我们得把那机身烧成一个熔炉
We'll turn that fuselage into a furnace.

52
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:46,034
等到明天太阳下山以后  我们再点火
Wait until the sun goes down tomorrow night before we set the fire.

53
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,071
如果他这么急着想要焚尸体为什么我们要等到太阳下山?
If he's so eager to burn the bodies, why are we waiting till sundown?

54
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:56,031
他希望有人会看到这样的求救信号
He's hoping someone will see it.

55
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:16,009
看起来昨晚并不只我一个没睡好
Looks like I'm not the only one who didn't sleep last night.

56
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,086
比起收集柴火 我有更好的事情要做
There are better things to do with my time than collect firewood.

57
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:20,092
你不同意Jack的做法
You don't agree with Jack.

58
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:27,036
你在做什么?
What are you making?

59
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,001
暂时还说不清楚
Too soon to talk about.

60
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,042
我甚至不知道它会不会工作
I'm not sure if it will even work.

61
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:34,078
你还在试着接收信号  是吧?
Trying to pick up the transmission?

62
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,033
那个我们在接收机里听到的求救信号
The one we heard on the transceiver

63
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:40,038
如果那个法国女人的求救信号真的被循环播放16年了
If the French woman's transmissions have been playing on a loop for 16 years

64
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,081
那这个岛上一定有电力来源
there must be a power source on the island.

65
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,024
这是很重要的一个线索
A significant one.

66
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,032
你能找到它吗?
And you can find it?

67
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,024
理论上来说  是的
Hypothetically, yes.

68
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,001
我在做一种天线
I'm making an antenna of sorts.

69
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:53,098
然后把天线安置在岛上的不同位置
With a few of these mounted at different points on the island

70
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:57,006
或许我可以用接收机来三角定位这个信号
I may be able to triangulate the signal

71
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:59,008
试着找出这信号是哪儿来的
Find out where it's coming from

72
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,038
那么我能帮上什么忙吗?
So, what can I do to help?

73
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:06,056
看来你和我一样急着要离开这个岛
It appears you're as anxious to get off this island as I am.

74
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:11,063
接球 Vincent
Catch the ball, Vincent.

75
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,094
好家伙
Good boy.

76
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:15,084
接得漂亮  Vincent
Good job, Vincent.

77
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,063
你去哪  小子?
where you going, man?

78
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,014
哪儿都不去
Nowhere.

79
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,032
我只想看看Locke先生在干什么
I just thought I'd see what Mr. Locke was doing.

80
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:35,031
要不你和爸爸一块儿找柴火去?
why don't you help your dad with the wood?

81
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,034
我敢肯定 Locke先生一定不喜欢一个小孩成天在他周围晃来晃去
I'm sure Mr. Locke doesn't want a kid hanging around him all day.

82
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,048
至少他会和我说话
At least he talks to me.

83
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,071
走  Vincent
Come on, Vincent.

84
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:44,073
你这人怎么回事?
What's your problem?

85
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:46,024
-把它们给我!  -要是不呢?
-Hand 'em over!  -How about no?

86
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,092
这儿这么多人  你还想撒野?
There's other people here, or don't you give a crap?

87
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,060
是谁吃的比这每个人的平均分额还多!
If one of us wouldn't eat more than his fair share!

88
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,070
-你这么做太霸道了  -伙计们 好停手了
-That's bull!  -Knock it off.

89
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:54,024
你是不是占着便宜才会开心...
You're not happy unless you're screwing...

90
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,047
我惹人喜欢  肉球!
Hey, I'm peachy, pork pie!

91
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:57,035
-伙计 停手了!  -滚开  "地铁"!
-Knock it off!  -Stay out of this,metro!

92
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,084
你俩怎么回事?
What's going on?

93
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,071
Jethro在这儿藏最后一包花生豆
Jethro's hoarding the peanuts.

94
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:05,081
这是我的  我在那儿找到的
My own stash. I found it in there.

95
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,078
还剩多少食物?
What about the rest of the food?

96
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:11,027
根本没食物了  伙计
There is no rest of the food, dude.

97
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:14,028
都.....已经吃光了
We kinda... ate it all.

98
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,036
什么?
What?

99
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,079
好了  请大家冷静
Okay, everybody, just calm down.

100
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,082
我们会找到食物的
We can find food.

101
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:27,077
这岛上有充足的东西来供我们维持生命
There are plenty of things we can use for sustenance.

102
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:30,094
那么我们该"怎么"找这些用来维持生命的食物?
And exactly how are we gonna find this sustenance?

103
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:36,011
打猎
We hunt.

104
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,072
你怎么在飞机上找到这刀的?
How'd you get that knife on the plane?

105
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,027
我托运的
Checked it.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,059
可以说你投的好  也可以说...
You either have very good aim,or

107
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,034
投得不好  Mr...
very bad aim, Mr...

108
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,051
Locke

109
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:51,058
他的名字是Locke
His name is Locke.

110
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:54,033
好的  Locke先生  那么我们该打什么猎?
Mr. Locke, what is it that we're hunting?

111
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:58,015
我们都知道这岛上有野猪
We know there are wild boar on the island.

112
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:00,020
看它们的长相是尖背野猪
Razorbacks, by the look of them.

113
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:03,006
昨晚闯进营地的那些是小猪
The ones that came into the camp were piglets.

114
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:05,068
每只重100至150磅
A hundred, 150 pounds each.

115
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,008
那就意味着附近一定有只母猪
Which means that there's a mother nearby.

116
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:13,079
重250磅  拱着背  还有獠牙  性情暴戾
A 250-pound rat with scimitar-like tusks and a surly disposition

117
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:16,078
就喜欢吃周围动物的内脏
who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything near.

118
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:20,042
野猪的常用攻击方式是围着你打转  然后从后面突袭你
A boar's mode of attack is to circle and charge from behind

119
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:23,009
所以我想 要制服一头野猪  我们至少要3个人
so it will take three to distract her

120
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:26,093
我从侧面攻击小猪  用刀击中然后割破喉咙
long enough for me to flank a piglet,pin it and slit its throat.

121
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:29,075
你还把刀还他?
And you gave him his knife back?

122
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,015
是的  除非你能想出更好的点子...
Well, if you've got a better idea...

123
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,018
总比你们3个闯入魔鬼森林要好
Better than three of you wandering into the forest

124
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:37,079
就用一把小刀制服一只大猪?
to bag a hunk o' ham with nothing but a little bitty hunting knife?

125
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,048
明摆着不可能  这是我听过的“最好”的主意
Hell, no.It's the best idea I ever heard.

126
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,063
这家伙是谁?
Who is this guy?

127
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,064
Locke上校  这条线安全吗?
Colonel, is this line secure?

128
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:12,044
安全  GL 12 说吧
Line secure. GL-12, go ahead.

129
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,083
目标地点已获悉
Target area is acquired.

130
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:18,009
1300小时后 军事演戏开始 重复一遍 我们已准备好行动
Maneuvers are a go for 1300 hours. Repeat: We are a go.

131
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:22,032
收到 我们将在1300小时后在指定地点集合
Roger that. We'll convene at the usual rendezvous point at 1300 hours.

132
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:27,000
Locke! 我告诉过你要把TPS报告在今天中午之前准备好
Locke! I told you I need those TPS reports done by noon today.

133
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,090
不是12:30  不是12:15  就中午
Not 12:30, not 12:15. Noon.

134
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,098
你才第一次跟我说  Randy
I heard you the first time, Randy.

135
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:34,002
上班时间不准打私人电话  少校
And no personal calls during office hours, colonel.

136
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,064
那么...
So...

137
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:53,099
准备好捕野猪了  恩?
...hunting boar now, huh?

138
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,060
谁说这是我第一次捕野猪?
Who says this is my first time boar hunting?

139
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,024
告诉我
Tell me

140
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:03,023
为什么我们一旦要深入到丛林内部  你就一定跟来?
how come anytime there's a hike into the heart of darkness, you sign up?

141
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:05,064
里面有什么  你知道的!!
You know what's in there.

142
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,009
事实是  我不知道...
Actually, I don't.

143
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,068
你也不知道
And neither do you.

144
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,018
你对我们的新朋友感觉怎么样?
What's your feel on our new friend?

145
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,077
他看起来很清楚自己在干什么
He seems to know what he's doing.

146
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:20,088
你可以说我多虑  但一个扛着一整箱刀子的人...
Call me paranoid, but anyone who packs a suitcase full of knives...

147
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:22,093
可能是我不知情
If I didn't know any better

148
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,032
我想你是在担心我  Jack
I'd say you're worried about me.

149
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,039
可能我也不知情
If I didn't know better

150
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:28,019
我想说  你是不是不能在一个地方呆的久一点 Kate
 I'd say you have a problem staying in one place.

151
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,021
所以  告诉我 为什么你也去?
You wanna tell me why you're really going?

152
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:43,026
Sayid给了我这个 然后他就能三角定位我们接收过的那个求救信号
Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate the distress signal we heard.

153
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,018
找出信号发射地
Find the source.

154
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:47,033
这和野猪无关?
This isn't about boars?

155
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,015
我是素食者
I'm a vegetarian.

156
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,085
为什么我不能去?
But why can't I come?

157
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:55,019
因为我说了不能去
Cause I said so.

158
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,007
瞧 我...
Look

159
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,017
要离开...
I am going off away to

160
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,005
去打猎
hunt

161
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,000
并且 呃...
and

162
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:17,035
我在想你是否...
I was wondering if you...

163
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,042
呃  是否能
if you

164
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:23,043
照看我的孩子
you could keep an eye on my boy

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,004
这是Walt
Walt

166
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,069
我是Michael
And I'm Michael.

167
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,049
不管怎么说  你能帮我照管孩子吗
Anyway, could you watch him for me

168
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:35,043
直到我回来?
until I come back?

169
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:44,074
抱歉  我听不懂  但你答应了  是吗?
Sorry, I don't understand, but you're cool with this, right?

170
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,079
我不要临时保姆
I don't need a baby-sitter

171
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,045
拜托  Vincent需要你呆在这儿
Come on, man. Vincent needs you here.

172
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:52,017
嘿  开心一点
Hey, cheer up.

173
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:54,081
对我来说这是个可以更好的了解你的朋友Locke先生的好机会
This will give me a chance to get to know your friend Mr. Locke.

174
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,035
不管你说什么  是的
Yeah. Whatever.

175
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:12,062
打扰一下
Excuse me.

176
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,033
我是Jack
It's Jack.

177
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:19,017
-Claire 对吧?  -是的
-Claire, right?  -Yeah.

178
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:23,046
-(孩子)怎么样...  -哦 他很好 谢谢
-How's the...?  -Oh, he's good.Yeah. Thanks.

179
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:27,091
我想你应该看看这个
I thought maybe you should see this.

180
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:29,050
有人在那儿找到的
Someone found it in there.

181
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:31,064
他们正在收集所有的物品
They're collecting all the belongings.

182
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:37,096
Steve和Kristen  他们正在讨论结婚事宜
They're wedding plans for Steve and Kristen.

183
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:41,039
飞机上  他们就坐在我身后的几排
They were on the plane sitting a couple of rows behind me.

184
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,082
我还记得他们  是因为他们看起来开心极了
I remember because they looked so happy.

185
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:47,081
我不明白Claire 我不知道该怎么做
I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with this.

186
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:51,080
我们当中一些人在想  是否应该...
well, some of us were wondering if maybe we should

187
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:54,047
搞个悼念仪式或其它什么的
do some kind of memorial service or something.

188
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,067
你可以做个指导
You could lead it.

189
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:02,077
-不 我不认为...  -你知道 说几句话就行了
-No, I don't think...  -Well, you know, just a few words

190
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:07,067
或者直接念一下护照或者驾照上的名字也行...
or even we could just read off names from passports and driver's...

191
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:08,073
听着  这不是我份内的事
Look, it's not my thing.

192
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:10,057
好吧
okay.

193
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,025
那我来做吧
Maybe I'll do it.

194
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:18,052
好的  主意不错 大家想干什么 干什么
Yeah. Sounds fine.Whatever everybody wants.

195
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:39,096
那个女的还坐在那儿
That woman is still sitting there.

196
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:42,081
-她丈夫也在飞机上  -好
-Her husband was on the plane.  -Great.

197
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:44,048
你在听我说话吗?
Are you listening to me?

198
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,016
来个四字短语怎么样: 我不在乎?
What's a four-letter word for "I don't care"?

199
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:50,003
我在想 最好有个人过去和她说说话
I think somebody should talk to her.

200
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,016
我提拔你去 "America"船长
I nominate you, Captain America

201
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:53,093
你就不能帮帮自己?
You just can't help yourself,can you?

202
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,002
不能  至少
Yeah, well, at least

203
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:58,030
在我的照顾下  你不用担心饿着肚子
You don't have to worry about starving with me taking care of you.

204
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,046
我才不会饿着肚子
I'm not gonna starve.

205
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:02,073
好吧  那你吃什么?
Right. What are you gonna eat?

206
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,078
海里面全是鱼
Ocean's full of fish.

207
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,090
跟你说也是白说
Hate to break it to you.

208
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:13,041
大海是不会买你的帐的
The ocean is not gonna take your gold card.

209
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:16,045
你真的认为我一条鱼都抓不到?
You really don't think I can catch a fish?

210
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,080
找到什么了吗?
You find something?

211
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,049
这地已经被猪鼻子拱过了
The ground here has been rooted up.

212
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:28,061
这就是野猪食物的主要来源: 挖掘
That's how boars get the majority of their food. They dig.

213
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:33,002
然后  他们会把食物放在地上磨滚对着树反复摩擦
Afterwards, they generally wallow in the dirt and rub up against the trees,

214
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,002
最后用獠牙取出食物
scoring it with their tusks.

215
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,021
好的
Okay.

216
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:37,082
那么你是什么意思?
So, what's all that mean?

217
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:39,066
意味着我们离野猪不远了
It means we're close.

218
00:14:57,091 --> 00:15:00,013
-Shannon 对吧?  -是的
-Shannon, right?  -Yeah.

219
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,071
你在做什么吗?
Are you doing anything?

220
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,032
我? 不 我只是 呃... 你在做什么?
Me? No, I was just...What are you doing?

221
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:11,040
我只是随便逛逛
I was just gonna go for a walk.

222
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:19,002
-想一块儿来吗?  -哦 好的 当然
-You want to come?  -Yeah. Yes.Sure.

223
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,044
我能问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you something?

224
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,041
我在想你什么时候能爬上来(乐队的地位提升)
I wondered when this was gonna come up.

225
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:32,000
-是的 我在乐队里是个低音吉他手....  -你知道怎么钓鱼吗?
-Yes, I am the bass guitarist in... -Do you know anything about fishing?

226
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:33,039
什么? 钓...钓鱼?
What? Fishing?

227
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,043
我祖父曾带我出去他把他知道的都教给了我
My granddad used to take me out.Taught me everything he knows.

228
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:41,023
教给我他知道的每件事他现在已经去世了 上帝保佑他
Everything he knew.He's dead now, God rest his soul.

229
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:44,072
是的  我就像一个 ...一个钓鱼能手
Yeah, I'm like a...I'm a fishing fiend.

230
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,021
你知道  我意思是 英国是个岛国
You know,I mean, England's an island

231
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,090
我甩出线就可以钓鱼
so I just throw it in and fish.

232
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:52,082
很好
Good.

233
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,059
医生  你有空吗?
doc, you got a second?

234
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,085
那位女士一个人坐那儿很久了
That woman's been sitting over there by herself.

235
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:08,022
或许她在不停的思念她的丈夫
Maybe she's having trouble dealing with her husband.

236
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,066
我想她已经很久没吃过或喝过东西了
I don't think she's had anything to eat or drink.

237
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:13,080
或许你可以过去和她谈谈?
Think maybe you could go talk to her?

238
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,057
干吗要我过去? 我不是精神科医生 你去吧...
Why me? I'm not a psychiatrist.Maybe you should...

239
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,098
我以为你会想要这么做
Just thought you might want to do it.

240
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:22,084
是你救了她的命
You're the one that saved her life.

241
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:42,098
Rose  对吧?
Rose, right?

242
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:53,089
23A座位的  我是...
Seat 23A. I was...

243
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,022
飞机遇上气流时 我是那个叫你不要担心的家伙
the guy that told you not to worry about the turbulence.

244
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:03,027
大家都很担心你  Rose
Everybody's getting pretty worried about you, Rose.

245
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:05,061
如果你喜欢独处  可以
You want to be alone, fine

246
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,026
但你得照顾好自己
but take care of yourself.

247
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:10,001
你真的应该喝点水
You should really drink.

248
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,018
好吧
Okay.

249
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,015
我们不一定要说话
We don't have to talk.

250
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:20,087
就这样坐一会儿也行
Let's just sit... for a while.

251
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,074
你儿子...他怎么看待这件事?
How's your son?How's he handling all this?

252
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,092
他比我更好过
A hell of a lot better than I am.

253
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:36,070
你一定很骄傲  他是个勇敢的孩子
You must be proud.He's a brave kid.

254
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,081
是的  但这不是我的功劳
Yeah. I can't take credit for that.

255
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:41,007
他的生活中一直没有我
I wasn't part of his life

256
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:43,012
直到两周前他妈妈过世
till his mother passed away two weeks ago.

257
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:45,082
-我很抱歉 我还不知道  -没事
-I'm sorry. I didn't know.  -That's okay.

258
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,018
过去的几年 他们一直住在悉尼
They were living in Sydney the past couple of years.

259
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:50,030
上周我飞过去...
I flew out last week

260
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,031
接他们
to go get him.

261
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,056
你在澳大利亚干什么?
What were you doing?

262
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,056
嘘!
Shh.

263
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:56,096
讨厌你老是用手指  点来点去
quit giving us the steal signal.

264
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,051
糟透了
It's bad.

265
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,011
行动
Move.

266
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:40,026
你得行动  少校
You've got to move, colonel.

267
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:43,080
你的部队正在穿越敌线
Your troops are across enemy lines.

268
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,075
忍耐
Patience

269
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:47,061
你最缺乏的一种品质
a quality which you lack

270
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:50,027
是作为一个领导者的必要品质 GL 12
is the hallmark of a leader.GL-12

271
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,082
必要品质?
Hallmark?

272
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,095
多给我讲些领导的事,Locke.
Tell me more about being a leader, Locke.

273
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:00,083
讲的同时
And while you're at it

274
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,081
顺便跟我说说"少校"的事
tell me about this colonel thing

275
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,031
在人事资源部 我仔细看过你的简历
I perused your file in Human Resources.

276
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,035
你从没参加过什么军队
You've never been in any of the armed forces.

277
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:09,068
我在玩游戏  Randy
I'm just playing a game, Randy.

278
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:12,026
这是我的午休时间   我可以玩游戏
It's my lunch hour.I can play a game.

279
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,010
是的
Yeah.

280
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:17,002
告诉我  什么是"徒步旅行"?
Tell me, what's a walkabout?

281
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:22,073
经历所谓澳大利亚内地的梦幻之旅
"Experience the dream journeys of the fabled Australian outback."

282
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:24,097
你没有权力在我桌子上拿东西
You have no right taking that off my desk.

283
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:30,049
还有你们四处打猎 寻找食物 对吧?
So you wander around hunting and gathering food, right?

284
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:32,028
徒步?
On foot?

285
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,073
你是不会明白的
Not that you would understand

286
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:37,018
徒步旅行是一种精神再生的旅行
but a walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal

287
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:39,019
人可以从大地得到力量
where one derives strength

288
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:41,048
从而和大地变得不可分离
from the earth and becomes inseparable from it.

289
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:43,016
我有假期
I have vacation days.

290
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,044
我要去  Randy  我已经预定好了
I'm going, Randy.I already made a reservation.

291
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:47,045
John  你真的要做?
Wow, John,you're really doing it?

292
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:48,088
你告诉Helen了吗?
You tell Helen yet?

293
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,086
是谁  Locke?
What's this, Locke?

294
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,037
你生命中不是有个女人了吗?
You've got a woman in your life.

295
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:56,050
这不关你的事
None of your business.

296
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:59,081
你怎么回事  Locke?  你干吗折磨你自己?
What is it with you, Locke?Why do you torture yourself?

297
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:04,084
我意思是 把自己想象成一个猎手? 一个徒步旅行者?
I mean, imagining you're some hunter?And walkabouts?

298
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:07,066
醒醒吧  你什么都干不了的
Wake up.You can't do any of that.

299
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:09,048
Norman Croucher

300
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,007
什么?  Norman什么?
What? Norman what?

301
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:14,044
Norman Croucher    Norman Croucher

302
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,007
截肢者  没有腿
Double amputee, no legs.

303
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:19,001
他爬上了史上最高山
He climbed to the top of Mount Everest.

304
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,084
为什么?  命运决定的
Why? It was his destiny.

305
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:24,046
那就是你所谓的收获  老头?
That's what you think you got, old man?

306
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,015
命运?
Destiny?

307
00:21:29,082 --> 00:21:30,039
只是...
Just...

308
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:34,004
不要再跟我说  我做不了什么...
don't tell me what I can't do...

309
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:36,059
John!  他受伤了
John. He's hurt.

310
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,087
John  你听到我说话了吗?
John? Can you hear me?

311
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,016
Locke!

312
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:44,010
John 你没事吧?
John, you okay?

313
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:51,010
Locke?

314
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:53,023
我没事  我没事
I'm fine.

315
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:56,009
我很好 Helen  风把我吹倒了 就这样
I'm fine, Helen. I just got the wind knocked out of me is all.

316
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:57,053
Helen?

317
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:03,018
是吗?
Did I?

318
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:09,012
那野猪往哪个方向去了?
Which way'd that boar go?

我们得把他带回营地去
We have to get him back to camp.

321
00:22:13,023 --> 00:22:15,066
好的 你把他带回营地  我去追野猪
Yeah, you take him back to camp.I'm gonna get that boar.

322
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,070
你说什么呀?
What are you talking about?

323
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,025
我没事 我能做到
I'm fine. I can do this.

324
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:25,055
John 你不能去
John, you can't.

325
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:28,060
不要再跟我说 我做不了什么
Don't tell me what I can't do.

326
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:33,053
抓到了?

327
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:34,050
伙计...
Dude

328
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,045
不要再这么问了
quit asking me that.

329
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:37,046
抱歉
Sorry.

330
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,082
是你说  你知道怎么抓鱼的!!
It's just you said you knew how to fish.

331
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:42,014
是的  我曾和老爸去Santa Monica码头
Yeah, off the Santa Monica Pier with my old man

332
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:44,073
带上一根鱼竿  一些饵
and a fishing pole and bait.

333
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:47,038
不要指望用尖棒戳到鱼
Never had to try to poke one with a sharp stick.

334
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:54,007
真的很感激你帮我  谢谢
Well... really appreciate you helping me out. Thanks.

335
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:57,057
只要让我远离那机身就行
Hey...anything that keeps me away from that fuselage.

336
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:00,042
抓住那个该死的红脖子蠢蛋
And that freakin' redneck jerk!

337
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:05,098
妈的! 我真是垃圾! 垃圾! 臭婊...
Damn it! Crap! Crap! Son of a...

338
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:07,037
你让我试试?
You want me to have a go?

339
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:10,071
小心点
Knock yourself out.

340
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:12,015
好吧
All right.

341
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,026
好的  这儿有一条
Okay, here comes one.

342
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,014
集中力量
Put your weight into it.

343
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:20,062
放松  等候
Easy. Wait for it.

344
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:23,009
快!
Now!

345
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:28,073
伙计  你得扎中
Dude, you got to try to pin it.

346
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:29,075
你看  我差点就抓到了?
Did you see how close I was?

347
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,033
你说的  别为难它
You said not to corner it.

348
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:48,053
打扰一下
Excuse me.

349
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,030
-你叫Sayid 对吧?  -是的
-Your name's Sayid, right?  -Yes.

350
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,090
我刚找到这个  上面有你的名字
I found this.It's got your name on it.

351
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:00,095
我还以为没了
I thought I'd lost this.

352
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:03,044
-谢谢  -不客气
-Thank you.  -Sure.

353
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:36,034
他的手指会肿胀
His fingers swell.

354
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,014
什么?
Sorry?

355
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:43,004
Bernard  我的丈夫
Bernard. My husband.

356
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:46,004
我们一上飞机  他的手指就肿胀
His hands swell up whenever we fly.

357
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:48,079
海拔的缘故
The altitude.

358
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:54,084
所以一旦我们乘飞机旅行他就叫我拿着他的结婚戒指
He started having me hold on to his wedding ring whenever we took a plane trip.

359
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:58,048
我总是把它带在脖子上 怕弄丢了
I always wore it around my neck for safekeeping

360
00:24:58,053 --> 00:24:59,095
直到飞机着陆
just until we landed.

361
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:08,097
我要你知道  医生  你不必兑现承诺的!
You know, doctor, you don't have to keep your promise.

362
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,014
在飞机上你给我的承诺.....
The one you made me on the plane

363
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:17,088
说给我作个伴  直到我丈夫从洗手间出来?
to keep me company until my husband got back from the restroom?

364
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:20,090
我允许你从这个困扰中走出去
I'm letting you off the hook.

365
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:26,059
你不能这么轻易的甩掉我
Well, you're not gonna get rid of me that easily.

366
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:31,072
Rose  你不应该一个人呆在这儿
Rose, you shouldn't be out here alone.

367
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,016
你刚遭受过猛烈的冲击
You're suffering from post-traumatic shock.

368
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:37,030
我们不是都遭受了吗?
Aren't we all?

369
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,051
是的  我们都遭受了
Yeah, I guess we are.

370
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:48,003
你人很好
You have a nice way about you.

371
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:51,034
有颗好的心灵
A good soul.

372
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,061
有耐心  关爱他人
Patient, caring.

373
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:58,004
我想这就是你为什么成为了医生
I suppose that's why you became a doctor.

374
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,064
谢谢  但是...
Thanks, but...

375
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:03,037
事实是  这和祖传有关
I was just kinda born into it.

376
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,056
家族事业
Family business.

377
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:22,026
我从没感受过 我这么有活力
I have never felt so alive.

378
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:26,090
终于告诉了Randy我要离开 真的是...
Getting to finally tell Randy off was...

379
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:30,043
... 生命的变迁
...life-changing.

380
00:26:31,037 --> 00:26:32,012
我说真的
I mean it.

381
00:26:33,004 --> 00:26:36,058
现在我可以自由自在的做我想做的事
Now I'm free to do all those things I ever wanted to do,

382
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:39,071
做我命中注定要做的事
things that I know I was destined to do,

383
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,000
就像我们讨论过的那样  Helen
like we talked about, Helen.

384
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:44,024
太棒了 John  我真替你高兴
It's wonderful, John. I'm happy for you. Really.

385
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,091
我还没告诉你最精彩的部分
I haven't even told you the best part.

386
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:49,002
你还记得那个...
Do you remember the...

387
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,069
真实的原始徒步旅行吗?
...authentic aboriginal walkabout?

388
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:55,076
当然  你说了好几周了
Sure. That's all you've talked about for weeks.

389
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,022
是的   我打算去尝试
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do it.

390
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:01,095
这周末  我要飞往澳大利亚
I'm flying to Australia at the end of the week.

391
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,031
而且我已经 ...
And I've...

392
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,056
我买了两张票子
I bought two tickets.

393
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:13,075
Helen?

394
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:16,071
-John 我们已经谈过了  -是的 我知道
-John, we've talked about this.  -Yeah. I know.

395
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:18,033
我喜欢你  我也喜欢过去的几个月里和你谈论的这些事情
I like you. I've enjoyed talking these past months.

396
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:20,012
我也是  8个月了
So have I. Eight months

397
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:21,099
我不允许去见顾客
I'm not allowed to meet customers.

398
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:25,008
顾客?
A customer?

399
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:26,082
对你...
Is...?

400
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:29,083
对你来说  我就是个顾客而已?
Is that what I am to you?

401
00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:33,045
这非比寻常  我是说  这不是我要做的
This isn't really normal. I mean, it isn't what I do.

402
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,051
或许你应该找一个...我说不清楚...治疗师?!
Maybe you should find a, I don't know, therapist.

403
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:40,076
-我有一个治疗师了  -John...
-I have a therapist.  -John...

404
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:44,038
我还以为你会明白的  Helen
I thought you understood.

405
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:45,079
你了解我  比任何人都清楚
You know me better than anyone.

406
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:46,095
John  如果我们再接着谈的话
If we talk longer

407
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:48,084
你得多付一个小时的钱了
I'm gonna charge you for another hour

408
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:50,084
又要89.95美圆
That's another $89.95.

409
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:53,010
听着 我才不在乎钱!我只是...
I don't care about the money! I just...

410
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:54,067
我很抱歉 John  我得走了
I'm sorry, John. I got to go.

411
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:58,007
Helen! Helen!

412
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:12,029
等等
wait a minute.

413
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,087
在这休息会儿
Just rest here for a minute.

414
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:17,065
那个瘸腿的家伙应该给我们安排好休息地
I thought the guy with the gimpy leg should be deciding when we rest.

415
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,067
你做什么?
Hey, what are you doing?

416
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,073
试着调测一下信号
Trying to boost the transceiver signal.

417
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:28,026
我得爬上树去
I'm gonna climb this tree...

418
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:30,055
把天线安置在那儿
...and attach an antenna.

419
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:33,053
-你要爬这个?  -是的
-You're gonna climb that?   -Yeah.

420
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:36,030
别担心
Don't worry.

421
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,005
爬树对你不好
Climbed a lot worse.

422
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,031
Locke

423
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:18,066
这些是...
These were...

424
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,019
前些天我找到的  当时我在...
I found these the other day when I was...

425
00:30:25,077 --> 00:30:27,068
不管了  收下就是了
Hell, just take it.

426
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:29,055
谢谢
Thank you.

427
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,020
什么...那是什么?
What is that?

428
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:49,027
我懂了  牙膏一样的东西
I get it.It's like toothpaste.

429
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,055
爸爸!
Dad!

430
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:05,068
发生什么事了?
So, like, what happened out there?

431
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:07,062
爸爸! 
Dad!

432
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:10,031
你的腿看起来糟透了  痛吗?
Your leg's messed up. Does it hurt?

433
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,062
没事儿  没看起来那么糟
It's okay. Not as bad as it looks

434
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:16,009
勇猛的女猎手回来了
The mighty huntress returns.

435
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,051
-晚餐吃什么 宝贝儿?  -还没到时候
-What's for dinner, honey?  -Not now.

436
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,094
这么说你和野猪打架喽?
It was a boar fight?

437
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,007
算不上打架  是蹂躏啦
Not so much a fight.

438
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,045
就像我被它狼吞虎咽
It was more, you know, like me getting gored.

439
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:31,005
那...Locke先生在哪?
So, where's Mr. Locke?

440
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,023
我觉得打猎进展的并不顺利
I don't think the hunt went well.

441
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,072
那个光头佬还没回来
That bald guy never came back.

442
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,055
他们什么食物都没带回来?
They didn't bring back any food?

443
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:45,097
你听到我说什么了吗?
Did you hear what I said?

444
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,041
很可能有人死在那儿不回来了
Somebody might have died.

445
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,068
是的  但是如果他们不做些什么  我们都会死的
We'll die if somebody doesn't do something.

446
00:31:49,077 --> 00:31:50,048
给你
There you are.

447
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:52,013
我保证过的
As promised

448
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:54,086
今晚你和我将有一顿丰盛的海鲜大餐
you and I will be dining on fresh catch of the day.

449
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:55,075
老天!
My fish!

450
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,083
希望你不会介意我把鱼弄成这样吧
Hope you don't mind alfresco.

451
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:57,095
是的  这不成问题
It was no problem.

452
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,042
你知道吗?  事实上 这鱼花了我好大力气啊
That one gave me a hell of a tussle

453
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,028
但你知道  你必须知道鱼在想什么?
but you have to get inside the mind of the fish.

454
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:04,081
-我不相信  -我呆在浅水处  把它逼到角落
-I don't believe you.  -I cornered it.

455
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,063
又怎么了?  不忍看到我自力更生啊?
What's the matter? Can't stand to see me fending for myself?

456
00:32:07,073 --> 00:32:09,075
-对这件事 我真的感到很抱歉  -没事
-I am so sorry about this. Seriously.  -It's okay.

457
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:11,039
-你向他倒什么歉?  -替你道歉
-What are you apologizing for?  -For you

458
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:13,021
为你像摆弄别人一样摆弄他道歉
For using this poor guy.

459
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,001
随你怎么说
Oh, whatever.

460
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,056
你脑子里错乱的某根神经
In your twisted brain

461
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:18,042
你认为 这证明你可以照顾你自己了
you think this proves.you can take care of yourself.

462
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:21,075
我告诉过我会抓到一条鱼 不是吗?
I told you I'd catch a fish, didn't I?

463
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:23,020
这是很低贱的行为 Shannon  对你来说也是
That's low, even for you.

464
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,029
去救幼鸟或其它什么吧
Oh, go rescue a baby bird or something.

465
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:36,010
Rose  太阳下山后
Rose, after the sun goes down,

466
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:38,069
我们将烧掉机身
we're gonna burn the fuselage.

467
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:42,065
这是我们必须得做的
It's just something that we have to do.

468
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,079
然后我们会在营地搞个悼念仪式
There's gonna be a memorial service back at the camp for those...

469
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:49,002
为那些没有活下来的人
...for those who didn't make it

470
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:50,038
向他们告别
for everyone to say goodbye

471
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:55,006
今晚我会去的
I'd like to be there for that.

472
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:09,049
你知道  或许你想对你的丈夫说些什么
Maybe if you wanted to say something,You know, about your husband.

473
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,019
什么?
What?

474
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:13,039
我说  如果你想对Bernard说再见的话
I'm saying, if you wanted to say goodbye to Bernard.

475
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:16,075
医生  我丈夫没死
Doctor, my husband is not dead.

476
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,001
Rose  他是在飞机的尾舱
Rose, he was in the tail section of the plane.

477
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,033
飞行的时候尾舱折断了
It broke off in mid-flight.

478
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,005
很抱歉  只是那半节机身里的人都不见了
I'm sorry, but everyone who was in the rear of the plane is gone.

479
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:33,095
他们很可能也在想"我们都已经死了"
They're probably thinking the same thing about us.

480
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:53,033
医生?
Doctor?

481
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:55,067
一块去吗?
You coming?

482
00:34:13,043 --> 00:34:14,041
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

483
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:17,059
我想我本应该向你保证的
Guess I should have gotten the warranty.

484
00:34:21,078 --> 00:34:23,032
我还会再试一次
I suppose I'll just try again.

485
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:26,036
当然  我已经没有焊锡了
Of course, I have no welding iron

486
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:27,049
没有锍钉
no rivets

487
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:28,072
没有绞线
scorched wiring

488
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:30,089
看来我还得对....
and it seems I must continue to

489
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:33,022
每个问我在干什么的人撒谎
lie to anyone who asks me what I'm actually doing!

490
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:35,008
Sayid...

491
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:44,034
我们再试一次
We'll try it again.

492
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:50,065
我们再试一次
We'll try it again.

493
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,052
Kate!

494
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,099
你是不是要说"我告诉过你别去的"?
Is this when you say "I told you so"?

495
00:35:10,017 --> 00:35:12,019
不 我才不会这么浇冷水
No. I'm not big on rubbing it in.

496
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:21,086
Locke ...

497
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:25,000
Locke不见了
Locke's gone.

498
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:29,000
那东西  朝他冲去
That thing,it was moving in his direction.

499
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,095
马上就要烧机身了
Fuselage is ready to go.

500
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,095
有些人决定...
Some of the others decided...

501
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,061
我想烧的时候会有些悼词
I guess there's gonna be some words said over the fire.

502
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:53,032
-这很好  -还有念名字  我想
-That's good.  -Names read, I think.

503
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,085
我想他们还没准备好  听我们讲一些....
I don't think they're ready to hear about some things...

504
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:04,060
Jack?

505
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,020
Locke

506
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:44,058
来自德克萨斯 丹顿的Judith Martha Wexler
Judith Martha Wexler from Denton, Texas.

507
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:50,029
估计她是去转机
I guess she was gonna catch a connecting flight.

508
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:56,063
她戴矫正眼镜
She wore corrective lenses

509
00:36:58,011 --> 00:37:00,025
她还是个器官捐赠者
and she was an organ donor.

510
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:04,024
至少她曾经是
Or at least would have been.

511
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:07,093
Steve和Kristen
Steve and Kristen.

512
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:11,012
我不知道他们的姓 但是 ...
I don't know their last name, but...

513
00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:16,038
他们真的很相爱 并且马上就要结婚了
they were really in love and were gonna be married.

514
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,089
不管他们现在在哪
At least wherever they are now

515
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:21,073
他们已经不再孤独
they're not alone

516
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:49,003
看起来  他很少旅行
Looks like he hadn't traveled much

517
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:52,053
至少从护照上看得出来
as far as I can tell from his passport.

518
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:55,014
看到Jack了吗?
You seen Jack?

519
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,047
干的漂亮
Nice work.

520
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:23,043
什么?
What?

521
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,059
你知道的 干得很漂亮
Nice work, you know.

522
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,054
刚还在想  我该为你说些什么
Just thought I should say something.

523
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,076
所以  那东西...那 ...
So, that thing... the...

524
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:39,078
怪物  或其它什么...
...monster, whatever

525
00:38:40,046 --> 00:38:42,023
她说它朝你冲过去
she said it was headed right towards you.

526
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,019
看到了吗?
Get any kind of look at it?

527
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,038
没有
No.

528
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,085
我们安排的徒步旅行
The walkabouts we arrange

529
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:03,086
不只是一种像散步穿过公园那么简单
here are not just some stroll through the park.

530
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:06,020
这是一种长途跋涉  得穿越广阔无垠的沙漠
It's trekking across stretches of desert

531
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:07,077
渡过激流横飞  险象环生的河流
rafting treacherous waters...

532
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:10,049
你根本不知道你在和什么样的人说话
You've got no idea who you're talking to.

533
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:13,028
我很清楚我要做的  相信我
I'm well aware of what's involved, believe me.

534
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:15,030
关于徒步旅行  很可能我知道的比你还多
I probably know more than you.

535
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,084
即使是对一个身强力壮的人来说  这都是一种严酷的考验
It's a trying ordeal for someone in peak physical condition.

536
00:39:19,002 --> 00:39:20,071
听着  我一个月前就预定了这次旅行
I booked this tour a month ago.

537
00:39:20,078 --> 00:39:23,073
我已经付了钱  现在你得在车子上给我留个位置
You've got my money.I demand a place.

538
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,099
你误导了大家
You misrepresented yourself.

539
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:27,035
-我从没撒过谎  -你疏忽了 Locke先生
-I never lied.  -By omission. Mr. Locke.

540
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:29,061
你漏了告诉我们你的身体状况
You neglected to tell us about your condition.

541
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:31,072
我的身体状况不成问题
My condition is not an issue.

542
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,021
四年来我的身体状况都这样
I've lived with it for four years.

543
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:34,060
这从来没妨碍过我做任何事
Never kept me from doing anything.

544
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,047
不幸的是  对保险公司来说  这就是个问题
Unfortunately, it is an issue for our insurance company.

545
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:40,042
我不能再让汽车等下去了  这对别人很不公平...
I can't keep the bus waiting.It isn't fair...

546
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,023
