3
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:06,043
先生?
Sir?

4
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:10,002
请开一下门
I'm gonna have to ask that you open the door, please.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,019
我们能不能谈些其它的事?
How about we talk about that other thing?

6
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:23,038
如你们所知  阿拉伯人靠他的破接收机检测到了信号
You know, the transmission Abdul picked up on his little radio.

7
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:26,006
信号中的法国妞说  "他们都已经死了"
The french chick that said "they're all dead."

8
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:27,078
我们回到岸边后就得把这一切告诉他们
We have to tell the others when we get back.

9
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:29,069
什么事都不能跟他们说
No one's going to tell them anything.

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,080
如果我们把知道的都告诉了他们
If we tell them what we know

11
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:33,022
我们会夺走他们仅存的希望
we take away their hope.

12
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,073
所以  我们得说谎了
So we lie.

13
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:50,084
现在我已经找到了淡水 就在山谷里
Now I found fresh water up in the valley.

14
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,044
我会先带一队人上去取水
I'll take a group in at first light.

15
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:55,037
如果你不想来  做点其它事也可以 只要能为团队做贡献就行
If you don't want to go, then find another way to contribute,

16
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,042
因为要是只顾自己的话在这里已经行不通了
because every man for himself is not gonna work.

17
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,078
打扰一下
excuse me.

18
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:02,064
你看到我的孩子了吗?
have you seen my boy?

19
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:18,083
我... 要... 去打猎
I... am going off... away to a hunt.

20
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,059
我在想你是否...
And I was wondering if you...

21
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:25,001
能够...帮忙照看一下我的孩子
could, keep an eye on my boy

22
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,081
直到我打猎回来
until I come back.

23
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,055
你不介意  是吧?
You're cool with this, right?

24
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,075
我不是想问你私人问题
It's not like I'm asking you a personal question.

25
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:00,087
我只是想知道...
Ijust want to know.

26
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:03,025
-你没必要知道  -说出来听听又有什么关系?
-Well, you're not gonna know.  -What's the big deal?

27
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:05,057
是没什么关系 只不过我干了些事罢了
It's not a big deal. It's just something I did.

28
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:07,085
有些事我搞不明白不得不在那儿解决
I have my reasons, and I don't want to put it out there.

29
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:09,012
只是你的为人
It's just that you

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,044
和你的纹身似乎并不匹配
and your tattoos don't add up.

31
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:19,033
你属于那种中坚的脊骨外科医生?
Are you one of those hardcore spinal surgeons?

32
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:22,076
说的对  "中坚力量"
That's me. Hardcore.

33
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:26,014
你俩说完了吧 我们得出发了
If you guys are finished verbally copulating, we should get a move on.

34
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,016
整个海滩的人都在等着我们取水
There's a whole beach of people waiting for us to get some drinking water for them.

35
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,073
那打猎高手根本不用休息
And the great white hunter's getting restless.

36
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:35,023
好吧  我们出发
Okay, let's do this.

37
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,081
Charlie

38
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,042
问问Jack关于纹身的事
ask Jack about his tattoos.

39
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:42,077
你们还有内部笑话啊
you guys have an inside joke.

40
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,068
你俩可真行啊
How absolutely wonderful for you both.

41
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,078
想要杯香槟吗?

42
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,078
你有东西落下了

43
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,078
真的吗?

44
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:44,078
是什么呢?

45
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,045
我的父亲?

46
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:57,048
他现在忙着做东呢

47
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:01,048
我们得离开这里  现在就走

48
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:03,048
去哪儿呢?

49
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:04,048
美国

50
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:08,078
Sun  看着我  我爱你...

51
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:12,008
但我不想和你私奔

52
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:14,078
这是我们唯一的机会了

53
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,048
你父亲永远都不会同意的

54
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,008
他又没权利来同意这是我们的决定

55
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,008
我会去跟你父亲谈的

56
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:24,048
我会让他明白的

57
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:29,018
你这样说就是因为你不了解我父亲的为人

58
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,018
但你了解我呀

59
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:40,038
真漂亮

60
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,028
我希望它能变成一块钻石

61
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:46,098
相信有一天会的

62
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:06,068
出什么事了?

63
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:12,004
怎么...
what the...

64
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:13,048
住手! 住手!
Stop! stop!

65
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:21,099
求你放开他!
Get off of him! Please!

66
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,083
住手!
Stop!

67
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,070
住手!放开他!
Stop! Get off of him!

68
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:32,057
你做点什么呀! 他会杀了我爸的!
Do something! He's gonna kill him!

69
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,026
求你让他停手!
Stop him, please!

70
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:58,010
让他停手呀!
Stop him, please!

71
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,050
他会杀了他的!
He's gonna kill him!

72
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:17,021
用军官的手铐铐住他!
The handcuffs from the sky marshal!Now!

73
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,050
怎么回事?
What happened?

74
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,045
水在这边
Water's this way.

75
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:54,049
怎么给你找到这地方的?
How'd you find this place?

76
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,067
运气
Luck.

77
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,049
就这儿
This is it.

78
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,094
不可思议
It's amazing.

79
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,083
是的  和你一样另人惊奇
Absolutely. It's totally you.

80
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,033
伙计们?
guys?

81
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,011
要不要在这找找?
Shouldn't someone look through this stuff?

82
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:47,073
或许能找到些有用的东西
Could be something useful in here.

83
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:49,049
他真有头脑
He's got a point.

84
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,061
-是吗?  -是的
-I do?  -Yeah.

85
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:52,075
把你的瓶子给我
Bring me your bottles

86
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,071
留意一下医疗用品  尤其是药
Keep an eye out for any medical supplies, drugs in particular.

87
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,056
药?  好的
Drugs. Right.

88
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,047
不要动
Don't move.

89
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:35,093
-听着,我只是想....  -不要动
-Look, I was just gonna take  -Do not move.

90
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:39,016
-发生什么事了?  -嘘...
-What's going on?  -Shh.

91
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:42,031
他站在一个蜂窝上面
He's standing on a beehive.

92
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:46,010
蜂窝怎么会在这儿?
What's a beehive doing there?

93
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,087
不是应该在树上的吗!
Beehives are supposed to be in trees.

94
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:50,079
现在该怎么办?
What now?

95
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,052
如果他动一下  会把蜂窝弄破的
If he moves, he'll split the hive.

96
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,081
我一点儿都不喜欢蜜蜂  明白?
I don't like bees, okay?

97
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:56,001
我对蜜蜂有种无名的恐惧
I have an irrational fear of bees

98
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:57,079
-我想我会过敏  -安静点儿
-I think I'm allergic to bees.  -Please be quiet.

99
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,075
得找东西把蜂窝封起来
We need to get something to seal the hive.

100
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,074
-盖住它?  -是的  快!
-To cover it?  -Yeah. Hurry!

101
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:08,093
我已经说得烦了
I'm getting tired of saying this.

102
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:11,062
刚才  我和儿子正在海边走
I was just walking the beach with my son

103
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:14,029
突然  那野人向我扑来
and all of a sudden this dude is all up on me.

104
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,056
我什么事都没做过
I didn't do anything.

105
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:24,093
有些事  你当然不会告诉我们
Surely there must be something you're not telling us.

106
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:26,018
当真?!
Surely?!

107
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:27,099
你哪里人  伙计?!
Where you from, man?!

108
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,033
提克里特
Tikrit.

109
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,020
伊拉克
Iraq.

110
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,088
好吧  我不知道在伊拉克碰到这种情况会怎样
Okay, I don't know how it is in Iraq

111
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,041
但在美国  我的家乡
but in the United States of America where I'm from

112
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,085
韩国人是不喜欢黑人的
korean people don't like black people.

113
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,000
你知不知道?
You know that?

114
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:45,085
要谈话  你应该找他!
So maybe you ought to talk to him!

115
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,062
先铐着再说
The cuffs stay on.

116
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,095
阿拉伯  说大声一点 或许那样她听得懂
A little louder, Omar. Maybe then she'll understand you.

117
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:55,056
伙计们  这样做的话 那中国佬会疯的
Guys, that chinese dude's gonna get pretty crispy out here.

118
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:57,039
你们要铐他到什么时候?
How long you gonna keep him tied down like that?

119
00:09:57,052 --> 00:10:00,044
他差点杀了Michael  大家都看到了
He tried to kill Michael. We all saw it.

120
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,060
等我们搞清楚事情原委再帮他解开
The cuffs stay on until we know why.

121
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,073
儿子  我们走
Come on, man. Let's go.

122
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:34,003
发生什么了?

123
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:36,083
是这样的...

124
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,083
你的父亲...

125
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,083
你的父亲同意了

126
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,068
别再这样了!

127
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:56,068
你怎么办到的?

128
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:58,068
我跟他讲道理啊

129
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:02,018
经过一年的管理业务训练

130
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:04,078
外加在工厂做工一年

131
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,078
我们需要的钱都赚到了

132
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:09,038
你要帮我爸干活?

133
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:10,078
这样做是对的

134
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:13,078
我不得不这样做

135
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:18,028
这只是临时的

136
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:35,028
你可买不起这个的

137
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:39,018
现在可以了哦

138
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,037
好
Okay.

139
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,004
不要动
Just keep still, man.

140
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:17,003
我想办法把蜂窝盖起来
I'm gonna try to cover the hive.

141
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:20,026
这真是个馊主意  不管用的
This is the most crap idea ever.It's never gonna work.

142
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,094
合作一点  孩子
Pull yourself together, son.

143
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,068
即使我合作了
It wouldn't be an irrational fear of bees

144
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,083
还是消除不了我对蜜蜂的恐惧难道不是吗?
if I could just pull myself together, would it?

145
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,058
他是谁?  怎么会在这儿?
Who is he? How'd he get here?

146
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,058
虽然不能解剖尸体  但是
Can't exactly perform an autopsy,but

147
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,062
看起来并不像是由严重骨伤引起的
doesn't seem to be any major trauma to the bones.

148
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,077
这儿还有一具
There's another one over here.

149
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,012
有人把他们搁在这儿休息
Someone laid them to rest here.

150
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:35,091
-谁?  -我不知道
-Who?  -I don't know.

151
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:37,027
他们是从哪儿来的?
Where'd they come from?

152
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:39,044
上周你们不是打死一只北极熊吗?
Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear last week?

153
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,004
是的
Yeah.

154
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,050
熊是从哪里来的?
Where'd that come from?

155
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,011
能否知道这两具尸体放在这儿已经多久了?
Any idea how long they've been here?

156
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:52,049
很长时间了  衣服都腐蚀成这至少有40或50年了
Long. It takes 40 or 50 years for clothing to degrade like this.

157
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,081
那是什么?
What is it?

158
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:07,036
有人吗?
Hello! Anybody there?

159
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:11,015
大家都没事吧?
Everyone all right?

160
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,011
就边上被叮了几口
A few stings aside.

161
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,071
你俩跑得可真快啊!
You two run away fantastically.

162
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:17,070
我跑得慢  蜜蜂都来我这儿了你们才幸以逃脱
Glad my diversion spared you.

163
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,064
只有我  不知道被叮了多少口
I was only stung several hundred times.

164
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:23,083
而且...
and

165
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,080
有人把这个落下了
someone left this.

166
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,090
这...里面都是蜜蜂
It was,it was full of bees.

167
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:33,080
我想应该是"C"罩
I'd have thought c's, actually.

168
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,020
抱歉
Sorry.

169
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,087
天哪
Bloody hell.

170
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,009
原来我们之前  就已经有人来过了
These are the people who were here before us.

171
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:49,013
你说什么?
What are you talking about?

172
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,006
只是...
just

173
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,029
有...
you know, there...

174
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:58,011
这些人应该是在我们之前来的  对吧?
there could have been people here before us, right?

175
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:59,090
当然
Clearly.

176
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,052
这些家伙是什么人?
But who were these men?

177
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,000
事实上  其中一位是女性
Actually, one of them's female.

178
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:12,034
这座孤岛上的亚当和夏娃
Our very own Adam and Eve.

179
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:16,064
你在做什么呀

180
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:18,064
你的皮肤都破了

181
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,064
当心点

182
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,064
觉得怎么样?

183
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,004
喜欢吗?

184
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:14,054
我工作的时间很长我觉得你会喜欢这个伙伴的

185
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:20,034
当然你得训练它  喂养它

186
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,034
你没事吧?

187
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:31,014
记得以前的日子吗?你给我的只是一朵小花

188
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,044
是你父亲的电话

189
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,020
我想我们得留一个帮Charlie整理飞机残骸
I think one of us should stay and help Charlie salvage the wreckage.

190
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:53,022
你想留下?
You offering?

191
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,031
是的
Sure.

192
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:57,036
给自己个机会多了解他一点
Give me a chance to get to know him a little better.

193
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,038
我们得走了
We should move out.

194
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,047
很可能人们已经等得口渴了
People are probably getting thirsty.

195
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:05,067
怎么了?
What?

196
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,001
46个人每人每天得喝掉半加仑水
46 people need to drink a half gallon a day each.

197
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:14,077
扛着这些水跑来跑去实在太痛苦了
Carrying all this water back and forth is gonna be a real pain in the ass.

198
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:16,063
你这么一说我确实是有点后悔了
You're starting to make me regret volunteering.

199
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,093
这些洞穴是个安身的好地方而不像是一个坟地
These caves make too good a shelter just to be used for burial.

200
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:27,004
亚当和夏娃他们一定在这儿住过
Adam and Eve, they must have lived here.

201
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:30,054
可能是飞机坠毁也可能是船只失事
Their plane crashed, or maybe they were shipwrecked.

202
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,084
他们找到了这个地方以为在这儿或许可以活下来
They probably found this place and knew they could survive here.

203
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,036
源源不断的淡水
Unlimited supply of fresh water.

204
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,057
树阴使得温度不会太高
Tree canopy keeps the temperature down

205
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,025
还遮住了太阳
shields out the sun.

206
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:43,053
出口很窄
The openings are narrow.

207
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,062
很容易躲避食肉动物的攻击
Easier for protection against predators.

208
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,050
我们没必要把水带到海边
We don't need to bring the water to the people.

209
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:51,089
我们只需把人们带过来
We need to bring the people to the water.

210
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,031
我想我们可以在这儿居住
I think we could live here.

211
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:20,097
你在干什么?
what are you doing?

212
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,024
你是不是对我儿子说了什么?
You say something to my boy?

213
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:33,032
是的  也很高兴和你谈话
Yeah, nice talking to you, too

214
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:36,001
我们走  Walt
Let's move it, Walt.

215
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,096
他为什么不喜欢我们?
How come he doesn't like us?

216
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:46,020
你刚才说他那种人不喜欢我们
You said people like him don't like people like us.

217
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:49,060
不
No.

218
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:53,015
事情不是这样的  知道吗?
Look, that's...that's not true, and you know what?

219
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:55,062
我也不想这么说的 我只是...
I don't think like that anyway. I was...

220
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,018
我只是生气罢了
I was angry.

221
00:18:58,033 --> 00:18:59,043
你对他做过什么?
What'd you do to him?

222
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,042
我对他做过什么?
What did I do to him?

223
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,085
你说呢!
You tell me.

224
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:05,017
自从飞机失事后 我就一直和你在一起
I've been with you since we crashed.

225
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:08,026
你看到我对什么人做过什么不该做的事吗?
Have you seen me do anything to anyone?

226
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:10,083
你到底是怎么看我的?
What kind of man do you think I am anyway?

227
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,001
你妈妈是不是对你说了什么?
What did your mother say about me?

228
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,045
她从来不和我说你的事儿
She never talked about you.

229
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:22,083
就是说你一点儿都不了解我  是吧?
You don't know anything about me then, do you?

230
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:24,003
你也一样不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

231
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:25,031
我很了解你
I know a lot about you.

232
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,019
-是吗?  -是的
-Yeah?  -Yeah.

233
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:29,081
-我生日什么时候?  -8月24号
-When's my birthday?  -August 24th.

234
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,040
我的呢?
When's mine?

235
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,066
算了  走吧
Forget it. Come on, man.

236
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:47,026
亲爱的  求求你了就让我去跟他们解释一下吧

237
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:50,026
或许他们会放过你的

238
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,026
你要怎么解释?

239
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,026
你就呆在我旁边

240
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:57,026
而且我们也不会跟那个贼解释什么的

241
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:13,096
你没事吧

242
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,026
跟我好好谈谈吧

243
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:24,026
你受伤了?

244
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:26,076
你怎么了?

245
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:29,036
你在做什么呀?

246
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,026
这是谁的血?

247
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:37,066
你在做什么呀?

248
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:40,066
发生什么事了?

249
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,086
我在工作

250
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,066
在做什么事?

251
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,066
你为我爸做的都是些什么事?

252
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:53,066
看着我

253
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,026
回答我

254
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,026
看着我

255
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:10,066
你爸说什么  我就做什么

256
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:15,026
我做的这一切都是为了我们两个

257
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:02,084
你胡思乱想?
You checking me out?

258
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:04,022
什么?
What?

259
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,076
-这么想也没什么坏处  只是  -相信我
-There's no harm in it. I just  -Trust me,

260
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:10,002
如果我那么想  我会让你知道的
if I was checking you out, you'd know it.

261
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,047
是吗?  那么你在想什么?就现在的想法
Yeah? So then what were you thinking? Right now.

262
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:14,007
我发誓我没朝那方面想
Well, I sure as hell wasn't thinking that.

263
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:17,046
继续想...就跟我说吧
Don't stop to think. Just... tell me.

264
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:21,083
我在想
I was thinking

265
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,090
如果我们住在洞边可以在泉水上方筑个水坝
that if we were living at the caves, we could build a damn around that spring

266
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:27,090
那样每个人都可以喝到淡水了
so that everybody could have fresh water

267
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,068
而且医务室也可以搬过来
and we could get the infirmary off the beach.

268
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:32,057
你认为这主意不好?
You think it's a bad idea?

269
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,048
很好  很不错的主意
No, it makes sense.

270
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,034
但?
But?

271
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:41,041
-没有但是  -很好
-No but.  -Good.

272
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:45,010
大部分人一直盼望着救援队的到来
Because a lot of people are still hoping a rescue boat's gonna show up.

273
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,053
他们一点都没考虑过自己的安全问题
They're not thinking about their own safety.

274
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:49,095
我们还有许多说服工作要做
We're gonna have a lot of convincing to do.

275
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,050
我们?
We?

276
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,018
你甚至连我都没说服呢!
You still haven't convinced me yet.

277
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,061
你要跟着我?
You following me?

278
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,002
是的
Yes.

279
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,015
不必了  我只是去上上厕所
There's no need. I'm just going to the loo.

280
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:17,049
你是不是想告诉我一些事情  Charlie?
Is there something you want to tell me, Charlie?

281
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:21,069
我要去厕所
I'm going to the loo.

282
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:23,094
那儿很危险
It's dangerous out there.

283
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,060
在回到岸边之前我不会让你离开我的视线
Until we get back to the beach, I'm not breaking line of sight with you.

284
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,091
离我远点
Bugger off.

285
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:31,049
我知道你是谁 我也知道你在找什么
I know who you are, and I know what you're looking for.

286
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,084
"驱轴乐队"
Driveshaft.

287
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,019
你是低音手
You played bass.

288
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,040
也是吉他手
And guitar.

289
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:42,099
在有几首歌里面弹奏过的
On a couple of tracks.

290
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,039
你真的听说过我们?
You really heard of us?

291
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,008
我是过40了 但也不能说明我是个聋子啊
Hey, just because I'm over 40 doesn't mean I'm deaf.

292
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,077
我有两张你们的专集
I have both your albums.

293
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,023
尽管我认为
Although I thought

294
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:55,023
你的初次登台比"律动的油"(某乐队名)要强多了
that your self-titled debut was a much stronger effort than "oil change."

295
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:59,055
乐队发生这样的事实在是太遗憾了
It's a shame what happened to the band.

296
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,082
你已经多久没碰吉他了?
How long since you played?

297
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:03,026
我的吉他
My guitar...

298
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:08,029
差不多有8天11个小时了
8 days, 11 hours, give or take.

299
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:09,053
你想它了?
You miss it?

300
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:14,097
这儿还有很多残留物 或许可以找到一把
Well, a lot of wreckage. It might still turn up.

301
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:18,023
没损坏?  还可以弹奏?不可能找的到的
Undamaged? Still playable? I don't think so.

302
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:22,046
我当然希望找到它但登机前核对我的那家伙是个混蛋
I mean, I wish, but there was this bloke at the counter made me check it in.

303
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:25,091
她说客舱里没足够空间了就像个法西斯一样
wasn't enough roomin the cabin. Fascist.

304
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:29,049
你会再见到你的吉他的
You will see it again.

305
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,030
是吗?
yeah?

306
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:33,018
为什么这么说?
What makes you say that?

307
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:35,013
因为我有信仰  Charlie
Because I have faith, Charlie.

308
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,019
总算来了
It's about time.

309
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,081
我都快渴死了
I am dying of thirst.

310
00:24:56,086 --> 00:24:59,030
我想我得让他在太阳底下多呆会儿
I think I'll let him sit in the sun a while longer.

311
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:01,064
然后我会把他妻子拉到一边
Then I'll take his wife aside

312
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:04,034
设法和她沟通
find some way to communicate.

313
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:07,015
我想她知道为什么他要攻击Michael
I think she knows why he attacked Michael.

314
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,093
真不用着我去和她谈?
You sure you don't want me to talk to her?

315
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:11,049
好吧
Okay.

316
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:12,061
你把那件事解决了
If you've got that under control

317
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:14,069
我就和人们谈关于山洞的事
I'm gonna start talking to people about the caves.

318
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:17,075
可能的话夜幕降临前就带些人过去
Might be able to get a few to go with me before nightfall

319
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,088
在那扎营
start setting up camp.

320
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:23,001
你是认真的?
You're serious?

321
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:32,013
你要开辟自己的文明时代却不和我们商量一下?
Is there a reason you didn't consult us when you decided to form your own civilization?

322
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:35,087
我只是说搬到山谷那儿去
I'm only talking about moving into the valley.

323
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:37,086
你上次还说大家要呆在一起  独自死去?
Well, what happened to live together, die alone?

324
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:40,034
大家一块儿把工作做好是唯一的生存之道
Digging in together is the only way we're gonna survive.

325
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,090
我们要活下去  最幸运的就是被飞机或船只发现我们困在这里
Our best hope of survival is in being spotted by a plane or a ship.

326
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:47,018
而如果要让别人发现的话  我们得组织大家不停的用火焰发射信号
And for that, we need to organize everyone to keep that signal fire burning

327
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:49,012
而另外一些人得在岛上找食物
while others scout the island for supplies.

328
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:51,085
在其它地方扎营  那是一种自杀
Digging in anywhere else is suicide.

329
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,099
那是我们找到的唯一的淡水源地  Sayid
It is the only source of freshwater we've found, Sayid.

330
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:57,069
呆在海边  太阳底下没有水喝...
And staying on the beach, in the sun, without water...

331
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,017
难道那就不是自杀?
that's not suicide?

332
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,038
我还没有放弃希望
I'm not going to admit defeat.

333
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,048
又怎么了?
Now what?

334
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:36,058
事情我已经说得很清楚了  老大
I already gave you my statement, sheriff.

335
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:39,094
我是来道歉的 我不应该这么疑神疑鬼
I came to apologize. I shouldn't have been suspicious.

336
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:42,001
今天早上  你才是受害者
You were the victim in the attack this morning.

337
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:43,057
很感谢你这么说
I appreciate that

338
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:47,076
不过我敢说你专程跑来不会是来跟我道歉的
but I can tell you didn't come all the way over here just to say you're sorry.

339
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,084
人们都在考虑跟随Jack去山洞住
People are seriously considering following Jack to the caves.

340
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,086
我想知道你是怎么想的
I'd like to know where you stand.

341
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:56,029
我要呆在这儿
Right here.

342
00:26:56,088 --> 00:27:00,044
现在最重要的事是尽快让我的孩子离开这个岛
I got one priority right now, and that's getting my kid off this island.

343
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,010
要是有船只经过我就不想错过这样的机会
A boat passes, I'm not gonna be on the hook for missing it.

344
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:12,034
慢慢喝  每次少喝一点省着点喝
Slowly. Just a little bit at a time. Little bit.

345
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:16,078
很高兴你也一块来
Glad you're coming.

346
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:20,067
伙计  野猪在哪  我就去哪
man, I go where the boar's at.

347
00:27:21,092 --> 00:27:22,093
那么...
So...

348
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:25,032
你和Kate有什么进展?
what up with you and Kate?

349
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,060
你俩会去山洞里同居  还是怎样?
You guys gonna move into a cave together, or what?

350
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:30,069
-什么  我还像高中生那样?  -就是说你不否认了?
-Sorry, am I in high school?  -Well, that wasn't a denial.

351
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:33,044
快点整理  我们马上就出发
Just get your stuff together. We got to get out of here soon.

352
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:37,064
这不是我们的舞会美女么
If it ain't the belle of the ball.

353
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,089
医生和军官为你而战感觉怎么样?
So what's it like, having both the doctor and captain falafel fighting over you?

354
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:48,093
我是这么看他们的雀斑女
Just call'em how I see 'em, freckles.

355
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:51,046
实话说
Truth be told

356
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:54,051
我和别人一样都很好奇你是怎么看待
I'm not the only one wondering where you're gonnan weigh in on this whole

357
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:56,021
搬离海滩这样的事
moving off the beach thing.

358
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:58,068
你要和那个悲观的家伙一块去?
Are you going with the pessimists

359
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,095
还是呆在这儿  等着救援的到来?
or staying here and waiting for the rescue boats?

360
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,009
你会去吗?
Are you going?

361
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:04,019
这真是个小把戏  不是吗?
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

362
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:06,056
如果我们都把赌注压在去山洞
We all pack up stakes for the caves

363
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,059
第2天  一架飞机高兴地飞过小岛
next day a plane passes by

364
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:11,076
那样的话  大家都会傻愣眼
they're gonna go on their merry way and be none the wiser.

365
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,056
相反  如果呆在这儿 被野猪吃掉  或被山石砸死
On the other hand, stay here, get eaten by boars, fall off a rock

366
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:20,080
至少还可能碰到来救援的
not gonna be anyone around to answer that 911 call.

367
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,054
你还没有回答我的问题
You still haven't answered my question.

368
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:25,004
你也没回答我的
You didn't answer mine.

369
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:27,064
而且是我先问的
And I asked first.

370
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:16,064
你丈夫不反对出钱重新装修这儿

371
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:18,064
你真是个幸运的妻子

372
00:29:18,084 --> 00:29:19,064
是啊

373
00:29:20,064 --> 00:29:21,064
把狗拿开

374
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:28,064
让我们去看看卧室吧  好吗?

375
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:33,004
你确定要这样做吗?

376
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:35,044
确定

377
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:37,055
你上过课了?

378
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:38,055
上过了

379
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:47,035
你知道你父亲和你丈夫会不顾一切地找你吗?

380
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:55,005
你确定你跟你丈夫和解不了了吗?

381
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:01,005
我走了以后你能帮我照顾我的狗吗?

382
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:15,005
在机场里  11点15分

383
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,010
找个借口出机场

384
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,010
什么也别带

385
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,010
有辆车会等你的

386
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,010
接下来的一个礼拜你的家人会认为你被绑架了

387
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:38,060
你要继续躲着直到他们认为你已经死了

388
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,060
从那以后你就可以自由地去任何地方了

389
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,010
那么  再跟我复述一下时间吧

390
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:56,010
机场  11点15分

391
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,010
再说一次

392
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,010
 11点15分

393
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:25,081
太好了  看谁来了
great. Look who came to chat.

394
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:31,096
我得和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

395
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:44,055
你会说英语?
You speak english?

396
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,071
什么  你会说英语?
What...you speak english?

397
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:52,093
为什么你以前不说?
Why didn't you say anything?

398
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:55,000
我丈夫不知道我会说英语
My husband doesn't know.

399
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:57,021
你会英语为什么不能告诉你丈夫?
Why would you learn english and not tell your husband?

400
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:58,088
他脾气很坏
He has a bad temper.

401
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,093
今天我丈夫这么做
What my husband did to you today...

402
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:04,063
其实是一个误解
it was a misunderstanding.

403
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:06,068
我可明白他这样做的原因 清清楚楚  明明白白
No, I got it. Loud and clear.

404
00:32:06,076 --> 00:32:08,013
是因为手表的原因
It was the watch.

405
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:11,066
你丈夫为了一只表居然要谋杀我?
Your husband tried to murder me for a watch?

406
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,020
这表是我在两天前找到的
I found this watch two days ago.

407
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,079
这是我父亲的表
It belongs to my father.

408
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:19,052
保护那只手表是一个尊严问题
Protecting that watch is a question of honor.

409
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,060
你认为在我孩子面前杀我是很尊严的行为?
You call trying to kill me in front of my kid honor?

410
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:23,022
你不了解我的父亲
You don't know my father.

411
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:27,014
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

412
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:41,077
听我说  你这老怪物
Listen to me, you old geek.

413
00:32:41,098 --> 00:32:43,043
我要去丛林
I'm going in the jungle.

414
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:45,042
一个男人...
A man has...

415
00:32:45,091 --> 00:32:47,074
有权保护自己的隐私
a right to some privacy.

416
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:49,017
只要把它给我就行
Just hand it to me.

417
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:53,009
你会被耗尽的
You're gonna run out.

418
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,033
与其说以后  不如说很快
My guess is sooner rather than later.

419
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:58,053
痛苦地戒毒过程是在所难免的
Painful detox is inevitable.

420
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:02,001
但如果现在就开始戒毒至少这是你自己的选择
Give it up now. At least it'll be your choice.

421
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,081
不要这样跟我说话好象你什么都知道似的
Don't talk to me like you know something about me.

422
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:09,004
我受过的苦  你难以想象
I know a lot more about pain than you think.

423
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,042
我并不嫉妒你现在所面对的
I don't envy what you're facing

424
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:14,015
但是我想帮助你
but I want to help

425
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,072
你想要你的吉他吗?
Do you want your guitar?

426
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,047
甚于毒品?
More than your drug?

427
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:35,045
你想象不到我有多么想要
More than you know.

428
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:39,060
就我所知  如果你在寻找什么这座岛屿就会给你什么
What I know is that this island just might give you what you're looking for

429
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:41,066
但前提是你也得给这座岛一些东西
but you have to give the island something.

430
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:03,094
你真的能找到我的吉他?
You really think you can find my guitar?

431
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:08,061
往上看  Charlie
Look up, Charlie.

432
00:34:08,082 --> 00:34:10,077
你不会要我祈祷吧
You're not gonna ask me to pray or something.

433
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,019
我要你往上看
I want you to look up.

434
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:35,009
该出发了
It's almost time to go.

435
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:40,030
我不想成为夏娃
I don't want to be Eve.

436
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:45,037
没人要你成为夏娃
No one's asking you to.

437
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:47,031
我只是不能...
I just can't...

438
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:55,005
有人得留这儿站岗等着救援的到来
Someone else can stay here, keep a look out, wait for rescue.

439
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,050
为什么一定要是你?
Why does it have to be you?

440
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:58,091
-不是这个原因  -那是什么原因?
-That's not it.  -Then what is it?

441
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:08,092
Kate  为什么你要这样?
Kate, how did you get to be this way?

442
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:12,073
你这么做有什么原因吗?
Just what is it that you did?

443
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:14,075
你会明白的
You had your chance to know.

444
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:28,074
如果需要我的话你知道在哪可以找到我
If you need me, you know where to find me.

445
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,014
你也知道去哪儿找我
You know where to find me, too.

446
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,049
我知道你听不懂
I know you can't understand a word

447
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:48,050
一般说来我也不是那种"大嗓门"的人
and normally I'm not the talking-out-loud type

448
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:50,024
但既然你在听
but since I have a captive audience

449
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,028
为了你自己  你好好给我听着
I hope for your sake you pay attention.

450
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,095
这个月我过得并不好
I'm not exactly having the best month of my life.

451
00:35:56,002 --> 00:35:59,013
我几乎不了解我的儿子而现在我得做他的爸爸
I barely know my son, and now I gotta be his daddy.

452
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:00,066
撇开那不说
And then to top it off

453
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:04,030
居然有个神经错乱的韩国佬想杀我  为什么呢?!
I have a deranged korean guy trying to kill me, and for what?!

454
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,096
我现在算是明白了
I get it. Right

455
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:12,020
是为了只只手表我自己的坏了 我在残骸里找到的
It's the watch. Mine broke. I found this in the wreckage,

456
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:16,064
我就想怎么能让一块价值2万美圆的手表变成垃圾?
and I figured, hey, why let a $20,000 watch go to waste?

457
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:20,052
不过实在是太可笑了在这该死的岛上知道时间有什么用啊!
Which is ridiculous, since time doesn't matter on a damn island!

458
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:24,016
该死的....
Son of a...

459
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:31,096
离我远点...
Stay away from me...

460
00:36:32,078 --> 00:36:34,028
还有我的儿子
and my kid.

461
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:51,040
我必须在16小时内赶到L.A.X.
16 hours, I need to land at L.A.X.

462
00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:53,040
而且我必须得让灵柩通过海关
And I need that coffin to clear customs

463
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:57,054
因为那儿将会有灵车等着而且那灵车...
because there's gonna be a hearse waiting, and I need that hearse...

464
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:51,054
出事了吗?

465
00:38:53,054 --> 00:38:55,054
花真是太漂亮了

466
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:32,053
有人吗!
Hello!

467
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,003
怎么回事?
What's this?

468
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,027
新居民
New tenants.

469
00:39:48,038 --> 00:39:51,003
很近?!  骗人!!
Short walk. They lied.

470
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,087
我能问你件事吗?
Could I ask you something?

471
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:47,029
随便问  儿子
Anything you want, man.

472
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:50,065
你什么时候生日?
When's your birthday?

473
00:41:43,060 --> 00:42:00,060
