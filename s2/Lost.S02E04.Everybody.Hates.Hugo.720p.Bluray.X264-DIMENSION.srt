2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,085
带上竹筏去的

3
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:06,014
等他们获救时  
For when they get rescued.

4
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:07,036
他们就可以跟你家人联系了

5
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:18,066
Michael  Jin

00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:39,076

00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:59,085
伙计  你会说英语
Dude, you speak English.

17
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:03,085

00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:15,085

一切都会改变的
Everything's going to change.

21
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,085
什么?

22
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:25,096
一切都会改变的
Everything's going to change.

23
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:31,085
来点咯咯鸡快餐吧  Hugo

24
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:34,096
Hurley

00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:37,095
你睡着了?
You fell asleep?

26
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:40,085
不  我只是...
No. I was just...

27
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:44,015
休息一下眼睛
resting my eyes.

28
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,055
那些数字写在这儿
The numbers are written right there.

29
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:50,085
好  我记得那些数字
Yeah. I remember the numbers.

30
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:51,080
Lock回去海滩那儿了  
Locke went back to the beach,

31
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,039
下一个我来 
so I'll be taking the next shift.

32
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:56,086
太好了
Awesome.

33
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:59,085
Jack告诉我你工作的事了
Jack told me about your job.

34
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:03,056
至少现在咱们又有工作了  是吧
At least we have jobs again, right?

35
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:07,056
太棒了
Hooray for us.

36
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:19,056
生活真不错呀 
Well, ain't life grand?

37
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:26,056
现在要是有杯水就更好了
What I wouldn't give for a cup of water right now...

38
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,085
好了  别再叠罗汉了
No way. No more human pyramids.

39
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:39,006
省省吧
Just forget it.

40
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,085
让我们出去
Hey! Let us out of here!

41
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:47,085
-够了  冷静点
-Enough! Just chill!

42
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:50,085
我在这里的每一分钟
Every minute I spend down here

43
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:53,085
就是我儿子在危险之中的一分钟
is another minute my boy is still out there.

44
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:56,085
让我说给你听  Mikey
let me break it down for ya, Mikey.

45
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:58,031
现在Rambina他们一伙人
Right now,Rambina and her buddies

46
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:00,027
正在琢磨怎么对付我们 
are trying to figure out what to do with us,

47
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,032
在他们决定之前 
so until they make up their damn mind,

48
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:04,093
我们什么也做不了 
there ain't nothing we can do.

49
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:16,056
对啊
Yeah.

50
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:21,056
要不你撒点尿在上面
Why don't you pee on it?

51
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:32,056
抓住绳子
Grab the rope.

52
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:36,086
拜托
Please.

53
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:45,086
别听他的
Don't do it.

54
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:54,086
沿绳子爬上来  不然我就朝你朋友开枪
Climb the rope, or I shoot your friend.

55
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:13,085
下一个是你
You next.

56
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:14,085
别上去
Don't do it.

57
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:17,076
她在骗我们
She's bluffing.

58
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:22,055
枪里只有一发子弹  她不会浪费在我们身上的
Gun's only got one bullet, she ain't gonna waste it on...

59
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,085
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

60
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:24,085
妈的
God!

61
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:27,076
抓住绳子
Grab the rope.

62
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:43,085
下个是我吗  辣妹
You want me, Hot Lips?

63
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:47,076
这得要你下来...
You're gonna have to come down here and get...

64
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:48,099
婊子
Bitch.

65
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:10,025
4,8,15,16,23

66
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:12,035
特别号码  42
with the Mega Number 42.

67
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:14,025
如果有人买了这组数字就中了头彩
Whoever has those numbers has won

68
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:17,092
否则奖金将累计至下一期
or will share in a near-record jackpot.

69
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,062
是啊  Mary Jo
That's right, Mary Jo,

70
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:23,065
已经连续有16期没有产生大奖了
because this is the 16th week without a winner.

71
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,052
Hugo

72
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:29,059
Hugo  Hugo

73
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,069
Hugo  醒醒
Hugo, wake up!

74
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,099
醒醒
Wake up!

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,099
好了  妈妈  好了  我只是滑倒了
Stop! Ma, stop! I just slipped.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,002
坐着都会滑倒  是心脏不好么
Slipped, sitting down? Is it your heart?

77
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:40,032
妈妈  我没事
Ma, I'm fine.

78
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,062
你在骗我
You're lying.

79
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:44,025
我知道  因为你眼睛没有看着我
I always know.You don't look me in the eyes.

80
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:45,062
我没骗你
I'm not lying.

81
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:50,062
那就告诉我发生了什么事 
Then tell me what happened.

82
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,072
一定是我吃东西吃坏了
It must have been something I ate.

83
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:58,065
是的  一定是你吃坏了
Yes, something you ate,

84
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:01,019
因为你吃这么多东西却从不运动
because you eat basura, and you don't exercise.

85
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,069
我做运动 
I do exercise.

86
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,035
滑倒不叫运动 
Falling down is not exercise.

87
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:05,007
你唯一做的运动 
The only time you move

88
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,068
就是拿着食物往口里塞 
is to lift a drumstick from the bucket.

89
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,042
每天都一样  Hugo
Every day it's the same thing. Hugo.

90
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:13,059
工作  看电视  然后吃鸡肉
Work, TV, chicken.

91
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,085
你得改变一下你的生活了  Hugo
You have to change your life, Hugo.

92
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:18,079
你认为别人会帮你改变吗
You think someone else will change it for you?

93
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,029
如果你每天都在祈祷还有可能
Maybe if you pray every day

94
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,085
耶稣会从天堂下来
Jesus Christ will come down,

95
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:24,015
帮你减掉200磅然后带给你一个不错的女人
take 200 pounds and bring you a decent woman.

96
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:26,002
还有一辆新车
And a new car.

97
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:28,009
是的  耶稣会给你一辆新车的
Yes, Jesus can bring you a new car.

98
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,069
也许我不想改变  也许我喜欢我的生活
Maybe I don't wanna change. Maybe I like my life.

99
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,053
一定是耶稣打来的
That must be Jesus.

100
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,069
是的  是耶稣打来的
Yes, it is Jesus!

101
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,070
他想知道你要什么颜色的车
He wants to know what color car you want!

102
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:59,022
Hurley  打扰一下
Hurley! All right, mate?

103
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,012
我们得聊一下
We need to have a little chat.

104
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,012
别担心  他妈妈散步去了
Don't worry! Mummy's off for a walk,

105
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,012
所以现在只有你我和这个孩子
so it's just you, me, and the baby.

106
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,042
说一下吧
Spill it.

107
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:09,032
说什么
Spill what?

108
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,069
那个舱子
The hatch.

109
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,085
里面有什么
What's in it?

110
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:15,022
什么也没有  真的
Nothing, really.

111
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:18,045
你在那儿整整一天一夜了
You've been out there an entire day and night.

112
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:20,045
什么都没看到
Looking at nothing?

113
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,095
我想它就像...
Well, I guess...

114
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:24,095
一个掩体
it's kind of like a bunker.

115
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:27,085
你知道  是二战时的
You know, from World War Two?

116
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:29,039
可能还要晚一点
Only newer.

117
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,055
里面有什么?
And what's in it?

118
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:33,032
我不知道
I don't know.

119
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:36,062
但是无论如何你知道那是一个掩体
But somehow you know it's a bunker.

120
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:41,022
我想是别人告诉我的
Well, I guess someone told me?

121
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:45,032
你要骗我?
You're gonna lie to me?

122
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,005
你要骗这孩子?
You're gonna lie to the baby?

123
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:49,055
伙计  听着  我从不说谎
Dude, look, I'd never lie.

124
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:52,032
那你上次还跟我说你有1亿5千万的家产
And the time you told me you were worth $150 million?

125
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,052
是1亿5千6百万
It's 156 million.

126
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:56,042
抱歉  我可能为我900万亿的家产
I'm sorry! I must've confused it

127
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:59,079
感到困惑了
with the 900 trillion I am worth myself!

128
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,099
这孩子是巧克力棒棒糖做的
And this baby's made of chocolate lollipops,

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,099
还有如果你不介意的话
so excuse us,

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,056
我会拍拍翅膀飞离这个岛
I'm going to flap my wings and fly off this island.

131
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:32,005
嘿  Rose
Hey, Rose.

132
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:35,025
你好
Hey, yourself.

133
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,082
那个  在洗衣服啊
So, doing laundry, huh?

134
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,049
是啊
Indeed I am.

135
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,060
帮我把那些脏衣服递过来吧
You wanna hand me those dirty clothes over there?

136
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,065
谢谢
Thank you.

137
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:51,099
你不想知道发生了什么吗
Don't you wanna know what happened?

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,092
发生什么了
What happened?

139
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,042
你知道  就在那里
You know... out there.

140
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:57,015
每个人都问我舱子里有什么
Everyone's asking me what's in the hatch.

141
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:59,082
那是你自己的事  亲爱的
Well, that's your business, honey.

142
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,085
你不想知道
Don't you wanna know?

143
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:05,019
不管是什么  它都不会
Well, whatever it is, it's not going to help

144
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,060
帮我洗衣服的  是吧
get this laundry done now, is it?

145
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:13,095
事实上
Well, actually,

146
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:17,080
可能会的
it sort of is.

147
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:26,073
就在这附近
It's around here somewhere...

148
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:03,089
真的有人住在这下面吗
Someone actually lived down here

149
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:11,042
这是用来干什么的
Well, what is it for?

150
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:13,042
这...
It's...

151
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:17,020
这说来话长
t's kind of a long story.

152
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,045
Hurley...

153
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,045
你还告诉谁了
Who else did you tell?

154
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,092
没了
No one.

155
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,019
我发誓
I swear.

156
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,025
伙计  这工作量太大
Dude, it's a big job.

157
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,065
我需要...
I needed...

158
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,069
帮助
help.

159
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,002
你好  Jack  -你好  Rose
-Hello, Jack. -Hey, Rose.

160
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:36,042
她很好  她不会和别人说的
She's cool. She won't tell anyone.

161
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:41,033
亲爱的  我连我要说什么都不知道了
Honey, I don't even know what I would say.

162
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,075
这全是吃的吗
All this is food?

163
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:39,085
这只是个时间问题
It's only a matter of time before

164
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:42,079
他们迟早会知道我们在这儿找到什么的
we have to tell everyone what we found.

165
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,099
那么  你知道该怎么做了
So, you know what to do?

166
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,049
清点一下所有食物
Inventory all of it,

167
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,095
算一下能维持多久
and figure out how we make it last.

168
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:51,092
这期间不许有人拿东西吃
And in the meantime, nobody gets anything.

169
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:53,012
没人可以例外
No exceptions.

170
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:57,019
你就负责这个Hurley  行吗
That's your responsibility,Hurley. OK?

171
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,063
-什么声音  -你不会想要知道的
-What's that? -You don't wanna know.

172
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:03,065
达摩启动计划色拉调料
"Dharma Initiative salad dressing:

173
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,002
农场合成风味
Ranch composite. "

174
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:09,080
听起来很美味
That sounds tasty.

175
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:19,002
"阿波罗条"你听说过吗
"Apollo Bars?" You ever hear of these?

176
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:22,062
但是糖就是糖  Bernard经常这么说的
But candy is candy. That's what Bernard always says.

177
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:25,089
说到吃甜品
Talk about a sweet tooth.

178
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,039
那家伙真的很爱吃甜的东西
That man has a mouth full of sweet teeth.

179
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,062
Bernard  是你的丈夫
Bernard. That was your husband?

180
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:33,085
是我的丈夫
"Is" my husband.

181
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,029
但是...
But...

182
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,062
我还以为他当时是在飞机的后舱
I thought he was in the back of the plane?

183
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:42,052
抱歉  我不是说...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

184
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,052
不  没关系  没事的
No, that's OK, don't feel bad.

185
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,042
Bernard肯定还活着  我知道的
Bernard is fine. I know it.

186
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:51,020
你想拿走这罐金枪鱼么
You wanna get the canned tuna?

187
00:13:56,053 --> 00:14:00,005
每个人都会恨我的  Rose
Everyone's gonna hate me, Rose.

188
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,019
别傻了
Now, that's just plain silly.

189
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,092
你可能是唯一一个
You're about the only one on this island

190
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,099
岛上的人全都喜欢的人了
that everybody loves.

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,052
那是会改变的
Well, that'll change.

192
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:12,052
你们在这儿有看到过香波没
You happen to find any shampoo in here?

193
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:16,092
是的  那儿有几瓶
Yeah, there's some right over here.

194
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:20,065
Kate  你不能拿...
Kate, you can't take it...

195
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:24,000
谢谢  Hurley
Thanks, Hurley.

196
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,065
只是一瓶罢了
It's just one bottle.

197
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:30,066
有人拿了大家都会来拿的
That's where it starts.

198
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:38,026
欢迎来到咯咯鸡快餐店  你想要点什么
Welcome to Mr Cluck's, can I take your order?

199
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:44,090
嘿  Hugo
Hey, Hugo.

200
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,062
你还好吧  伙计
You OK, man?

201
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:48,039
很好
Yeah.

202
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,025
没事
Fine.

203
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:55,080
Reyes  马上来我办公室
Reyes! My office! Now!

204
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:03,073
有什么要说的么  Reyes
You wanna tell me something, Reyes?

205
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,035
没有
No.

206
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:11,053
你确定
You sure about that?

207
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,039
是的
Yeah.

208
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,030
这是昨晚的监控录像
This is last night's surveillance tape.

209
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,064
Reyes  你欠公司
Reyes, you owe the company

210
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:31,004
8块黑肉三明治 
for an eight-piece dark-meat combo.

211
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:33,049
-我没吃8块这么多  -你想把录像都看一遍吗
-I didn't eat eight.  -You want to watch the whole tape?

212
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,015
你在这儿的时候
Oh, and while you're here:

213
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:38,065
我和你说了几次了
How many times do I gotta tell you

214
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,062
那些餐巾纸是要钱的  好吗
those napkins cost money, all right?

215
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:42,065
每个客人只能给两张  就两张  我们不是
It's two per customer. Two. We're not

216
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,065
我们咯咯鸡快餐店是不印钱的  Reyes
We're not made of money here at Mr Cluck's, Reyes.

217
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:48,049
我不是家财万贯  你是吗
I'm not made of money. Are you made of money?

218
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,019
因为如果你家财万贯
If you're made of money,

219
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,065
可能你就不会在这儿工作了  所以好好想想
maybe you don't want to work here. So,get it together.

220
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:57,046
怎么了  有问题吗  Reyes
What, is that a problem, Reyes?

221
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:09,076
伙计  我不干了
Dude, I quit.

222
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,035
哦  天那
Oh, my God.

223
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:16,009
-哦  天那  -伙计
-Oh, my God.  -Dude?

224
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,042
你没事吧?
Are you OK?

225
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,065
我... 我很好
I... I'm fine.

226
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,045
Randy情绪很失控
Randy is losing his brain in there!

227
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,092
你最好回去
You should get back in

228
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:25,049
否则他会让你在这周剩余的时间里都去打扫厕所
or he'll make you scrub johns all week.

229
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,055
-不可能了  我也不干了  -什么 
-Doubt it. I quit too. -What?

230
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:31,072
看来我们都可以休假一天了
Looks like we got ourselves a day off.

231
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:36,063
我都长这么帅了还要钱干吗
Who needs money when you got good looks?

232
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:06,005
你现在可以出来了
You can come out now.

233
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:08,032
我在岩石那儿看到你了
I saw you back at the rock.

234
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:11,015
在红树那儿也是
Then at the mangrove tree.

235
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:13,082
事实上  我绕了一个大圈
In fact, I've walked in a big circle.

236
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:18,083
我不明白你怎么都没看出来
I'm not sure how you didn't realise it.

237
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,029
好吧
All right,

238
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,030
你不需要讽刺我
you don't have to insult me.

239
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:33,055
想告诉我为什么跟着我吗  Charlie
Want to tell me why you've been following me, Charlie?

240
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:35,099
好吧
Yeah.

241
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,015
原因很简单  John
Quite simply, John,

242
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,065
这地方有太多的秘密
there are a lot of secrets around here.

243
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:43,029
我也厌烦了只是看护着那孩子
And I'm tired of being at the kids' table.

244
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,092
我把Claire的孩子带回来了
I got Claire's baby back!

245
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:47,092
但却没有和你们一起行动
I didn't go to the Black Rock

246
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:49,029
去黑岩石那儿
on the A-Team mission,

247
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,042
但是如果有人要我去我肯定会去的
but I would have, if someone had asked me.

248
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:57,063
我想我有资格知道这里的一些事情 
I think I'm entitled to some sodding answers around here.

249
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,070
你想知道什么
What do you want to know?

250
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,069
进展怎么样了
How's it going?

251
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,029
还不行
It's not.

252
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,005
这门的另一边有更多的混凝土
On the other side of this door, there's more concrete.

253
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:18,025
我想至少有8到10英尺厚
I'd say it's at least eight-to-ten-feet thick.

254
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:22,026
你看见了吗
Did you see this?

255
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,015
有意思
Interesting.

256
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:28,035
还好这是钛合金
Good thing this is titanium.

257
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,062
基本上没什么磁性
Almost no magnetic attraction.

258
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:33,072
但是我们不能从上面过去
we're not going to get in up here.

259
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:37,070
从上面
Up here

260
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:45,060
也许我们可以从下面走
Perhaps we can go under it.

261
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,082
抓住绳子
Grab the rope.

262
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:05,049
在我知道我的朋友们没事前我什么也不会做
I ain't doing nothing until I know my friends are OK.

263
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:09,020
那我们现在是朋友了吧
So we're friends now, huh?

264
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:15,026
快上来  不然我把绳子拉上来了
Do it now or the rope comes up.

265
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:24,039
你们好啊  朋友们
Howdy, boys,

266
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,079
-谢谢你们救我  -没事了
-thanks for the rescue.  -Everything is cool,

267
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,065
我们谈过了  
we had a talk,

268
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:29,037
他们相信了我们也是在飞机上的 
and they believe we were on the plane, too.

269
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,065
又多了一批幸存者
Swell.

270
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:35,056
我猜我们可以一起去告大洋航空公司了
I guess we can all sue Oceanic together.

271
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:37,062
你手上的是什么?
What you got there?

272
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:39,099
没什么
Nothing.

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,015
是石头么  你想报复我
You got a rock? Looking for some revenge?

274
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:47,013
-给你3秒钟时间丢了它  -Ana
-You got three seconds to drop it.  -Ana.

275
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,042
等下...喔
Now, hold on...

276
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:54,020
嘿  怎么...
Hey, what's...

277
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:57,072
你还没说3
You didn't say "three".

278
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:58,092
闭嘴
Shut up.

279
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:01,005
我叫你做什么就做什么
When I tell you to do something, you do it.

280
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:04,035
我叫你走你就走  我叫你停你就停
I say move, you move. I say stop, you stop.

281
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,042
-我说跳  你怎么做  -你先跳
-I say jump, what do you say?  -"You first. "

282
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:09,032
你如果不按我说的做
You don't like the rules,

283
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:12,039
我现在就把你一屁股踢回那个坑里
I toss your ass back in the pit right now.

284
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,092
知道了么
You understand?

285
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:17,020
知道了
I understand.

286
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,085
天色开始暗了
It's getting dark.

287
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:28,005
我们得出发了
We're moving out.

288
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:29,089
出发去哪儿
Moving out where?

289
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,029
我刚说了什么
What did I just tell you?

290
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,059
抱歉  我忘了
Sorry. Forgot.

291
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,045
不过还有一件事
Just one thing, though.

292
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:39,022
你再打我一下
You hit me again,

293
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:43,030
我会杀了你
I'll kill you.

294
00:20:44,003 --> 00:20:47,086
我们出发
Let's go.

295
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,025
他每隔108分钟就要按那个键
He pushed that button every 108 minutes?

296
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:21,055
是的
He did indeed.

297
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:24,022
但是这怎么可能  我是说  他不用睡觉
How is that possible? I mean,didn't he sleep?

298
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:26,045
不知道  没机会问他
Don't know. I didn't get a chance to ask him.

299
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:28,065
那之后  他上来然后离开了
After all that time, he just up and left?

300
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:30,092
我是说为什么  他会去哪
I mean why? Where'd he go?

301
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:32,032
不知道
Don't know.

302
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:35,045
我试图跟踪他  但是他并没有留下太多的痕迹
I tried to track him, but he didn't leave much of a trail.

303
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:37,089
我想他认为他已经找到了他的替代者
I guess he'd found his replacements.

304
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,020
-是指我们  -是我们
-Meaning us?  -Meaning us.

305
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,055
这听起来有点疯狂
It sounds a bit... nutty,

306
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:47,042
不是么
doesn't it?

307
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:49,075
但事实就是那样的  Charlie
It is what it is, Charlie.

308
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:52,045
如果我们不按那颗键会发生什么
And what happens if we don't push it?

309
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:55,062
我们不会去找答案的  我正在建立一个制度
We're not going to find out. I'm setting up a system.

310
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,079
具体还没弄好  大概框架是
I'm still working on it, but looks like

311
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,059
-我们要每2个人一班值6个小时的岗  -轮换
-two-person shifts every six hours or so.  -Shifts.

312
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,002
按按键
Pushing a button?

313
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:10,010
那儿还有只电唱机
Oh, and there's a record player.

314
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,012
Hurley在那儿干什么
What's Hurley been doing there?

315
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:17,035
他主管食物
He's in charge of the food.

316
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:21,010
食物
Food?

317
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:36,032
嘿  伙计
Hey, mate.

318
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,052
你去哪儿了
Where have you been?

319
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:41,019
嘿  我...在附近转了转
Hey. I've been... around.

320
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,089
我知道了  Hurley
I know, Hurley.

321
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,049
知道什么
You know what?

322
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,085
我知道关于食物的事了  Locke把一切都告诉我了
I know about the food. Locke told me everything.

323
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:50,005
-知道吗Locke在骗你  -我知道
-You kown Locke's lying.  -I am.

324
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:52,065
他骗我说我们得每隔108分钟按一下按键
Did you lie about the button we have to push every 108 minutes

325
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,065
不然这个岛就会爆炸
or the island explodes?

326
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:56,072
不会爆炸的
It's not gonna explode.

327
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:59,002
-拜托  -听着  是Jack让我来管理的
-Come on. -Look, Jack put me in charge.

328
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,065
-我其实并不想...  -那有花生酱吗
-I don't even want to...  -Is there peanut butter?

329
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:02,082
什么
What?

330
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,002
花生酱
Peanut butter.

331
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:06,042
果仁的  奶油的  能够吸引孩子的那种
Nutty? Creamy? Staple of children everywhere?

332
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:09,042
是的  有一些
Yeah, a couple jars.

333
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:14,019
好极了  给我们一罐怎么样
Brilliant. How about you give us one?

334
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,072
是给Claire的
It's for Claire.

335
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:18,032
不行  伙计
No can do, man.

336
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:21,032
你对一个正在抚养婴儿的母亲说不
You're saying no to a nursing mother?

337
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,052
-不是这样的  -就是这样的
-It's not like that.  -It's exactly like that.

338
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,022
你看  我从没想过会这样  但是事实就是如此
You kown, I never thought this would happen, but it did.

339
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:29,002
-你变成了他们的一员  -他们的一员
-You've become one of them.  -One of them?

340
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:31,085
他们  那些人  那些领导
Them. The man. Management.

341
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:33,085
我还以为我们是朋友
I thought we were friends.

342
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:38,013
你变了  伙计
You've changed, man.

343
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,085
主动轴乐队... 不比糟糕乐队好多少
Drive Shaft... More like Suck Shaft.

344
00:23:56,086 --> 00:24:01,042
我去看看那些耳机
I'm gonna go to check out the headphones.

345
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:05,019
好的  耳机
Sure. Headphones.

346
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,069
Hugo  -Starla

347
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,076
你们这两个笨蛋怎么没上班  
Why aren't you chuckleheads at work?

348
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:11,007
我们正在找其他的工作
We're currently exploring other opportunities.

349
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,042
你辞职了
You quit?

350
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,099
是的
I did.

351
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,009
他今天和老板吵架了  他出轨了
He's mixing it up today. He's off the rails.

352
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,035
谁能看紧他 
Somebody get a straightjacket!

353
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,048
我能试试那些吗
Hey, can I try those on?

354
00:24:19,073 --> 00:24:22,002
你正在颠覆我的世界观  Hugo
You're messing with my world-view.

355
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,039
你让我震惊
You're my rock.

356
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,039
我是说  你辞职了就像
I mean, if you quit your job,

357
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,012
蜜蜂不采蜜了一样
the next thing you know, bees will stop making honey,

358
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:30,072
花儿会死的
and flowers will die,

359
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:33,035
而且  这音响也会掉下去摔成两半
and, hell, the whole damn thing will fall apart.

360
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:36,095
那么  Starla...
So, Starla...

361
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:41,059
抱歉
Sorry.

362
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:46,095
海德剧院这个周末有民谣歌手表演
The Hold Steady's playing the Troubadour this weekend.

363
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:49,045
我在想周五是否...
And I was wondering, maybe Friday...

364
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:52,035
我得上班
Oh, I have to work.

365
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:54,015
不  我不是说...
Oh, no, I didn't mean...

366
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,070
星期六我可以去  可以么
I can probably go Saturday. That cool?

367
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:03,065
好  太好了
Yeah. That's totally cool.

368
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,082
伙计  你准备追这女孩都已经一个月了
Dude, you've been crushing on her for months.

369
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,015
而你却什么都没做
and doing nothing.

370
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:08,092
今天你做到了
Today, you're fricking Fabio!

371
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:11,052
认真的说  伙计  你到底在想什么
Seriously, man, what has gotten into you?

372
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:14,012
没什么  我只是在那个以前想约她出去...
Nothing. I just wanted to ask her out before...

373
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,085
在什么以前
Before what?

374
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:17,089
没什么
Nothing.

375
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,075
这是最后一段管道
This is the last duct.

376
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:23,025
我想我们正在开始的那堵墙的下面
I believe we're under the area where we began.

377
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:28,080
他们连这里都浇灌了混凝土
They've poured concrete all the way down here, too.

378
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,072
也很厚
Just as thick.

379
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:40,016
也许附近还有路
Maybe there's a way around it.

380
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:45,085
这些东西都是用来干什么的
What is all this stuff?

381
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:48,022
要我猜
My best guess?

382
00:25:48,023 --> 00:25:51,082
墙后有一台地热发电机
There's a geothermal generator behind this wall.

383
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:55,083
那就是能量的源头
That's the power source.

384
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,065
小心这些管子
Careful with these pipes.

385
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:08,066
它们非常烫
They are very hot.

386
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:13,005
没路了
That's it. Nothing.

387
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:17,006
这里堵住了
It's blocked.

388
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,022
你认为怎么样  Sayid
So, what do you think, Sayid?

389
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:24,062
什么认为怎么样  Jack?
What do I think about what, Jack?

390
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:26,099
这个地方  那台电脑
This place, the computer.

391
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,055
你认为到底怎么回事
What do you think is going on?

392
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:32,015
我上次听说像这里这样
The last time I heard of concrete

393
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:34,077
把混凝土到处浇灌的地方...
being poured over everything in this way...

394
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:39,083
是在切尔诺贝利
was Chernobyl.

395
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,045
你撞到什么了么
Did you hit something?

396
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:47,089
我想没有
I don't think so.

397
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,015
声音是从那里传过来的
It's coming from over there.

398
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:55,016
我去看看
I'm gonna check it out.

399
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,035
你...你在淋浴
You...You took a shower.

400
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:24,015
我想看看这还能不能用
Had to see if it worked.

401
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:28,032
怎么样
How was it?

402
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:31,019
水压有点问题
Pressure sucked

403
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,025
而且有时会突然变冷
and it kind of went cold at one point,

404
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,059
水闻起来有一点硫磺的味道
and it smelled a little bit like sulphur,

405
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,045
但是多少还是把澡给洗了
but it was a shower.

406
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:41,039
是啊  我懂你意思
Yeah. I know what you mean.

407
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,035
你也可以来冲一个
You could use one.

408
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,015
过会儿好了
Maybe a little later.

409
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:50,076
给你留了香波
I'll leave the shampoo for you.

410
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,032
我是Libby
I'm Libby.

411
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:07,035
我叫Michael
Michael.

412
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:09,055
你们有多少人
How many of you?

413
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:12,009
我是说  在岛的另一边
You know, on the other side of the island?

414
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,049
我们离开时  大概有40个
When we left, around 40.

415
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,042
你们幸存了多少人
How many of you survived?

416
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:22,086
23个
Twenty-three of us.

417
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,002
你还好吗
Are you all right?

418
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:35,052
你现在倒关心起我来了
Now you give a damn.

419
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:39,052
我说了很抱歉  那是一场误会
I said I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.

420
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:41,052
当我要冰爽茶  而你给我的是柠檬汁
A misunderstanding is when you bring me lemonade

421
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,079
这才叫误会
instead of iced tea.

422
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,062
我说过不准说话
I said no talking.

423
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:47,045
是他在和我说话
He was talking to me!

424
00:28:47,046 --> 00:28:51,019
我们到了
We're here.

425
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,046
你想干什么  把我们绑柱子上
What are you gonna do, beam us up?

426
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:52,035
我记得你说你们有23个人
I thought you said there were 23 of you.

427
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:57,000
以前是的
There were.

428
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:25,040
怎么了
What's wrong?

429
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:29,029
我  我在海里发现了个东西
I, I found something out in the water.

430
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,042
我告诉了Shannon
And I told Shannon about it,

431
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:36,046
然后我们认为应该和你说一下
and we thought you should know...

432
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:46,006
这是竹筏上的那个漂流瓶
It's the messages from the raft.

433
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:53,056
我们想你应该决定做些什么
We thought you should decide what to do.

434
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:01,052
你为什么要告诉Charlie  伙计
Why did you tell Charlie, man?

435
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:05,002
-是他问我的  Hugo  -但你不应该告诉他
-Because he asked, Hugo.  -You shouldn't have.

436
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:07,029
你应该下来听听我的意见
You should have listened to me about coming down here.

437
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,049
现在一切都会改变了  一切
Now,It's all gonna change. Everything.

438
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,059
改变是好事  Hugo
Change is good, Hugo.

439
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,012
人人都这么说  但那不是真的  伙计
You know, people say that, but it's not true, man.

440
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:17,049
相信我  我很清楚
Trust me, I know.

441
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,035
猜猜谁会成为坏人
And guess who gets to be the bad guy?

442
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:21,079
谁会想说"不  你不能拿走那罐
Who says "No, you can't have peanut butter

443
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,065
给那可爱的金发女人和她可怜的婴儿的花生酱"?
for the cute blonde and her poor island baby. "

444
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:27,089
你知道是谁吗  是我
You know who? It's me.

445
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,062
你知道吗  我不想干这个了
You know what? I'm not gonna do it.

446
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:32,095
找其他人来做吧  伙计
Find someone else to deal with the chow, man.

447
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,039
不  我们都有自己该干的事  Hugo
No, we all have our jobs, Hugo.

448
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,089
我的工作是在人们不知道为什么的情况下
My job is to convince people to push a button every 108 minutes

449
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:42,070
说服他们每隔108分钟按一下按键
without them knowing why or for what.

450
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:46,009
-想交换么  -我不想干这个了
-Wanna trade?  -I don't wanna do this, man.

451
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,039
我也曾经有很多我不愿意做的事
I've had lots of jobs I didn't want to do.

452
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,069
但我还是做了
But I still did them.

453
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,089
我很抱歉  Hugo
I'm sorry, Hugo,

454
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,030
你要继续做下去
you don't get to quit.

455
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,060
那好吧
OK, then.

456
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:33,089
小心点
Be careful!

457
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,059
知道了
Dude. I am.

458
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,092
你拿到了吗?
You got it?

459
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:38,032
拿到了
Yeah, I got it.

460
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:42,033
好的  我们走
All right. Let's go!

461
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:45,049
你想我们玩偶拿得够多了吧?
Do you think we got enough gnomes?

462
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,063
是的  我们干得很棒
We're good.

463
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:53,092
真是太聪明了
This is genius.

464
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:56,062
不  不是左边  伙计  角度再大点
No, no, to the left, dude. More of an angle.

465
00:32:57,073 --> 00:33:00,083
快跑
Run!

466
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:10,020
笨蛋
CLUCK YOU

467
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,082
自由了
Freedom!

468
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:16,029
-伙计  你在干什么  -我们自由了
-Dude, what are you doing?  -Freedom!

469
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,039
那么  你今晚还想做些什么吗
So, anything else you wanna do tonight?

470
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,025
你最好让我知道
You'd better let me know now,

471
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:24,032
因为我们一天的休假马上就要结束了  Hugo老兄
because our day off is just about over, Huggy Bear.

472
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:25,085
10小时后
In about ten hours

473
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,079
我们就得为自己找一份新的工作
we're gonna have to find ourselves some new employment.

474
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,015
我听说比萨店正在招人
I hear Pizza Bin is hiring.

475
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:34,012
我们可以去Gyrorama碰碰运气
Or we could try our luck at Gyro-rama.

476
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:36,062
我很喜欢在那工作的漂亮的小妞
I do kind of dig the chick who works at the Bin.

477
00:33:36,063 --> 00:33:39,035
伙计  答应我一些事
Dude, promise me something.

478
00:33:39,036 --> 00:33:41,085
好的  什么?
OK, what?

479
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:45,042
答应我不论发生了什么
Promise me that no matter what happens,

480
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:47,042
我们都不要改变...
we'll never change.

481
00:33:47,043 --> 00:33:49,012
永远不要改变
This'll never change.

482
00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:50,059
好的
OK.

483
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,079
噢  我知道是怎么回事了
Oh! I know what this is about.

484
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,069
我知道你最近为什么这么怪了
I know why you've been acting so weird lately.

485
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,012
你要去做那个  呃... 那个  呃...
You're getting that stomach-stapling

486
00:33:58,013 --> 00:34:00,035
胃分离手术之类的  不是么
surgery thing, aren't you?

487
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:03,022
-我是不会去做手术的  -没事  伙计  这不错的
-I'm not getting surgery.  -Come on, it's cool.

488
00:34:03,023 --> 00:34:05,015
我是说  我仍然可以装做大吃一惊
I mean, I can still be all surprised,

489
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:08,012
就像"哦  天那  Hurley  真的是你么?"
I can be like, "Ooh, my, Hurley. Wow, is that you?"

490
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:11,029
听着Johnny  我是认真的
Listen, Johnny, I'm serious.

491
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:16,082
答应我  我和你永远要维持原状
Promise me that you and I will always stay the same.

492
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,039
我还有更好的
I'll do you one better.

493
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,062
我不止要维持原状  兄弟
Not only will I stay gold, Ponyboy,

494
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:23,019
我还要为此干一杯
I will drink to it.

495
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,043
我能借2块钱吗
Can I borrow two bucks?

496
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,095
你在干什么  Hurley
What you got there, Hurley?

497
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,012
这是炸药
It's dynamite.

498
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:56,083
炸药  你弄来干什么
Dynamite? Well, what are you doing with it?

499
00:34:57,043 --> 00:35:02,043
抱歉  我不能让它再发生了
I'm sorry. But I can't let it happen again.

500
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:14,039
这儿为什么会有记者
Why is there a news crew here?

501
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,052
伙计  我们不要去那里
Dude, we shouldn't go here.

502
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:19,063
伙计  我们走吧  他们只是在抬什么东西 
Dude, let's go, they jack the prices here.

503
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:21,048
可能有人中枪了
Maybe somebody got shot.

504
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:37,039
你为什么这么做  亲爱的
Why are you doing this, honey?

505
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,052
听着  快出去  Rose
Look, just get out of here, Rose.

506
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,059
但是你会伤到人的
But you're gonna hurt somebody.

507
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,029
我不会在门外弄的
Not if I do it from outside the door.

508
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,049
这门很厚
It's thick.

509
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,089
而且我会首先确定附近没人的
And I'll make sure there's nobody around first.

510
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,082
所以拜托你先出去好么
So, please, will you just go?

511
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:51,042
哼哼  是你把我从海滩拉起来
Uh-uh. You haul me off the beach

512
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:52,092
这么大老远拖来这个地方的
and you drag me into this place,

513
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:54,075
那么至少在你引爆前
at least I can get is an explanation

514
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,012
能给我个解释吧
before you blow it up.

515
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:57,062
你不会懂的
You don't get it.

516
00:35:57,063 --> 00:36:01,066
这地方会把事情弄得一团糟
This is gonna mess it all up!

517
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,012
伙计  有人中彩票了
Dude! Somebody won the lottery!

518
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:10,022
让我告诉你吧  Rose
Let me tell you something, Rose.

519
00:36:10,023 --> 00:36:12,065
我们以前都相处得很好  直到我们有了...
We were all fine before we had

520
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:14,062
马铃薯片
any potato chips.

521
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:16,032
当我们有了这些薯片后
Now we've got these potato chips,

522
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,019
每个人都想得到它
everyone's gonna want them.

523
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,052
Steve拿了它们  Charlie不高兴了
So, Steve gets them, Charlie's pissed,

524
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:23,015
但他没有向Steve发火  他是在生我的气
but not pissed at Steve, he's pissed at me.

525
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:25,045
就是那个人
That's the guy!

526
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:29,026
就是他
That's the guy!

527
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:34,039
我就成了大家的目标
And I'm gonna be in the middle of it.

528
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,045
然后就会有人叫"我们的呢?"
And then it's gonna be, "What about us?"

529
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:38,045
"我怎么没有薯片?"
"Why didn't I get any potato chips?"

530
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:40,032
"拜托  帮帮我们  Hurley"
"Come on, help us out, Hurley."

531
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,012
"那你为什么把香波给了Kate?"
"Why did you give Kate the shampoo?"

532
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:44,045
"而我却拿不到花生酱?"
"Why didn't I get the peanut butter?"

533
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:47,052
然后他们就会变得疯狂起来  追问道
Then, they'll get really mad and start asking,

534
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:49,032
"为什么这些东西都是Hugo的"
"Why does Hugo have everything?"

535
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:51,052
"为什么是他来决定分配?"
"Why should he get to decide?"

536
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:56,006
然后他们都会恨我
Then they'll all hate me.

537
00:36:56,013 --> 00:37:01,066
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

538
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:27,064
食物清单都列好了  这是唯一的办法 
Jack, the inventory's done. This is the only way.

539
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:29,074
你是认真的
Are you serious

540
00:37:30,037 --> 00:37:31,041
伙计  那儿的食物够一个人
Dude, there's enough food in there

541
00:37:31,096 --> 00:37:33,049
一天吃三顿并且维持三个月
to feed one guy three meals a day for another three months.

542
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,045
我们有40个人  这点食物一点不够
We have 40 people. It's just not gonna work.

543
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:42,032
听着  你让我来管的话 这件事只能这么做了
Look, you put me in charge, this is what we're doing.

544
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:45,035
好的
OK.

545
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:47,095
好的
OK?

546
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:52,093
是的  好的
Yeah. OK.

547
00:37:56,023 --> 00:38:00,043
好的
OK.

548
00:41:07,076 --> 00:41:10,059
打扰一下
Excuse me.

549
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:17,032
你们来的那里
Back where you guys,

550
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:19,032
那群人里
where you came from...

551
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:23,065
有一个叫Rose的女人吗
is there a woman named Rose there?

552
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:28,036
50多岁的黑人?
Black chick in her fifties?

553
00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:33,019
她...
Is she...

554
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,055
她还好么?
is she OK?

555
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:38,022
是的  伙计
Yeah, man.

556
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:41,093

谢谢
Oh, thank you.

558
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:48,029
