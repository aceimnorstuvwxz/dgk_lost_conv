00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:15,079
Alex...

4
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,037
他们带走了我的孩子
They took my baby.

5
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:28,031
有人么  救救我
Somebody, please help me!

6
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:31,045
他拿着一种...一种像针的东西
He had this...this thing, like...like a needle,

7
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,088
然后刺了我
and he stabbed me with it.

8
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:36,059
他想伤害我的孩子
He was trying to hurt my baby.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,049
我们有麻烦了  旅客名单
We got a problem. The manifest

10
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:41,038
幸存者的名单...
the names of everyone who survived...

11
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:44,041
我问了所有人  有一个人不在旅客名单上...
I interviewed everyone. One of them isn't in the manifest...

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,036
你们好
Hello there.

13
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:54,020
我想他们是被劫持了
I think they've been taken.

14
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:55,026
Claire!

15
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:05,021
我不记得Ethan
I don't remember Ethan.

16
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,059
我不记得他对我做了什么
I don't remember what he did to me.

17
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,072
救命
Help me!

18
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:13,058
别相信他说的  他是他们中的一个
Don't believe a word he says! He's one of them.

19
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,072
我不知道她在讲什么
I have no idea what she's talking about.

20
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:18,095
他会一直说谎
For a long time, he will lie.

21
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,090
我不知道为什么你问我这些问题
I don't know why you're asking me all these questions.

22
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:23,017
这全是误会
This is all a mistake.

23
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,015
告诉我真相  告诉我你是谁
Tell me the truth! Tell me who you are!

24
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:28,048
如果他说的是真的呢  John?
What if he's telling the truth, John?

25
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:29,080
如果不是呢?
What if he's not?

26
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,094
没事的  亲爱的
Hey, it's okay, sweetie.

27
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,083
亲爱的  没事的
Hey, sweetie, it's all right.

28
00:01:55,076 --> 00:02:00,033
-John?  John?  醒醒   -什么  Claire?  怎么了?
-John? John? Wake up.  -What, Claire? What?

29
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:03,076
他烧得很厉害  并且出现皮疹了
He's burning up, and he's got a rash.

30
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:06,022
我得找到Jack
And I need to find Jack.

31
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,013
他  呃  他在舱里轮班
He's, uh, he's on shift at the hatch.

32
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,002
-好的   -呃  不  Claire  等等
-Okay.  -Uh, no, Claire, wait.

33
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,006
-Claire  等等   -不  不行  John  我不能等了
-Claire, wait.  -No, I can't, John, okay?

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,005
不不不  这么晚了你不能去丛林里
No, no, no. You're not walking through the jungle in the middle of the night.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,033
我去找Jack 我马上把他带来
I'll go get Jack. I'll send him right back here.

36
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:27,013
-好的   -别担心
-Okay.  -Don't worry.

37
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:38,028
Jack

38
00:02:41,023 --> 00:02:42,013
怎么了?
What's going on?

39
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,021
孩子发烧了
The baby's got a fever.

40
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:48,005
-发烧了?   -Claire还想亲自过来
-A fever?  -Claire was coming here.

41
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:53,099
-他睡了么?   -整晚没响过一声
-He asleep?  -Not a sound all night.

42
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:59,013
我尽快赶回来
I'll get back here as soon as I can.

43
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:18,051
亲爱的  没事的  没事的
Hey, hey, sweetie, it's okay. It's okay.

44
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:23,052
妈妈马上让你凉下来  好么? 好么?  嘘  没事的
Mommy's just gonna cool you down, okay? Okay? Shh. It's okay.

45
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,074
你在这儿干什么?  离我们远点
What are you doing here? You stay away from us!

46
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:34,097
他是被感染的  是么?
He's infected, isn't he?

47
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,056
什么?
What?

48
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,054
你的孩子...他病了
Your child...he's sick.

49
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:44,045
走开  离我们远点
Just get away. You get away from us!

50
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,098
你记不得了  是么?
You don't remember, do you?

51
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,096
这是疫苗  我们得防止他生病
It's a vaccine. We don't want him to get sick.

52
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:01,006
嘿  回去  离她远点
Hey, get back! Get away from her!

53
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,088
你来这儿想干什么?
What do you think you're doing here?

54
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,024
你来这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,012
离开我们的营地
Just get out of our camp.

56
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,079
怎么了?
What happened?

57
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,068
她说什么了?
What did she say?

58
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:26,036
她说孩子出问题了
She said there's something wrong with him.

59
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,099
这不像他  他以前整晚都睡着的
It's just not like him. He always sleeps through the night.

60
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:52,080
这种皮疹...我是说  可能出问题了
And this rash...I mean, there's something wrong.

61
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,003
孩子病了  Claire
Babies get sick, Claire.

62
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,000
好吧  发烧和咳嗽怎么解释呢?
Okay, what about the fever and cough?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,044
很正常的现象
Perfectly normal.

64
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:57,055
他已经吃不下东西了  还有...
And he hasn't been eating at all, and...

65
00:04:57,055 --> 00:05:00,093
Claire  他没事的  可能得了红疹
Claire, he's okay. It's probably roseola.

66
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:03,081
在他这种年龄是很普通的病
It's a typical virus that's common in children his age,

67
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,031
皮疹就是一种症状
and the rash is a sign of it.

68
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:07,030
好吧  那如果不是呢?
Okay. What if it's not?

69
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,053
如果他得了更严重的病呢?
What if he caught something really bad?

70
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,078
像是感染什么的?
Like some kind of infection?

71
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:15,030
感染?  你怎么想到这个的?
Infection? Where did you get that idea?

72
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:17,043
Rousseau来过这儿
Rousseau was here.

73
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,008
她对你说了什么?
What did she say to you?

74
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,008
她说她知道他病了  他是被感染的
She said she knew he was sick, okay? That he's infected.

75
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:27,013
Claire  这不是被感染的
Claire, there is no infection.

76
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:30,071
我们在这个岛已经两个月了 没有人生病
We've been on this island for two months, and no one's gotten sick.

77
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,088
Rousseau有点不正常
Rousseau's crazy.

78
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,050
我们按发烧来治他
We're gonna let the fever just run its course.

79
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,073
会没事的  好么?  相信我
It's gonna be fine, okay? Trust me.

80
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:39,085
我得回去舱里
I've gotta get back to the hatch.

81
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:43,018
我会在几小时后再来看他  好么?
And I'll come back in a couple hours and check on him again, okay?

82
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,067
-好么?   -好的
-Okay?  -Yeah.

83
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,089
如果他出什么问题的话   我肯定Jack会知道的
Hey,  I'm sure that if there was something wrong, Jack would know.

84
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,094
你确定要这么做么? 我们和她不熟
Are you sure about this? We don't really know her.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,037
我想她能帮我
I think she can help me.

86
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,063
嘿  你们好
Hey, guys.

87
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:14,034
你是神经医生  对么?
So you're a shrink, right?

88
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:20,005
我是临床心理医生   也可以说是神经医生
I'm a clinical psychologist, but "shrink" works, too.

89
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,079
你能帮人回忆事情么?
Can you help people remember things?

90
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:26,045
我想这取决于你想回忆什么
I guess it depends on what you need to remember.

91
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,032
那是我们在这个岛上的第二周
So it was our second week on the island.

92
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,031
我去了丛林里  并且我...
I was out in the jungle, and I...

93
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:36,010
我怀着孩子  Charlie和我在一起
I thought I was having the baby. Charlie was with me.

94
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,073
然后Ethan来了
And there was this man...Ethan.

95
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:41,086
我们以为他和我们一样 也是飞机上的 但却不是
We thought he was one of us from the plane, but he wasn't.

96
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:45,053
他劫持了我...他带走了我们两个 然后...
So  he took me...he took both of us. And...

97
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:48,076
我记不得了  我什么都想不起来了
I don't remember. I don't remember anything.

98
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:52,047
当Jack和我找到Charlie时 他被围着脖子吊在了树上
When Jack and I found Charlie, he was hanging from a tree by his neck.

99
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,011
我不知道发生了什么
I have no idea what happened,

100
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:56,057
现在我只能回想起一点点的片段
and now I'm seeing these flashes of things.

101
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:59,018
并且  你知道  我有健忘症
And, you know, I have amnesia.

102
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,078
两周时间就从我的生命里丢失了
There's two weeks missing from my life.

103
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:04,049
Claire  我不认为你有健忘症
Claire, I don't think you have amnesia.

104
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:07,031
你知道  有时候当一些可怕的事降临时
You know, sometimes when something terrible happens to us,

105
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:10,021
你的脑子想到的只是怎么保护自己
there's a little switch in your head that flicks on to protect us

106
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:12,096
而不是怎么去应对
from having to deal with it.

107
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:15,023
你的记忆可能还在
Maybe your memories aren't gone.

108
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:17,085
也许它们只是被阻挡在你脑子里了
Maybe you're just blocking them.

109
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:23,043
那现在我需要你来解开阻碍
Then I need you to unblock them.

110
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,072
因为我孩子病了  并且他们曾经对他做过什么
'Cause my baby's sick, and they did something to him.

111
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:43,016
你需要去洗澡么?
Do you have to go to the bathroom?

112
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,054
好 那么想去的时候和我们说一声吧
Well, just let us know when you do.

113
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:48,024
好的  我希望如此
Yeah, I'll look forward to that.

114
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:55,083
你可能想读点什么
Thought you might like something to read.

115
00:07:55,091 --> 00:08:00,020
Dostoevsky的小说  你没有Stephen King的么?
Dostoevsky. You don't have any Stephen King?

116
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,009
这个图书馆有点过时
The library's a little outdated.

117
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:06,042
好的  谢谢
Right. Well, thanks.

118
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,070
干吗给他本书?
What's with the book?

119
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,069
让他消遣消遣
Just something to pass the time.

120
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:23,077
你知道Hemingway很妒忌Dostoevsky么?
Did you know that Hemingway was jealous of Dostoevsky?

121
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:27,028
不  John  我不知道
No, John, I didn't know that.

122
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,018
他想成为世界上最伟大的作家
He wanted to be the world's greatest writer

123
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:34,017
但是他却始终不能摆脱Dostoevsky的阴影
but convinced himself that he could never get out from under Dostoevsky's shadow.

124
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:35,065
很可惜  真的
Kind of sad, really.

125
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,015
我们该怎么做  Jack?
What are we doing, Jack?

126
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,042
该怎么做什么?
What are we doing?

127
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:42,040
我们不能永远把他藏在这儿
We can't hide him down here forever.

128
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:45,044
轮班的时候会有人发现的
Changing shifts around is gonna get people asking questions.

129
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:48,023
我只是想知道有什么长远打算
I just want to know what the long-term plan is.

130
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:52,036
John  我来问问你...
Well, John, let me ask you this...

131
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,061
对于那个按键我们没什么长远打算
we don't have a long-term plan for the button,

132
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:57,007
但是我们还是坚持去按  不是么?
but we keep pushing it, don't we?

133
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:03,087
听着  在我们知道他是谁   他说出真相以前
Look, until we know who he is, whether or not he's telling the truth,

134
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:07,000
我们该怎么做就怎么做
we have to keep doing what we're doing.

135
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,067
如果你有更好的主意  可以说来听听
If you've got a better idea, let's hear it.

136
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,099
你放我走怎么样?
How about you let me go?

137
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:23,094
现在我们清静了
Now we're away from all the noises of the camp.

138
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:26,015
呼吸
Just breathe.

139
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,052
全身放松
Let your whole body relax.

140
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,040
好的
Good.

141
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,029
听着海浪声
Listen to the waves.

142
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,011
好的  吸...
Good, in...

143
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:45,041
慢慢地呼...  好的
and out slowly. Good.

144
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,004
闭上眼睛
Keep your eyes closed.

145
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,081
放轻松  Claire
Very relaxed, Claire.

146
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:57,026
保持呼吸
Just keep breathing.

147
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,038
现在我要你看见你怀孕时的样子
Now I want you to visualize yourself when you were pregnant.

148
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:05,016
注意听我的声音
Keep listening to my voice.

149
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,013
想想你看见了什么
Think about what you see.

150
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,092
这是疫苗  我们得防止他生病
It's a vaccine. We don't want him to get sick.

151
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:24,040
你上一次身体检查是什么时候 Claire?
When was your last checkup, Claire?

152
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,081
噢  有段时间了
Oh, I haven't been in a while.

153
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,042
我一直很忙 而且...
I've been busy, and...

154
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:32,084
我正要去洛杉矶
I'm going to Los Angeles.

155
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:34,027
-真的么?  -是的
-Really?  -Yeah.

156
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,098
在你快要生的时后去旅行 这可不好
Traveling in your third trimester, that's not usually recommended.

157
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:43,056
在那儿有户人家   我...想把孩子寄养在那儿
Uh, there's a family there. I'm, uh, giving the baby up for adoption.

158
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,024
当然  我了解
Oh, of course. I understand.

159
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,071
我给你的止痛药是很轻微的
The sedative I gave you is very mild.

160
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,015
我知道这些测验很紧迫
I know these exams can be very stressful.

161
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,036
现在要给你打一针  Claire
I'm going to give you a shot now, Claire.

162
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:02,058
一点给孩子的药物
A little medicine for your baby.

163
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:18,076
别担心  你只会感到一丝刺痛
Don't worry. You're just gonna feel a little pinch.

164
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:27,046
没事的  你很好  没事的  没事的
It's okay. You're all right. It's okay. It's okay.

165
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,044
是Ethan  我看见Ethan了
It was Ethan! I saw Ethan!

166
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:33,015
我看到他了  是Ethan
I saw him. It was Ethan!

167
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,013
-Claire  Claire  没事的   -不  有事的
-Claire, Claire, it's okay.   -No, it's not!

168
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,019
-你很好   -不  我不好
-You're all right.  -No, I'm not all right!

169
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
-你做了什么?   -没什么  她...
-What did you do?  -Nothing, she just...

170
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,066
再来一次
Do it again!

171
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,074
再来一次
Do it again!

172
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:48,029
不  Claire  你快发狂了
No, Claire, you were screaming.

173
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:49,086
但是我记起来了  好么?
But I remembered, okay?

174
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:51,090
-我看到了Ethan   -Claire...
-I saw Ethan.  -Claire...

175
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,047
他在那儿  他在给我做测验
He was there, and he was giving me an exam.

176
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:56,082
你看见的可能是你坠机前的经历
What you saw could be combining experiences of what happened before the crash

177
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,029
和现在岛上的经历混起来的事
to the things that happened here on the island.

178
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,026
不  好么  不  这是真的
No, okay, no! This was real!

179
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,092
我被打麻药了
I was drugged.

180
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,023
他对我做过什么
He did something to me.

181
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,065
Claire  你得冷静下来 好么?  这对你不好
Claire, you need to calm down, all right? It's not good for you.

182
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:08,049
你知道么?  Aaron病了  好么?
You know what? Aaron is sick, okay?

183
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,020
我得找到那个地方
I need to find that place!

184
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:12,091
那个房间...是真的  是真的
That room...it's real. It's real.

185
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,091
好么  那儿有药  给孩子的药
Okay, and there's medicine there. For the baby.

186
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:19,070
我要找到那地方  我要去找
I need to find it. I need to find it.

187
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:26,014
Kate  求你了  帮我找到那地方
Kate, Kate, please, help me find it.

188
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,047
怎么...  
What's the...

189
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,046
-有人么?  -你好
-Hello?  -Howdy.

190
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:13,096
你好  John  你一个人么?
Hello, John. You are alone?

191
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:15,063
你来了就不是了
Not anymore.

192
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:17,090
-你们有多少...  -闭嘴
-How many of you...  -Shut up.

193
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,034
我想借把锯子
I was hoping to borrow a saw.

194
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:27,042
当然可以  跟我来吧
Absolutely. Right this way.

195
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:45,011
我需要把枪  你不要问我为什么
I need a gun, and you don't get to ask why.

196
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:51,037
恩  小姐  所有枪都在我这儿   我得问为什么
Well, Thelma, seeing as I got all the guns, I do get to ask why.

197
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,099
-不  你不需要知道   -不  我要知道
-No, you don't.  -Yes, I do.

198
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,073
听着
Watch.

199
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,022
为什么?
Why?

200
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:00,076
给我把枪  Sawyer
Just give me a gun, Sawyer.

201
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,040
来看看
Check it out.

202
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:07,092
我找到了一副新的眼镜  喜欢么?
I found a new pair of glasses damn near my prescription. You like 'em?

203
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,035
好吧  我们要去丛林里追踪Rousseau
All right, I'm going into the jungle to track down Rousseau.

204
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:17,033
那个法国人?  为了什么?
The french chick? What for?

205
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:20,071
Claire认为她知道哪里有药物
Claire thinks she knows where there might be some medicine.

206
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,070
孩子病了
The baby's sick.

207
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:25,097
-恩  药我这儿有   -她认为他病得很厉害
-Well, hell, I got medicine.  -She thinks he's really sick

208
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,030
是需要隔离的那种病
as in "quarantine" sick.

209
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:31,077
你认为呢?
What do you think?

210
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,080
我想她是过于担心了
I think she's a little too worried.

211
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:37,053
但是她要去追Rousseau 不管我是否同去
But she's going after Rousseau with or without me.

212
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,000
男人不许去  是么?
No boys allowed, huh?

213
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:49,090
好吧  你要什么? 9毫米手枪  还是来复枪?
All right, what do you want? 9 millimeter or rifle?

214
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,070
我不认为这是个好主意
I don't think this is a good idea.

215
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:00,064
也许你该听Jack的
Maybe you should listen to Jack.

216
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:02,045
但是如果Jack错了呢?
But what if jack's wrong, okay?

217
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:05,049
Jack说热度会降下来  但是没有 反而越来越糟了
Jack said the fever would break, and it hasn't. He's getting worse.

218
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:07,049
只是因为还没开始降  不是...
Just because it hasn't broken yet, it doesn't...

219
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,062
那么  我还要等多久  Sun?
Well, how long am I supposed to wait, Sun?

220
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,044
母亲不应该离开她的孩子的
A mother should not leave her child.

221
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:21,005
不好意思  你是母亲么?
I'm sorry. Are you a mother?

222
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:22,032
不是...
No...

223
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,096
我不是
I'm not.

224
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:31,084
Claire  你确定你想这么做?
Claire, are you sure you want to do this?

225
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,093
你说什么?
What did you say?

226
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:39,012
你确定你想这么做?
Are you sure you want to do this?

227
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,066
你得确定
You need to be sure.

228
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,025
你得离开这儿...
You have to get out of here...

229
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,072
你要把那个打到我肚子里么?
Do you have to put that in my tummy?

230
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:57,034
这会非常非常痛
'Cause it really, really hurts.

231
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:58,033
我知道
I know.

232
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,002
我希望还有其他办法
I wish there was another way.

233
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:04,020
但是孩子需要它  Claire
But the baby needs it, Claire.

234
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,080
好么?
Okay?

235
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:08,057
好的
Okay.

236
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:24,041
好了  可以了 不是太痛  是么?
There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?

237
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,012
是的
No.

238
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:30,089
考虑到你是个好女孩
And now because you've been such a good girl,

239
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,047
我想我该给你个惊喜
I think it's time for a surprise.

240
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,093
Claire  这边  我们走这边
Claire, this way. Here we go.

241
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,017
在这儿
Over here.

242
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,026
这是哪儿?
What is this place?

243
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:12,018
-这是给你的孩子的  Claire   -噢  太不可思议了
-It's for your baby, Claire.  -Oh, it's amazing.

244
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:23,051
Charlie怎么样了?
What...what happened to Charlie?

245
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,007
Charlie?  噢  他很好
Charlie? Oh, he's fine.

246
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:27,081
当我们离营地够远时  我让他回去
When we got far enough from camp, I let him go back.

247
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,003
那么这些都是从哪儿来的?
So where did it all come from?

248
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:36,031
我很乐意解释给你听  Claire
Well, I'd love to explain everything to you, Claire,

249
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:39,040
但是我想现在对你来说还太难以接受了
but I'm afraid it would be a little overwhelming right now.

250
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:49,070
来吧  打开它
Go ahead, turn it on.

251
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:09,042
等我一下  我马上回来
Wait here. I'll be right back.

252
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,041
到底发生了什么?
What the hell happened?

253
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:22,056
你应该列出一个名单  然后把她算上 是我没说清楚么?
You were supposed to make the list and then bring her in. Was I unclear?

254
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:23,075
这不是我的错
It's not my fault.

255
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:26,069
他们知道我不是飞机上的 他们有旅客名单
They knew I wasn't on the plane. They had a manifest.

256
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,004
那么我该怎么和他说?
Well, what am I supposed to tell him?

257
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:34,071
你知道他了解后会怎么做? 该死的  Ethan
You know what he's gonna do when he finds out? Damn it, Ethan.

258
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,002
出去
Get out.

259
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:44,079
快离开这儿
Get out of here.

260
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:49,053
Claire?

261
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:54,024
Claire  你还好吧?
Claire, are you all right?

262
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:57,003
我  呃...
I, um...

263
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,026
可以走了么?
Ready to go?

264
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:12,044
亲爱的 嘘 妈妈要走了 亲爱的 好吗
Hey, sweetheart, shh, mommy's gotta go now, sweetheart, okay?

265
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:15,015
别哭了  别哭了  没事的
Shh, don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

266
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:18,050
我马上就回来  我会让你变好的 好么?
I'll be back really soon. And I'll make you feel all better, okay?

267
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:19,043
我保证
I promise.

268
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,021
谢谢
Thanks.

269
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,029
好的
Okay.

270
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,090
-你还好吧?  -是的
-You okay?  -Yeah.

271
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,085
你肯定她是往这儿走的么?
Are you sure this is her trail?

272
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:53,027
我们是从把她赶走的地方开始找的
We started at the exact spot where we chased her off the beach.

273
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,075
那么你对Rousseau了解多少?
So what do you know about Rousseau?

274
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,007
不多
Not much.

275
00:19:57,036 --> 00:20:00,033
你去"黑岩石"那儿时  你们一直呆在一起
You spent all that time with her when you went out to "the Black Rock."

276
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:02,021
你们肯定说了什么
You must have talked about something.

277
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,068
她的船在这儿撞毁了...
Just  about her ship crashing here...

278
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,002
她和她的研究队束手无策
her and her research team getting stranded.

279
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:08,095
他们怎么了?
What happened to them?

280
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:11,096
他们死了
They died.

281
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:14,036
怎么死的?
How?

282
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:18,020
我们跟丢了
Tracks are gone. Trail ends here.

283
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:20,060
Kate  他们是怎么死的?
Kate, how did they die?

284
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:23,063
她杀了他们
She killed them.

285
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:24,055
什么?
What?

286
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:28,054
-为什么...为什么她...  -因为他们被感染了
-Why...why would she...  -Because they were infected.

287
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,061
你现在相信我了  是么?
You believe me now, don't you?

288
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:36,079
我要你带我回那儿去
I want you to take me back there.

289
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,009
回去?
Back?

290
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:40,086
-去我抓伤你的地方   -Claire...
-To where I scratched you.   -Claire...

291
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:43,013
不  好了  我记起来了  她知道的
No, okay, she knows I remember.

292
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:45,031
我现在记起很多事了
I remember a lot of it now.

293
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:50,049
我记得一个房间  药物  一个年轻女孩
I remember the room, the medicine, a teenage girl.

294
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,002
好了  所以别骗我
Okay, so don't lie to me

295
00:20:52,012 --> 00:20:54,067
别假装你听不懂我说什么
and make out you don't know what I'm talking about.

296
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:59,034
我孩子病了   你现在马上带我去那儿拿我要的药物
My baby is sick, and you're gonna take me back there to get what he needs right now.

297
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:04,039
那地方离这儿不远
It's not far from here.

298
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,084
能和你谈一下么?
may I have a word with you?

299
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:24,062
当然
Sure.

300
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:28,024
他是谁?
Who is he?

301
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,076
什么?
What?

302
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:33,059
你藏在舱子里的那个人
The man that you are keeping in the hatch.

303
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:40,006
Locke和你说...
Did Locke tell you...

304
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:43,028
Locke没和我说任何事  他是谁?
Locke did not tell me anything. Who is he?

305
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,003
我们不知道
We don't know.

306
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,062
我想和他说话
I wish to speak to him.

307
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,063
和他说什么?
Speak to him about what?

308
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:53,047
我想单独和他说
I wish to speak to him alone.

309
00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:55,087
你能安排么?
Can you arrange this?

310
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,068
我为什么要安排?
Why should I do that?

311
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:03,046
因为你想让这件事保密
Because you wish to keep this a secret.

312
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:28,033
我们为什么停在这儿?
Why are we stopping here?

313
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,068
这就是你抓伤我的地方
This  is where you scratched me.

314
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:34,099
但是这儿什么都没有
But there's nothing here.

315
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:38,043
我们下面去哪儿?
Where do we go next?

316
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:40,042
你为什么问我?
Why are you asking me that?

317
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:41,096
你得告诉我去哪儿
You need to tell me where to go!

318
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,041
房间在哪儿?
Where is this room?!

319
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:45,022
你怎么能那么说?
Look, how can you be saying that?

320
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:47,085
好了  你抱着我  所以我抓了你...
Okay, you grabbed me. That's why I scratched you...

321
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:49,095
因为你要把我带回他们那里去
because you were taking me back to them!

322
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,090
这是你认为的么?
Is that what you think?

323
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:55,048
你说你记起来了
You said you remembered.

324
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,084
所以我带你来这里
That's why I brought you here.

325
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:00,005
你骗了我   
You lied!

326
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,067
把你的手拿开
Get your hands off of her.

327
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:16,075
开枪吧
Go ahead.

328
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:19,013
求你了
Please.

329
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,026
Claire

330
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,027
醒醒
Wake up.

331
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:00,083
怎么样了?
How's it coming?

332
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:04,019
一个做好了  还剩一个
One down. One to go.

333
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:06,094
现在我们就缺一只小脚把它穿上了 不是么?
Now all's we need is a little foot to put it on, huh?

334
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,035
我跟你说...
Tell you what...

335
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:12,059
我们偷偷出去散散步  你说好么?
what do you say we sneak out of here and take a walk?

336
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:15,004
好的
Okay.

337
00:24:19,031 --> 00:24:21,085
我很抱歉现在才安排你出来
I'm sorry this is the first time I've managed to get you out.

338
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:23,054
我的朋友怕你会逃跑
My friends are afraid you'll run away.

339
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:28,028
-别出卖我  好么?    -好的
-Don't tell on me, okay?    -Oh, okay.

340
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,094
休息一下
Whoa. Easy now.

341
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:35,099
慢点  慢点  
Easy. Easy! Whoa.

342
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:38,031

343
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:40,007

谢谢
Thanks.

345
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:47,056
怎么了?
What?

346
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:49,089
-太酸了  -是么?
-That is really sour.  -Is it?

347
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:51,060
我没注意到
I hadn't noticed.

348
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:53,066
好无聊
Blah.

349
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:58,066
嘿...他在踢我
Hey...he's kicking.

350
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,067
-可以么?    -恩...
-May I?    -Yeah...

351
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,090
Claire  可以告诉你个秘密么?
Claire, can I tell you a secret?

352
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:10,049
好的
Yes.

353
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:14,048
我会想念你的  我...
I'm gonna miss you. I wi...

354
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:19,012
你希望你可以不要走
I wish you didn't have to go.

355
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,084
也许我不需要走
Maybe I don't have to go.

356
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,025
我们一起经历了这些  Claire
We've been through this, Claire.

357
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,019
给你和你孩子的疫苗不够用了
There's not enough vaccine for you and the baby.

358
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,033
但是我...我没病啊
But I'm not...I'm not sick.

359

谢天谢地
Thank god.

360
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,088
一旦你孩子生下来之后 你就可以回你朋友那儿了
And once you've delivered, you can go back to your friends,

361
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:36,085
希望你会没事
and hopefully you'll stay that way.

362
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:43,034
如果我要看孩子呢?
What...what if I want to see the baby?

363
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:51,060
除非你愿意  没人可以把他带走
Hey, nobody's going to take him from you unless that's what you want.

364
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:53,049
你有你的选择
You have a choice.

365
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,043
我们是好人  Claire
We're good people, Claire.

366
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:02,072
我们是一个好家庭
We're a good family.

367
00:26:03,087 --> 00:26:06,012
如果你信任我们  就可以把孩子留下
But if you're gonna trust us with your child,

368
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:10,023
我要你肯定
I want you to be sure.

369
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,070

377
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:02,034
找什么?
Look for what?

378
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,002
Claire

379
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,042
Claire

380
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,020
手电筒
Flashlights.

381
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:48,014
有灯  我看看能不能打开电源
There are lights. I'm gonna see if I can turn the power on.

382
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,090
你还好吧?

This way.

384

这是哪儿?
What is this place?

385
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:43,013
这是他们为我孩子准备的
It's where they were gonna keep him.

386

听着  你得离开这儿
Look, you have to get out of here.

小心点和他说

他又聪明又好奇

464
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,086
你好了就叫我们

并且我不知道为什么...

你成了囚犯是因为他们很小心

他们很小心是因为他们认为你在说谎

481
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:24,065
他们认为我是..."其他人"中的一个? 其他什么人?

你为什么和我说这些?

因为我需要和某个人说
