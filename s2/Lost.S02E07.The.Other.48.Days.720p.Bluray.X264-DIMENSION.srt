你可以问问别人  但我没有
You can ask around, but I couldn't find any.

69
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:45,000
马上就要天黑了

105
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:39,082
我不知道  但是他们在丛林中  没穿鞋子
I don't know. But they're out here in the jungle with no shoes,

106
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:44,070
口袋里没有东西 衣服上也没有商标
nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes.

107
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:49,047
这些人是在我们之前来这个岛的
These people were here before us.

108
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,076
我们得离开海滩

109
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,098
我们得找个安全的地方

我们有孩子还有重伤者

还有这烽火呢?
What about the signal fire?

114
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,053
我们都离开了海滩还怎么等救援呢?
How are we all gonna get rescued if we're off the beach?

115
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:12,090
Nathan说的对
Nathan's right.

116
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,017
他们有卫星  还有黑匝子
They have satellites. The black box.

117
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:18,088
我们不需要靠烽火来请求救援
We don't need a fire for them to find us.

118
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:22,073
不  我们需要

Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication. We were turning back.

120

我们往另一个方向飞了有两小时之多
We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction.

121
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,039
他们不知道到哪儿来找我们
They don't know where to look.

122
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:13,015
他的腿...感染已经越来越严重了
His leg...the infection is getting worse.

123
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:17,064
他会是第四个死的人
He'll be the fourth to go.

124
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:22,058
我们还能怎么做?
What are we supposed to do about that?

125
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:08,011
加油  加油  抓住它抓住它

129

要来些鸡肉么?
Would you like some chicken?

130
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:59,012
你有一周没说话了
You haven't said a word in a week.

131
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:03,032
你为什么不说话?
Why aren't you talking?

132
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,086
你知道  那不是你的错
It wasn't your fault, you know.

133
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:17,038
你只是在自我防卫
You were just defending yourself.

134
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:38,088
-这东西很管用  -是的
-That'll work.  -Yeah...

135
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:41,054
我在那儿听到了猪或是什么的叫声
I heard a pig or something out there.

136
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:45,074
也许我们明天能吃熏肉了
Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.

137
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,035
怎么了?
What?

138
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:01,010
你去哪儿了?
Where were you?

139
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,099
我去上厕所了
I had to go to the bathroom.

140
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:05,008
我们有规定
We have a system for that.

141
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:08,085
至少要两人一起去
We go in pairs.

142
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:12,043
抱歉
Yeah, sorry.

143
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,033
救命
Help us! Please!

144
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,032
孩子们
The kids!

145
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:04,071
他们抢走了孩子
They took the kids!

146
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,034
他们带走了Jed和Eli
I can't find them! And they took Jim and Eli!

147
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,095
Nancy不见了
Nancy's gone!

148
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:23,025
他们逃了
They're gone.

149
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,019
他们往哪儿去了?
Which way did they go?

150
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:29,000
他们往哪儿去了?
Which way did they go?

151
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:32,002
醒醒  醒醒
Wake up! Wake up!

152
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:34,047
你是谁?  说话啊  醒醒
Who are you? Talk to me! Wake up!

153
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:36,043
她死了
She's dead!

154
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:39,051
她死了
She's dead.

155
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:47,024
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

156
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:52,052
那是一把刀?
Is that a knife?

157
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,085
那是什么?
What is that?

158
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:08,094
是个名单
 It's a list

159
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:12,043
什么名单?
A list of what?

160
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:17,008
我们之中的...九个人
Nine... of us.

161
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:28,065
没找到?
Nothing?

162
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,027
他们抢走了9个人
They drag nine people

163
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,001
包括孩子们
into the jungle, the kids...

164
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:37,048
而他们就没留一点痕迹?
...and there's no sign of them?

165
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:44,002
现在还不是一个说话的好时机么?
Now's not a good time to talk?

166
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,040
我们得想办法让你说话
What needs to happen to make you say something?

167
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,010
冷静点让我们仔细想想
Hey! Calm down, let's figure this out.

168
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,052
"冷静点"?
"Calm down,

169
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:55,060
"让我们仔细想想"?
let's figure this out"?

170
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,012
这是他们带走的九个人的名字...
Here are the names of every single person they took, all nine of them.

171
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,098
他们穿什么  他们长得怎样...全部都有
What they were wearing, what they look like.

172
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:06,058
他们中有人有我们的名册
One of them had a list of us.

173
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,097
他们可能是从已经带走的那些人的口里知道我们的名字的
They could a got our names from the people they took.

174
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:11,093
第一天晚上没人知道每个人的名字
Nobody knew any names the first night.

175
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:15,023
可能他们在监视我们
Maybe they're watching us.

176
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:18,080
你昨天消失了两个小时
You were gone for two hours yesterday.

177
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,051
什么?
What?

178
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:21,064
-你去哪儿了?  -我去上厕所了
-Where were you?  -I was going to the bathroom.

179
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:23,080
嘿  好了
Hey, stop!

180
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,048
我们都很害怕
We're all scared.

181
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,081
我们别在这儿瞎猜了
Let's not get paranoid here.

182
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:30,065
我们什么都不知道
We don't know anything.

183
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:31,097
他说的对
He's right.

184
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:35,025
他们为什么要在我们这儿卧底?
Why would they try to infiltrate us?

185
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,086
我是说  这很疯狂
Now, that's crazy.

186
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:39,011
不管他们是谁,他们知道我们在这儿
Well, whoever they are, they know we are here.

187
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,097
我们得离开海滩
We need to leave this beach.

188
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:48,010
你说我们得让烽火一直燃着
You said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.

189
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:52,080
我想我们该把它熄了
I think it's time we let it go out.

190
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:34,012
休息5分钟
Five minutes.

191
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:38,050
我们一路走了3天了
We've been walking for three days.

192
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,089
但是还只走到这儿  休息5分钟
And you're still here. Five minutes.

193
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:44,083
你知道么?  你们想继续走那就走吧
Know what? You all wanna keep walking, go ahead.

194
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:48,036
清水  有岩石作屏障 还有许多水果树
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs, lots of fruit trees,

195
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:52,006
这儿对我来说很不错
right here looks pretty good to me.

196
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:03,077
好吧
Fine. OK.

197
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:07,029
这地方不错
This'll work.

198
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,069
在海滩时  他们来的那个晚上
Back at the beach, the night they came back,

199
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:33,052
你说Nathan消失了两个小时
you said that Nathan was gone for two hours, that he was missing.

200
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:37,074
我看到他是偷偷溜出去的  Ana
He creeps me out, Ana.

201
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,092
你真的认为我们中的一个人...
You really think it's possible that one of us is...

202
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:46,009
是他们的卧底么?
one of them?

203
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:50,052
那你想我挖这个洞来做什么?
Why do you think I'm digging this hole?

204
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:59,078
这东西真能抓住野兔么?
We gonna catch rabbits with this?

205
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:03,056
是的  再给我根棒子
Hell, yeah. Give me another stick.

206
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:10,040
嘿  Ana
Hey, Ana.

207
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:13,054
Ana!

208
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:23,014
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

209
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:26,098
你得和我谈谈  Nathan
You and I are gonna have a talk.

210
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:29,064
你马上放我出去
You let me out of here right now!

211
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:33,058
放我出去 放我出去  否则...
You let me out! You let me out, or I'll...

212
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:34,070
我什么都没做  Ana
I didn't do anything, Ana!

213
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,031
-他不是我们飞机上的  -什么?
-He wasn't on the plane.  -What?

214
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:37,088
我们飞了两个多小时
We were in the air two hours.

215
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:39,087
我没见过他  一次都没有
I didn't see him once. Not once.

216
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:41,047
飞机很大  Ana 只是因为你没有...
It's a big plane.

217
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:42,089
不  我也没看到过他
I didn't see him either.

218
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:46,060
我很善于记住乘客的样子 而且我肯定没见过他
I'm pretty good with faces, of the passengers. I did not see him.

219
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,003
等等  你们在开玩笑吧
You're not all serious

220
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:50,027
他从没说起过他自己...Nathan
He never talks about himself. Nathan.

221
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:53,019
每次我问他什么的时候  他总是回避
Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.

222
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:56,033
不  如果他是他们中的一个  那为什么他还在这儿?
If he were one of them, why would he still be here?

223
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:59,092
我不知道  但我要找出答案
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

224
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:04,064
让我出去好么?  Ana
Will you let me out? Ana?

225
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:08,070
你有意见么?
You got a problem with this?

226
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,012
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

227
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:15,095
让我出去
Let me out!

228
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,039
孩子们在哪儿?
Where are the kids?

229
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:43,016
孩子们在哪儿?
Where are the kids?

230
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:50,057
你从哪儿来  Nathan?
 Where you from, Nathan?

231
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:52,037
加拿大
Canada.

232
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:54,031
你在澳大利亚干什么?
What were you doing in Australia?

233
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:55,060
我们整个驻军连返回美国
Company retreat.

234
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,031
-他们在哪儿?  -什么?
-Where are they?  -What?

235
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:59,011
你们连的其他弟兄  他们在哪儿?
The rest of your retreat. Where are they ?

236
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:01,015
他们不在飞机上
They weren't on the plane.

237
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:04,003
我自己多留了几天四处逛逛
I stayed extra days to sightsee.

238
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:06,007
为什么在飞机上没人见过你  Nathan?
How come nobody saw you on the plane?

239
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:08,095
-我在厕所里  -两小时?
-I was in the lavatory.  -For two hours?

240
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:11,015
我不记得在飞机上见过你
I don't remember seeing you.

241
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:14,080
那是因为你不在飞机上
That's because you weren't on it.

242
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:22,062
孩子们在哪儿  Nathan?
Where are the kids, Nathan?

243
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:29,059
孩子们在哪儿?
Where are the kids?

244
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:34,069
不再和我说话了么?
You're not talking to me anymore?

245
00:24:39,098 --> 00:24:43,044
你后面的是什么?
What's that behind you?

246
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:46,064
站起来
Get up.

247
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:51,092
我说了  "站起来"
I said, get up!

248
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:57,081
-是谁给他吃的?  -怎么了?
-Who gave him food?  -What?

249
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:01,013
我想知道他对我们做了什么  你是负责看守他的
I'm trying to find out what they did, and you're taking care of him.

250
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,079
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

251
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,051
如果是你错了呢  Ana?
And what if you're wrong, Ana?

252
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:06,096
我们甚至不知道是否真的有卧底
We don't even know that there is spy.

253
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:11,030
是谁说的让我们呆在海滩上好让他们一个个把我们带走的?
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one?

254
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,093
他说的  Nathan
His. Nathan's.

255
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,019
自从你把他囚在那儿后 他们再也没来过
Well, they haven't come since we put him in there.

256
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,035
是谁干的?
Who did it?

257
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:26,007
是你?
You?

258
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,015
我们很为你担心  Ana
I'm worried about you, Ana.

259
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:05,033
你关了他4天了
You've had him down there four days.

260
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:12,025
我向那个小女孩保证过我会把她带回她母亲身边的
I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.

261
00:26:18,065 --> 00:26:21,080
你有孩子么  Ana?
Do you have any kids, Ana?

262
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:27,091
没有
No.

263
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:39,014
我们得放了他
We should let him go.

264
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,087
我们不是野蛮人
We're not savages.

265
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:48,004
如果我是个野蛮人我早砍下他的手指了
If I were a savage I would have cut off his finger already.

266
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,083
明天我就打算这么干
That's tomorrow.

267
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:24,085
抓住绳子  我拉你上来
Grab the rope. I'll pull you up.

268
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,090
Ana Lucia  我想...
Ana Lucia's... I think...

269
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,093
我想我们都认为她会伤害你
We all think she's gonna hurt you.

270
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:42,093
现在你得离开这儿
You need to get away from here.

271
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:47,003
这儿有些水果  好了  马上走
There's some fruit in there, now just go.

272
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:48,070
海滩是哪个方向?
Which way's the beach?

273
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,017
往那儿走  大约5英里
That way, maybe five miles.

274
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:20,064
早上好
Morning.

275
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:26,071
早上好
Morning.

276
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:30,090
Ana Lucia!

277
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,096
-他逃了  -什么?
-He's gone!  -What?

278
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:36,072
他逃了  Nathan逃走了
He's gone! Nathan's gone!

279
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:43,065
Ana  你打算怎么办?
Ana, what are you gonna do?

280
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:47,041
他们找到我们了  是时候离开了
They found us, it's time to move.

281
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,070
那是什么?
What is it?

282
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,009
我不知道  像是一个碉堡
I don't know. Some sort of bunker.

283
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:36,070
你想这是他们的么?
Do you think it's theirs?

284
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:42,064
你干什么?
What are you doing?

285
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:11,069
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

286
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:16,010
像是储藏室什么的
Looks like some sort of storage facility.

287
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:30,005
嘿  来这儿看看
Hey, come over here.

288
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:41,021
那是什么?  拿去
What was that? Get it.

289
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:46,082
这儿还有什么?
What else is in here?

290
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:50,018
是玻璃假眼
It's a glass eye.

291
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,010
看看这个
Look at this.

292
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,050
是无线电
It's a radio.

293
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:26,013
喂?
Hello?

294
00:31:26,013 --> 00:31:29,094
喂?  有人么?
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

295
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,049
电波被山挡住了
The hills are blocking it.

296
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:35,085
要信号的话  我们得去高一点的地方
If we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground.

297
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:38,023
我去吧
I'll do it.

298
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,058
我和你一起去
I'll go with you.

299
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:42,026
不  你得呆在这儿  把这儿打点成一个庇护所
No, you stay here. Get this place set up as a shelter.

300
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,088
我们会的
We can all set it up.

301
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:49,060
我们几小时后就能回来  走吧
We can make it back in a couple of hours. Let's go.

302
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:57,007
你想他们为什么这么做?
Why do you think they're doing this?

303
00:31:57,007 --> 00:31:59,096
什么他们为什么这么做?
Why do I think who's doing what?

304
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:01,060
他们
Them.

305
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,030
你就没想过他们为什么要攻击我们么?
Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?

306
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:10,034
也许他们不是在攻击我们
Maybe they're not attacking us.

307
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:15,014
是啊  他们只是不时的把我们往丛林里拖
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then.

308
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:17,074
没有伤害我们
No real harm done.

309
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:20,066
说得好
Good point.

310
00:32:23,086 --> 00:32:29,002
你想他们为什么只带走了我们中的一些人而不是另一些人?
Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?

311
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:31,058
你知道  第一晚  他们带走了我们中最强壮的
That first night they took the strongest of us,

312
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:35,062
你那沉默的朋友 还有另外3个人
our quiet friend, three other guys.

313
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:38,024
他们都是运动能手
They're all athletic...

314
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:41,008
强壮...
tough...

315
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:43,007
有威胁
threats.

316
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:47,015
但他们没带走你
They didn't take you.

317
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:54,005
我想在死了两个人后他们改变主意了
Guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed.

318
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,009
要休息一下么?
Wanna take a break?

319
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,052
好主意
Yeah, that's a good idea.

320
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:19,077
借刀用一下好么?
Can I have the knife?

321
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,023
谢谢
Thank you.

322
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,007
你想他们这把刀是怎么来的?
Where do you think they got it?

323
00:33:48,007 --> 00:33:51,012
我是说  他们甚至连鞋子都没有
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.

324
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:54,032
他们怎么会有军刀的?
How did they get an army knife?

325
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,099
什么?
Sorry?

326
00:33:55,099 --> 00:34:00,082
那把刀  是美军的军刀
The knife. It's US military.

327
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:06,049
拿来
Here...

328
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:10,000
我指给你看
I'll show you.

329
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,064
看到这个标志了么?
You see the tang stamp?

330
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:19,061
这把刀可能有20年的历史了
This knife's probably 20 years old.

331
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:21,083
现在是见不到了
You don't see these anymore.

332
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:27,043
但在这个岛上却有一把
Yet, here it is, on this island.

333
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:30,029
很奇怪  不是么?
Weird, huh?

334
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:36,052
我能问你点问题么?
Can I ask you something?

335
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:38,093
当然  Ana
Sure, Ana.

336
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:44,045
坠机那天你从丛林里跑出来
When you ran out of the jungle, the day of the crash...

337
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:50,014
你是怎么...你是怎么发现树上的Bernard的?
...how did you find Bernard up in the tree?

338
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:55,009
我在海滩上听见他喊救命了
I heard him shouting from the beach.

339
00:34:55,022 --> 00:34:59,002
在海滩上?
From the beach?

340
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:04,082
你为什么这么问  Ana?
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?

341
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:10,079
他在那儿看到你了么?
Did he see you out there?

342
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,003
这就是为什么你要假装你是我们中的一员?
Is that why you pretended to be one of us?

343
00:35:19,008 --> 00:35:26,085
你在坠机后10分钟从丛林里跑出来全身都是干的
You ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash. You weren't wet.

344
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:33,054
你不是从水里上来的
You were never even in the ocean.

345
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:44,013
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?

346
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:47,019
你的朋友
Your friends?

347
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:53,003
Nathan  你为什么...
Nathan... what did you...

348
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:56,046
即使你砍了他的手指  他还是会说他是飞机上的
If you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane,

349
00:35:56,046 --> 00:36:01,097
我想你也许会认为弄错人了
I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.

350
00:36:02,013 --> 00:36:04,010
你杀了他?
Did you kill him?

351
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:08,070
Nathan不是个好人
Nathan was not a good person.

352
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:13,056
这就是为什么他的名字不在名单上
That's why he wasn't on the list.

353
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:23,068
孩子们呢?你也杀了他们?
What about the kids? Did you kill them, too?

354
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:28,009
孩子们很好
The children are fine.

355
00:36:29,057 --> 00:36:33,028
他们现在境况很好
They're better off now.

356
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:20,080
Goodwin呢?
Where's Goodwin?

357
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,004
现在这儿安全了
We're safe here now.

358
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:54,004
你为什么还在那东西上浪费时间? 这儿没信号
Why are you wasting time with that thing? There's no signal.

359
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:58,026
我一天只开一会
I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.

360
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,001
-这真的很不...  -喂
-It really doesn't...  -Hello?

361
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:05,018
喂?  那儿有人么?  求救求救
Hello? Anybody out there? Mayday! Mayday!

362
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:09,044
-有人么?  -喂?  喂?
-Is there someone there?  -Hello! Hello!

363
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:12,011
-那是谁?  -能听见我说话么?
-Who is that?  -Can you hear me?

364
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:14,003
请你再说一遍
Repeat your transmission.

365
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:19,031
喂  我们是大洋航空815航班的幸存者 请回答
Hello! We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815, please copy!

366
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:22,045
我们是815航班的幸存者
We're the survivors of flight 815!

367
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:24,002
不  等等  你干什么?
No, wait a minute, what are you doing?

368
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,096
是他们
It's them.

369
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,031
是他们
It's them.

370
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:36,022
他们想引蛇出洞  他们想找到我们
They're trying to draw us out. They’re trying to find us.

371
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,049
不  他说了"815" 他说了"815航班"
No, he said "flight 815".

372
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:43,084
他们知道我们的航班号是因为Goodwin也知道
They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.

373
00:38:44,013 --> 00:38:46,041
但是如果那儿真的有幸存者呢?
What if there are survivors out there?

374
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:50,008
没有幸存者了
There are no survivors.

375
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,041
现在是我们的生活了
This is our life now.

376
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,081
要学着适应适应了
Get used to it.

377
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:52,023
你看什么?
What are you looking at?

378
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:59,079
会没事的
It's going to be OK.

379
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:20,074
什么  你现在说话了?
What, you're talking now?

380
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:24,085
已经40天了
It's been 40 days.

381
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:37,030
你等了40天才说话?
You been waiting 40 days to talk?

382
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:42,042
你等了40天才哭
You waited 40 days to cry.

383
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,033
Libby.

384
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:41,013
把他翻过来
Turn him over.

385
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:43,094
他还活着么?
Is he alive?

386
00:41:47,013 --> 00:41:50,098
去叫Ana Lucia  快
Get Ana Lucia! Quick!

387
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:04,018
你是谁?
Who are you?

388
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:09,088
你从哪儿来?
Where are you from?

389
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:20,084
-他不懂英语  -这不代表什么
-He doesn't speak English.  -That doesn't mean anything.

390
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:22,055
我们是在水里找到他的
We found him in the water.

391
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:27,026
他手腕上有个破手铐
He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.

392
00:42:27,075 --> 00:42:31,099
我不确定他是否是个危险人物
I'm not sure that he's a threat.

393
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,070
他跑了
He's running!

394
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:42,002
Michael! Sawyer!  -Jin!

395
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:49,019
来人啊 来人啊   来人啊   来人啊  来人啊 
Others! Others! Others! Others! Others...

396
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:51,083
来人啊 
Others...

397
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:13,024
-打我  -打你?
-Hit me.  -Hit you?

398
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:16,033
你觉得他们没问题?
You think they're OK?

399
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:18,034
我们去找答案吧
Let's find out.

400
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:21,028
打我吧
Hit me.

401
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:35,099
-Cindy  Cindy在哪儿?  -被他们带走了?
-Cindy? Where's Cindy?  -Did they take her?

402
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,051
Cindy
Cindy!

403
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:03,080

What was that?

404
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:21,010
