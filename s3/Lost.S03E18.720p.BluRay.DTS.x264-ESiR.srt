I'm still not used to "Mrs.Kwon."

不过我把床都准备好了
But I got the bed set up.

47

63
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,007

- oh,my god! - Oh,it's a branch!

93
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:24,068
一定是落下来的时候,不小心撞到的
She must have hit it on the way down.

94
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:28,014
把她的背包拿来,急救箱里的东西快用完了
Uh,get her pack.We haven't got much in this first aid kit.

- She could be our way off the island.- No,if we move her,it'll make it worse.

102
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,069
我们就眼看着她流血致死吗?

从那里走来单程也要8小时!

那我跑去
Then I'll run.

106
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:55,086
你疯了吗? 这很危险
You're out of your mind.It's not safe.

107
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:58,069
天黑了  鬼知道丛林里有什么? 不要忘了...
It's gonna be dark soon.Who knows who's out in this jungle? In case you have forgotten,

108
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,054
这岛上还有人才辈出想杀了我们

115
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:56,009
你介意我把这个放在桌子上吗?
Do you mind if I put this on the table?

116
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,087
当然不
Not at all.

117
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,075
就算穿了这身衣服...
Even in a cap and gown...

118
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:10,045
你还是我见过最性感的女人

你没有自己家人的照片吗?
Don't you have and pictures of your family?

120
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:23,079
我长大的时候...

121
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,049
连台相机都没有
...camera growing up.

122
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,021
一张都没有吗?
No pictures at all?

123
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:29,025
那...
Well...

124
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:33,073
你父亲就没留给你些吗?
...didn't your father leave you any?

125
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:37,077
没有  我参军时父亲就去世了
No, I was in the army when he died.

126
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:41,095
参军?  你说你父亲去世时你才16岁
The army? You said your father died when you were sixteen.

127
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:44,077
不  是在我参军时
No.I was in the army.

128
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,013
但你告诉我...
But you told me --

129
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:49,033
你一定是弄错了
You must've misunderstood.

130
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:53,008
你问这个干嘛Sun?
What is this about,Sun?

131
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,069
这...
It's...

132
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:59,000
没什么  我很抱歉
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

133
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,064
汤快凉了
Your soup is getting cold.

134
00:08:09,044 --> 00:08:11,024
这样好吗?

135
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,012

Jack和"the others"在一起的时候发生了什么?
What do you think happened to jack while he was with the others?

138

他好像有点变了
Since he's been back,he seems different.

139
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:33,083
他说他也就是个囚犯
He says that he was pretty much a prisoner,and

140
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:39,023
他和他们合作的唯一原因就是他认为他们能让他离开这里
the only reason why he cooperated is 'cause he thought they'd let him off the island.

141
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:42,040
你真的相信他吗?
Do you believe him?

142
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:46,020
为什么不呢?
Why wouldn't I?

143
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:50,064
他问我怀孕的事
He came to me,asking about my pregnancy.

144
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:51,097
那这也不能和...
Well,what would that have anything to do--

145
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,003
如果...
what if...

146
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:57,006
"the others"想要我的孩子呢?
what if the others want my baby?

147
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,050
他在那儿已经一个星期了
He's beethere alone for over a week.

148
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,086
也许他在为他们做事
How do we know he isn't working with them?

149
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:09,076
他才不会这么做
He's not working with them.

150
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:14,030
你知道些什么吗Kate?
Do you know something,kate?

151
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:24,004
是Juliet
It's juliet.

152
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,063
她是他们的医生...他们的...
She was their doctor-- their--

153
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:29,001
妇产科医生  专门研究这里的孕妇...
their fertility doctor,studyi pregnant women,and

154
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,076
当Claire病的时候 她告诉我和Jack...

155
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:35,066
"the others"要孩子的原因...

156
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:39,044
是为了做研究

157
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,069
Sun!
Sun!

158
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,004
-等等  你不必这么做的  -这与你无关Kate
- Wait.You don't have to do this.- Go away,kate.

159
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,088
我想了解一下你的研究
I want to know about your research.

160
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,088
Sun...
Sun...

161
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:58,060
孕妇会怎么样?
what happens to pregnant women?

162
00:09:58,061 --> 00:10:00,098
你怀孕了?
You're pregnant.

163
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,028
你肯定吗?你是怎么知道的?
Are you sure? How do you know?

164
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,089
我问你问题呢!
I asked you a question.

165
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,092
大家不在乎你在这里洗衣服吃东西
Everyone else might be all right with you washing your clothes and eating our food,

166
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:11,045
但我想知道到底发生了什么?
but I want to know what's going on.

167
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:14,048
我要答案
I want answers.

168
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:19,034
你们那些人在干什么? 为什么要带走孩子?
What are you people doing? Why are you taking children?

169
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:24,043
孕妇在这座岛上会怎么样?
What happens to pregnant women on this island?

170
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:27,098
-到底会...  -他们会死
- What happens--  - they die.

171
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:32,028
他们都会死
They all die.

172
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,099
Sun我们走吧
sun,come on.Let's go.

173
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:47,013
她在说什么?
what is she saying?

174
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,043
汉语...不是韩语
Chinese...  not korean.

175
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:51,033
也许我们该把它拔出来
Maybe we should just pull it out.

176
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,071
-那会更糟.-你忘了这里有多危险吗?
 Noyou'll just make it worse.- Have you forgotten what's at stake here?

177
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:56,026
难道这又是你的预感? 这次是谁的脖子中箭了?
Or is this just another one of your flashes? Who's getting an arrow in the neck this time?

178
00:10:56,026 --> 00:11:00,074
难道你忘了吗 她叫了我的名字!
lest you forget,she said my bloody name!

179
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:04,036
她还有我和女友的照片
She had a photo of me and my girlfriend.

180
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:06,049
我知道什么? 我知道的比你们多的多!
Do I understand? I understand better than the lot of you!

181
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,059
伙计们  冷静一点
Hey,guys,chill.

182
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:11,053
我们已经浪费了很多时间
We've wasted enough time already.

183
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,002
你不能离开这里
Hey,you're not leaving us.

184
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:16,025
-请让开Charlie   -不!
- Just get out of my way,charlie.- No!

185
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,050
Jin!
Jin!

186
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,067
-Jin! 
-Jin!

187
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:39,021
你是谁?
who are you?

188
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:42,081
我问你,你是谁?
I said,who are you?

189
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,088
就是他射伤了Sayid
He's the guy who shot sayid.

190
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,070
Kate告诉我们的,Locke把他住的那个站给炸飞了
Kate told us.He lived out in that station that locke blew up.

191
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:50,061
他是他们的人
He's an other.

192
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:54,071
我以为Locke已经用电磁防御系统杀了他了
I thought locke killed that guy with the electro-fence thingy.

193
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:59,093
你只有5秒钟,否则我就开枪了
You've got five seconds to talk,or I fire this gun,brother.

194
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:03,090
-这是信号枪-你应该知道...
- That's a flare gun.- And how do you think it'll feel...

195
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:08,005
在这个距离被信号枪射中心脏的滋味吧?
taking a flare to the chest at this range?

196
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:12,078
你朋友已经说过了,我这周已经死过一次了
As your friend pointed out,I already died once this week.

197
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:19,006
(意大利语...)

198
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,063
你能听懂她
You understand her.

199
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:22,033
她说的是意大利语
She's speaking italian.

200
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:26,022
她说她快不行了.她需要帮助
She said she's dying. She needs help.

201
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:31,046
我曾是苏联军队里的军医.我能帮助你们
I was a soviet army field medic.I can offer you my services.

202
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:35,038
-等等  你在干嘛?  -救她的命
- Wait.What are you doing?- I'm saving her.

203
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,088
树枝刺穿了她的肺
This branch has punctured her lung.

204
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,069
里面进了血
It's filling with blood.

205
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:51,015
如果不能吸入空气,她会死的
If it is not ventilated soon,she's going to die.

206
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:55,023
好吧  你干吧  帮帮她
Well,do it. Help her.

207
00:13:55,023 --> 00:14:01,009
如果我救了她.你们得让我走
If I fix her,you must let me walk away as if I never came upon you.

208
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,029
你还需要什么?
What do you need?

209
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,009
不好意思  你是Kwon先生吗?
Excuse me. Are you Mr.Kwon?

210
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:09,085
是啊
Yes.

211
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:14,063
你一定是Sun
You must be Sun.

212
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,082
谢谢
Thank you.

213
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:33,025
和我说说你们的婚礼
Please.Tell me about your wedding.

214
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:35,065
那很美
It was beautiful.

215
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:38,028
那是我生命中最快乐的一天
The happiest day of my life.

216
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:42,080
我想我儿子也是
And my son's,too,I imagine.

217
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:45,074
Kwon先生
Mr.Kwon.

218
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:49,087
你怎么没有参加婚礼?
Why weren't you at the wedding?

219
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:53,060
他告诉你什么了?
What did he tell you?

220
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:56,074
他告诉我...
He told me...

221
00:15:56,084 --> 00:16:00,019
你已经去世了
You were dead.

222
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:05,099
他为什么要这么说?
Why would he say that?

223
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,054
为了不让大家知道他家庭的耻辱
To avoid the shame of where he came from.

224
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:20,042
这就是你为什么要告诉他...
And is that why you told him...

225
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:24,032
他母亲在他还是婴儿时就去世了?
...his mother died when he was a baby?

226
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,091
他的母亲...
His mother...

227
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:40,071
和很多男人好过
She was with many men.

228
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:44,005
她把孩子留给了我
She left me with the baby.

229
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:47,036
我独自把他抚养大
I raised him alone.

230
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:51,047
我甚至都不确定他是我的孩子
I wasn't even sure I was the father.

231
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:57,039
但还有谁会肯照顾他呢?
But who else would take care of him?

232
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:15,035
你很美
You are so beautiful.

233
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:20,079
和荣幸见到你
It pleases me so much to meet you.

234
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:25,099
不要和他说你来见过我...
You can never tell him that you met me...

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,021
还有他母亲还活着
...or that this mother is still alive.

236
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:31,078
求你了...
Please...

237
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,040
就为了我
...for me.

238
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,005
别...
Do not...

239
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:41,098
别让他为了这耻辱而受苦
Do not make him suffer this shame.

240
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:03,014
别出声
be quiet.

241
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:05,084
别动
be quiet.

242
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,047
你想我帮你和你的孩子吗?
You want me to help you and your baby?

243
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:11,037
我已经回答过你了,现在你必须跟我来
I have answers to your questions,but you ha to come with me right now.

244
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:15,066
就你和我
Just you and me,nobody else.

245
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:25,048
如果你说的是实话,那我早就死了
if what you said was true,that means I'm already dead.

246
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,002
我干嘛还要跟你去?
Why should I go anywhere with you?

247
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:31,016
因为你还是有希望的
Because there may be hope for you yet.

248
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:56,080
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

249
00:18:56,081 --> 00:19:00,049
这附近有个医疗站,那里有超声波仪器
There's a medical station near here.They have an ultrasound machine

250
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,094
Claire和Kate告诉过我那个地方
Claire and kate told me about that place.

251
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:06,056
那里已经被遗弃了.什么都找不到
It was abandoned.They found nothing there.

252
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:10,012
那是因为他们不知道要找哪里
Well,that's because they didn't know where to look.

253
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:13,041
你要对我做什么?
What are you going to do to me?

254
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,065
我要检查你肚子里的孩子D.O.C...
I'm gonna look at your baby and determine the D.O.C.--

255
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:21,000
怀孕的日期
Um,date of conception.

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,051
超声波仪器会告诉我们你是几时怀孕的  误差在1天内
The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant,give or take a day.

257
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:29,083
如果你是在岛外怀孕的,那你和你的孩子就会没事的
If you got pregnant off the island,then you and your baby will probably be okay,

258
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:33,043
但如果你是在这里怀孕的...
but if you got pregnant here...

259
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:38,069
到时候再想办法吧
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

260
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,086
你和你丈夫最近一次做爱是什么时候?
When was the last time you and your husband had sex?

261
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,042
我情愿不回答你的问题
I would rather not talk about that.

262
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:46,081
我知道这是隐私  但如果我知道是什么时候  我可以...
Look,I know that it's personal,but if I know when,then I can figure--

263
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:49,062
那个机器不是能告诉我们吗?
isn't that what the machine will do?

264
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,098
当然
Yeah.

265
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:55,097
那我们继续走吧
Then let's keep walking.

266
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:29,067
Paik先生
Mr.Paik.

267
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:31,015
你女儿想要见你
Your daughter is here to see you.

268
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:32,060
新婚快乐
Congratulations on your wedding.

269
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,082
谢谢
Thank you.

270
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:36,091
祝你们幸福
We wish you much happiness.

271
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:44,001
你怎么来了?
To what do I owe this visit?

272
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:47,027
我想让你帮个忙
I need to ask you a favor.

273
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:51,000
怎么了  亲爱的?
What is it,my dear?

274
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,086
我...我需要...
I... I need...

275
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:02,073
10万美元
One hundred thousand dollars.

276
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:05,009
为了什么?
What for?

277
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,089
我不能告诉你
I can't tell you.

278
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,027
你不给我一个解释,我怎么能给你钱?
Why should I give you money without an explanation?

279
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:16,093
因为我一生...
Because my whole life...

280
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:20,032
都假装不知道你在做什么
...I've pretended not to know what you do.

281
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:23,096
一直好好的听从你
I've allowed you to keep your control over me.

282
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:28,013
我假装一切都很好
I pretend that everything is all right.

283
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:31,096
我会继续这样装下去
I will continue pretending.

284
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:37,025
只要你给我这笔钱
As long as you give me the money I am asking for.

285
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:40,023
别问我理由
No questions asked.

286
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:47,045
这世界上人人都有发问的权力!
We do not live in a world where there are no questions asked!

287
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:52,050
我这么做是为了让我深爱的人远离耻辱
I'm doing this to spare someone I love deep shame.

288
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:57,033
你的丈夫?
Your new husband?

289
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,075
如果这钱是为了你的丈夫...
If the money is for your husband...

290
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:29,002
那就该他来还这笔债
It is he who will bear this debt.

291
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:31,005
他不再是部门经理了
He will no longer be a floor manager.

292
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:34,083
他将为我工作
He will be working for me.

293
00:22:58,054 --> 00:23:00,047
你们对这个女人还了解多少?
what else do you know about this woman?

294
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:02,094
除了信号枪她还有什么?
Did she have anything on her besides the flare gun?

295
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:07,077
一本书  还有个无线电,电话什么的...
Just a book,a fancy radio/phone thingy...

296
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:10,070
它好使吗?
does it work?

297
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:13,042
好使的话我早告诉你了
Like I'd tell you.

298
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:15,001
需要一个人帮忙
One of you must help.

299
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:17,074
其他人给我留出空间
The rest,clear the way.I need space.

300
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:20,065
我来做
I'll do it.

301
00:23:21,012 --> 00:23:24,047
尽可能的帮她擦血
Wipe away as much of the blood as you can.

302
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:27,023
需要把空气排出来!
need to evacuate the air now!

303
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:29,058
把她按住了
Hold her steady.

304
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,050
稳住!
Steady!

305
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:33,037
我知道了
Yeah,I-I heard you.

306
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,085
这样...正常吗?
is that... normal?

307
00:23:45,094 --> 00:23:48,077
纱布
gauze.

308
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:53,038
小心的包扎起来
Tape it. Be careful.

309
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,074
不要太紧了
The covering needs to be hollow.

310
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:59,004
伤口需要透气
The wound needs to breathe.

311
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,040
她说了什么?
what did she say?

312
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,049
"谢谢"
"Thank you."

313
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,080
她说"谢谢你们救了我"
She said,"thank you for helping me."

314
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:26,064
就在这下面
It's right down here.

315
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,020
你为什么要这么做?
why are you doing this?

316
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:27,027
什么?
What?

317
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:30,075
帮助我
Helping me.

318
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:41,058
从前...
Once upon a time,

319
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:45,051
我告诉别人他们怀孕时
I told women that they were pregnant,

320
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:48,036
他们的表情告诉我...
and their faces...

321
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:55,096
这是他们一生中听到最好的消息
it was the best news they ever got in their entire life.

322
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:59,010
然而我到了这里
Then I came here.

323
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:06,081
在过去的3年里...
in the last three years.

324
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:10,048
我们失去了9位病人
I've lost...nine patients...

325
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,002
我帮助你是因为我想告诉你...
I'm helping you because I want to tell you

326
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:20,075
你是在来这之前怀孕的
that you and your husband got pregnant before you came here.

327
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:28,010
我帮助你是因为我想告诉你好的消息
I'm helping you because I want to give good news again.

328
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:36,085
我和其他男人上床了...
I slept with another man...

329
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:43,039
在来这里之前
Before we got to the island.

330
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:49,021
Jin和我...
Jin and I,we were having...

331
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:54,041
遇到了些麻烦,我们没有...
trouble.We weren'T...

332
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,046
我有一个朋友
and I had a friend.

333
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:10,012
那是个错误
It was a mistake.

334
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:14,055
我们都会犯错
We all make mistakes.

335
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:20,063
哪边走?
Which way?

336
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:56,078
能帮我挪一下吗?
will you help me move this forward?

337
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,090
好了
good.

338
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:32,082
为什么这个房间被隐藏起来了?
why is this room hidden?

339
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,027
别担心
Don't worry about it.

340
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:38,068
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

341
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:42,018
告诉我
Tell me.

342
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:47,059
我们把要死的女人都带来这里
It's where we brought the women to die.

343
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:54,055
她没事
She's fine.

344
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:57,083
尽量保持伤口的清洁
Keep the wound as clean as you can.

345
00:28:57,084 --> 00:29:00,037
一天后她会好起来的
She should be better in a day.

346
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,060
一天?
A day?

347
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:03,091
她的肺被刺穿了
Her lung was punctured.

348
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:07,070
这座岛上的  自然规律有些不同
On this island,the rules are a bit different.

349
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:11,029
也许一天半
Maybe a day and a half.

350
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,085
我做了该做的
I did as I promised.

351
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:18,050
她会活下来的
She will live.

352
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:23,009
-你不会真的放他走吧    -你走吧
- You can't seriously be considering letting him go. - Just go.

353
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,083
开什么玩笑?.他是他们的人!
Are you kidding?He's one of them!

354
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:27,011
我又能怎么做Charlie?
So what would you have me do,charlie?

355
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:28,098
我们得做个担架来抬她走
We've t to make a stretcher and carry her.

356
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,047
你想让我再带上个囚犯吗?
How are we gonna do that and bring a prisoner?

357
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:33,017
-给我根绳子  -责任由我来负
- Give me some rope. - I'll take responsibility.

358
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:35,064
电话  电话!
Phone. Phone!

359
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,032
-Jin等等!  -电话!
- Wait,jin! - Phone!

360
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,011
-没关系的Jin! 
-不  让他去吧!

361
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:42,032
-快回来Jin!    -让他去追吧!
- Jin,come back here! - Oi,let him!

362
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:44,076
-没关系的Jin! Jin! -电话!
- Jin,it's all right! -  no,let him!

363
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:46,013
Jin让他走吧
Jin,let him go!

364
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:47,058
Jin让他走吧!
Jin,let him go!

365
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,084
电话!
Phone!

366
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:58,018
是你偷走的?
You stole this?

367
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:00,069
不试试怎么知道?
How could you respect me if I didn't try?

368
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,036
要不要弄瞎你另一只眼睛?
How about I take your other eye?

369
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:04,028
你会试试吗?
Would you respect that?

370
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:05,099
抱歉  我...
Sorry. I--

371
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,077
住手Charlie!
charlie,don't!

372
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:08,057
Charlie!
Charlie!

373
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,079
Charlie让他走吧!
Charlie,let him go!

374
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,097
这是一个错误!
This is a mistake!

375
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:12,040
我们不能就这么放了他!
We can't keep letting these people go!

376
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:15,043
我保证过他!
We gave him our word!

377
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:25,074
走吧
Go on.

378
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:28,089
滚远点
Get out of here.

379
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:53,031
这不是Jin的孩子
the baby isn't jin'S.

380
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:59,027
我们在韩国试着生孩子,但我们不能
We tried to have a baby back in korea and couldn'T.

381
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:02,052
医生告诉我...
And the doctor...

382
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,069
Jin他不能生育
he told me jin was infertile.

383
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,058
然后你来了这里
And then you came here.

384
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,008
什么?
What?

385
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:16,041
你知道男人精子的平均数量是...
Did you know that the average male sperm count is

386
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:19,090
6到8千万?
between 60 and 80 million?

387
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:24,027
不过在这座岛上是那的5倍之多
But on this island,it's five times that.

388
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:28,018
这样的几率很高
We call that good odds.

389
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:31,071
准备好了吗?
you ready?

390
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:33,008
是的
Yes.

391
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:36,071
把你的上衣撩起来一点
Okay,you wanna lift up your shirt a little?

392
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:39,093
会有些凉
It's cold.

393
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,009
我能看见我的孩子吗?
will I see the baby?

394
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,015
也许吧
Maybe.

395
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:47,025
你只有3个月,所以还不能确定
It's your first trimester,so it's a little iffy.

396
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:49,065
如果你看不见心跳
if you don't see a heartbeat,

397
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:54,001
别担心  因为现在还早
don't worry about it.It's just early.

398
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:56,013
这是怎么工作的?
How does it work?

399
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,052
我测量一下胎儿
Well,I take a measurement

400
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:00,043
这就能告诉我
of the fetus,and that will tell us

401
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,090
你是什么时候受孕的
when your baby was conceived

402
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:07,043
我们就可以知道是谁的孩子了
and then we'll know who.

403
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:13,003
你还好吗?
are you okay?

404
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,002
我得到的都会是坏消息
I lose either way.

405
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:20,021
如果我能活下来...
If I'm going to live...

406
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:24,051
那就意味着这不是Jin的孩子
that means the baby's not jin'S.

407
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:28,019
你还想继续吗?
Do you still want to do this?

408
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:33,022
-是的-好吧
- Yes.- Okay.

409
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:36,086
真相的时刻
Moment of truth.

410
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:51,051
Kwon夫人
Mrs.Kwon

411
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:57,067
Kwon先生
Mr.Kwon

412
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:04,063
我听说你今天来过办公室
I heard you came by the office today.

413
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:07,077
怎么不来打个招呼?
Why didn't you come say hello?

414
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:10,041
我不想打扰你
I didn't want to bother you.

415
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:14,058
能见到你,永远都不会
Seeing you is never a bother.

416
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:18,050
下一次  我一定会来
Next time,i promise.

417
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:20,027
你去拿过信了吗?
Did you get the mail?

418
00:33:20,028 --> 00:33:22,025
抱歉  我给忘了
Sorry,i forgot.

419
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:23,094
信箱钥匙在你那儿吗?
Do you have the mail key?

420
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:27,055
在我包里
It's in my purse.

421
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:33,020
Jin等等!
Jin!Wait!

422
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:39,089
这些钱是干什么的?
What's this money?

423
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,089
是...我父亲的
It's...from my father.

424
00:33:45,012 --> 00:33:47,088
为什么?
Why?

425
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:51,013
我想为我们买些家具....

那是你的孩子,你看见了吗?

我看见了

是男孩还是女孩?

442
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,008
这还为时过早
Oh,it's--it's a little early,

443
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:44,023
你看到这轻微的振动了吗?

那是心跳

很强烈的心跳,胎儿很健康

447
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:05,060
你们的飞机是90天前坠毁的

448
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:09,010
孩子大概是在8周前受孕的

449
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:14,032
所以...是53天左右

你是在这座岛上受孕的

还以为你不会来了

455
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:26,019
你为什么不告诉我你是Jin的母亲?
Why didn't you tell me you were Jin's mother?

456
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:31,088
我把他生了下来,那也不能说我就是他的母亲
I gave birth to him.But hat doest not make me his mother.

457
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:37,055
你知道我们家族的权势有多大

我丈夫以为你已经死了

我还剩多少时间?

Most of the women made it into the middle of their second trimester.

462
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:32,015
没人能撑过第三阶段(9个月)
Nobody made it to their third.

463
00:38:32,016 --> 00:38:36,077
那就是2个月

我...很高兴孩子是Jin的

我可不想留下任何痕迹
I don't wanna take the chance that we didn't cover our tracks.

469

477
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:10,094
我还在收集其他女人的样本

应该很快能得到Austen的

481
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:34,064

- You can't trust 'em,you know.- What's that?

482

"The others"你放跑那个

明天他会带着他的兄弟回来的

不能因为他们中的一个人
You know,just 'cause one comes traipsing back

和Jack  Kate一起回来了,就该相信他们
