1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,050
National news network  How may I direct your call?

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,070
There will be an explosion this morning

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,650
Excuse me?

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,010
I said,

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,450
"there will be an explosion this morning" A bomb

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,820
Oh,Sorry.Did you say A bomb,sir?

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,220
-sir?
-On a bus

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,610
in the city where it all began

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,390
Get my message out

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,950
Message?

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,490
What message?

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,430
That this is only the beginning

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,040
Until it is brought back under control,

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,550
SEATTLE,WASHINGTON

15
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,260
people will die

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,540
Hey! Mornin',JJ How was your

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,030
weekend?

18
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,210
Yeah?

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,570
Homeland security just reported a bomb threat for an unspecified urban area

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,180
It was phoned into the national news network

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,840
I'll call you back

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,510
When?

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,620
Last half hour

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,950
They need a threat assessment asap

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,700
-Get the team together
-Yeah

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,250
Sorry

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,570
Did you say a bomb,sir?

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,400
On a bus in the city where it all began

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,040
Get my message out

30
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,320
Message?

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,610
What message?

32
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,840
That this is only the beginning

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,390
Until it is brought back under control,

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,250
people will die

35
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,200
In the last 20 minutes,

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,940
virtually identical threats have been made to most of the coast-to-coast news networks in the country

37
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,110
It's the same information just slightly different words

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,230
So it's not a recorded message or script

39
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,060
Displays a measure of confidence

40
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,110
He could have easily just called one network

41
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,910
This guy obviously wants attention

42
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,570
It's typical behavior for a personal cause bomber

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,650
One bomb has a finite impact--

44
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,570
it's just a little package

45
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,940
Make bunch of phone calls,that magnifies my explosion 100 times

46
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,140
We have the additional recorded calls being gathered for assessment

47
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,790
Networks say the calls came from a restricted number

48
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,160
2 have given limited permission to trap and trace the lines if we should need to

49
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,220
You got a news organization to agree to a trap and trace?

50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
Who could say "no" to me?

51
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,170
This is not likely al-qaeda.They don't call unless they bomb something

52
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,150
At homeland security's request,

53
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,080
the networks are going to keep this quite until we've assessed the situation

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,550
It doesn't feel like a hoax

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,040
His voice is calm,resigned

56
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,050
He's made his decision.He's committed to it

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,190
Plus he said,

58
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,760
"this is only the beginning"

59
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,950
The beginning of what?And he also said,

60
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,500
"until it is brought back under control" what's it?

61
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,500
He has to call back

62
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,240
And if this threat isn't followed by an event,

63
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,370
no one will take any future calls seriously

64
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,530
So,

65
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,380
we're going to tell the media to go ahead with the story?

66
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,650
Absolutely not

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,450
Threats like this with an unspecified location will just cause tremendous panic

68
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,790
Then

69
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,110
what are we gonna do?

70
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,780
Unfortunately,all we can do is wait

71
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,230
Seattle
WASHINGTON

72
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,810
Robespierre once wrote,

73
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,520
"crime butchers innocents to secure a prize

74
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,160
And innocence struggles with all its might

75
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,790
against the attempts of crime"

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,850
So seattle's where it all began

77
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,570
We just need to figure out what it is

78
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,520
And off the top of my head,

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,860
I can think of grunge music and overpriced coffee

80
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,980
That doesn't seem significant enough for terrorism

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,560
It's a personal cause bomber

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,690
It only needs to be of significance to him

83
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,610
Agent nick casey,seattle field office

84
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,260
S.S.A.Hotchner How do you do?

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,190
This is dr.Spencer reid,

86
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,150
S.S.A.Morgan,

87
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,100
agent jareau,and S.S.A.Gideon

88
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,300
Have you identified the device?

89
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,650
Looks like a small pipe bomb attached to an umbrella

90
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,030
I'd like to take a look at those bomb fragments as soon as possible

91
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,380
I've got bomb squad experience

92
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,440
As soon as they're catalogued

93
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,240
How many people were on the bus when the explosion went off?

94
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,900
25 including the driver

95
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,900
Explosion killed 2--

96
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,410
the driver and a young male

97
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,630
Injured 7

98
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,310
A pipe bomb on a crowded city bus and only 2 people are killed?

99
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,440
Had a relatively small charge

100
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,780
The 2 dead were found closest to the bomb at the time of detonation

101
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,030
Sylvia cohen,an elderly passenger,

102
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,870
found the umbrella on the floor at her feet

103
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,660
She said the young man volunteered to take it to the driver for her

104
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,730
She's pretty broken up about it

105
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,280
Have you vetted and debriefed the rest of the passengers?

106
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,140
I have their info if you want to talk to them

107
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,400
Did you get their positions?

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,210
Sorry?

109
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,370
Where they were on the bus?

110
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,280
No

111
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,180
JJ,Maybe you can recontact the passengers and map their locations

112
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,430
Yeah,you got it

113
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,530
Nobody saw anyone leave the umbrella?

114
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,410
No

115
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,120
But,you know,from the style it looks like,uh,

116
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,710
remote detonator on the corner over there

117
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,700
You say remote?

118
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,170
Limited frequency remote

119
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,100
-Like a garage door opener?
-**************************

120
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,180
That's awfully risky

121
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,850
Anyone on this bus could have accidentally detonated the bomb just by pulling out of their garage

122
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,410
He used a remote from the corner

123
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,680
Did he want to be close enough to see what happened?

124
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,590
Or did he need to be mechanically?

125
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,310
Those remotes are pretty limited.He probably needed to be

126
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,870
Then he might have been nervous

127
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,290
Maybe that made him stand ouT

128
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,830
I could set up a public service announcement encouraging anyone

129
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,360
who was in the area of the time of the bombing to contact us

130
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,860
Well,we do need a press conference

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,500
But it'll be about getting this unsub to call us

132
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,330
We're still trying to determine what happened

133
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,240
Initial reports called it a bomb,

134
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,190
but since no one has claimed responsibility,

135
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,670
we can't rule out some kind of mechanical failure

136
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,780
Supervisory special agent gideon

137
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,480
will be handling any future communication on this incident

138
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,340
If anyone has any information they feel might be helpful,

139
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,780
please contact S.S.A.Gideon at the number appearing on your screen

140
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,910
We will keep you posted with future developments

141
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,310
Thank yoU

142
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,690
Think that was enough?

143
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,280
It will definitely stress him that his message isn't getting out

144
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,740
What if he doesn't call?

145
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,130
Reid and morgan are going over the device

146
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,540
Maybe they'll come up with something

147
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,440
You know,reid,

148
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,860
the bomber could have bought this detonator at any old toy store

149
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,270
You take a remote control car,

150
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,870
plane,boat,

151
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,180
attach a detonator like this to the motor,

152
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,970
touch the remote,

153
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,620
boom! Instant fourth of july

154
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,720
How you doing?

155
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,670
I'm derek morgan

156
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,800
This is dr.Spencer reid We're with the B.A.U.

157
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,890
Sondra atkins Cass or cassy works,too

158
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,350
Bomb tech

159
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,750
It's a really nice reconstruction

160
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,610
Oh,it wasn't that hard

161
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,870
Explosive was limited and the fragments were comparatively easy to locate

162
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,040
Ok So tell me what else you got here?

163
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,110
Well,besides the light explosive load,he used dry peas

164
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,650
Dry peas

165
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,870
He chose a shrapnel that wouldn't do too much damage outside of a limited range Why?

166
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,140
What's he doing,trying to minimize his kills?

167
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,870
It also has a picture enaved on it

168
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,580
Right there It's robot with an arrow through it

169
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,410
Anti-robotics?

170
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,280
Doesn't the city center bus stop use smart buses?

171
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,530
-Smart buses?
-Yeah

172
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,070
Hi-tech buses that use time sensors on the buses

173
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,820
and the bus stops to give out arrival and departure times?

174
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,570
Yeah Went automated last year

175
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,120
So he's anti-technology

176
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,970
Maybe

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,970
Hey,dollface,

178
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,420
ready to work some magic for me?

179
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,450
Challenge me,

180
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,590
you beautiful,behavioral analyst

181
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,120
Domestic terrorist activity in the seattle area

182
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,800
Ugh,morgan,I said challenge me

183
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,520
Doesn't even raise my blood pressure

184
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,850
Pacific northwest is,like,ripe with the disgruntled

185
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,270
You have animal rights,zoning laws

186
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,390
Specifically anti-technology?

187
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,540
Ahh,yes My looney opposites

188
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,400
Here's something!

189
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,220
Month ago Tacoma,washington--

190
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,070
disguised young guy went crazy on a bunch of computers at a science lab,

191
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,720
screaming,

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,670
"we will soon be the slaves and the machines will be the masters" Yikes

193
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,310
That would totally suck for me

194
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm surrounded in here

195
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,360
Come on,what are you worried about?

196
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,530
You got me to protect you

197
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,040
Ha! Now that gets my blood up

198
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,350
I'm uploading the video to you now

199
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,510
What else do you have,garcia?

200
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,140
I also found an article in the st

201
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,380
Dennis university college newspaper

202
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,960
Last spring,

203
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,660
close to the school,an internet cafe was attacked

204
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,130
campus internet cafe bombing attributed to fft brgade

205
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,770
No one was injured

206
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,520
Who uses floppy disks anymore?

207
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,920
Right,agent brain,that was the point of the attack

208
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,650
They left a note,

209
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,310
"ultimately,you'll be as obsolete as your graveyard technology"

210
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,590
Is the note signed?

211
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,330
"F.F.T.Brigade" I'm finding references to a freedom from technology brigade,

212
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,090
a fringe group that's showing up lately

213
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,770
Anything else in the note?

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,150
Yeah

215
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:08,390
There's A not very artistic drawing of what kind of looks like a robot with an arrow through it

216
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,260
I'm uploading it to you now

217
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,930
You know,seattle's the birthplace

218
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,250
of some of the most cutting edge technology in the world

219
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,640
Where it began

220
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,540
I think we're ready to give a profile

221
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,950
We believe the unsub resides in seattle

222
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,120
All of the attacks,most of which have just involved property damage,

223
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,830
have taken place here,

224
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,620
and the timing and location indicate knowledge of the area

225
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,010
Even though he escalated to a lethal bombing today,

226
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,660
we don't believe that that was necessarily his intention

227
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,980
In fact,anyone not directly next to the device received minor injuries

228
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,380
So we think fear may have been the larger motive

229
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,000
So he's a terrorist then

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,250
He is But

231
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,810
that's too vague of a description for our purposes

232
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,090
Douglas and olshaker categorize bombers as criminal,

233
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,290
group cause,psychologically disorganized,

234
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,240
and personal cause bombers

235
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,660
And we believe this guy to be a personal cause bomber

236
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,480
And personal cause bombers are motivated by an underlying emotional conflict

237
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,070
In an interview from prison,

238
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,450
the unabomber,ted kaczynksi,

239
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,690
admitted that while he was a graduate student at the university of michigan,

240
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,120
he started having fantasies of becoming a woman

241
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,480
Even got on a list to get a sex-change operation but,

242
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,930
during a mandatory psychological exam prior to the procedure,

243
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,600
he changed his mind

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,290
He told the psychologist that he made a mistake

245
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,380
From that moment through the next 3 decades of his life,

246
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,230
ted kaczynksi carried out a campaign of isolation and murder

247
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,800
This unsub is male

248
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,480
He lives alone

249
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,700
He's possibly self-employed

250
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,960
He's highly organized

251
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,040
He's meticulous

252
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,820
And he's very smart

253
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,830
And he seems odd to those who know him

254
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,400
Angry,distant,

255
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,360
prone to sudden violent rage

256
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,440
This is not the kind of guy whose neighbors will be surprised to find out what he's arrested for

257
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,680
This guy's neighbors will have no trouble believing it

258
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,140
Targets appear to be technology,but

259
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,930
not the hi-tech variety

260
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,960
The kind of technology we're surrounded by

261
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,340
In a city the size of seattle,we're talking 10,000 possible targets

262
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,850
Agent gideon,you got a call on the tip line

263
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,230
Ok,

264
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,260
go ahead

265
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,020
This is agent gideon

266
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,230
Why did you say no one took responsibility?!

267
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,820
I'm sorry

268
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,860
We called them all--

269
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,340
all the networks--

270
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,110
before anything happened

271
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,760
They didn't tell anyone?!

272
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,990
Well,the networks are incompetent

273
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,650
If you need to get your message out or you have a demand,

274
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,530
I'm in a much better position to do that for you

275
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,560
You have a name,sir?

276
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,950
We're the F.F.T. Brigade

277
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,340
No No No I mean you specifically What

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,940
what can I call ya?

279
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,500
This is not about individuals

280
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,950
F.F.T.'S a major organization--

281
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,260
we have hundreds of members

282
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,810
But you-- you have a name

283
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,400
You may call me allegro

284
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,530
So,allegro,let's meet somewhere

285
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,660
We can talk about your message,uh,

286
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,950
try to help you--

287
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,540
if the networks won't get our message out,

288
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,340
then it is up to you

289
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,720
It's your responsibility

290
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,890
So call this number

291
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,510
They'll put you through to me immediately

292
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,070
I won't need to call again

293
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,010
My message will be here when you arrive

294
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,720
I'm sorry,when I arrive?

295
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,060
What's that?

296
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,030
Allegro?

297
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,370
Hello?

298
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,850
Allegro?

299
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,530
Can you smell that?

300
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,700
Same explosive,just more of it

301
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,790
Yeah.And same detonation device,too

302
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,070
The gas station closed 15 minutes prior to the explosion

303
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,230
Fortunately,

304
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,780
the worker had already gone home

305
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,110
No casualties,an escalation in the size of the explosion,

306
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,850
and a decrease in the number of victims

307
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,000
We need to do a grid search as soon as possible

308
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,880
What do I tell them we're looking for?

309
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,410
Said his message would be here when we arrived

310
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,070
Clear!

311
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,460
It's a book

312
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,330
Says,"manifesto"

313
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,600
Bag it

314
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,700
His manifesto's main demand is completely unrealistic--

315
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,020
stop all automated machinery that's replaced american workers within a week

316
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,390
And if his demands aren't met,

317
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,050
he says he'll detonate even larger bombs

318
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,030
So we have an anti-technology bomber who so far has attacked

319
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,700
computers,an automated cashier,

320
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,830
an automated gas station,

321
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,280
and a smart bus

322
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,810
Who calls himself allegro

323
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,100
Wh--what was that?

324
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,260
He told me to call him allegro

325
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,080
Of course

326
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
yeah It's a book

327
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,290
Yeah It ought to be

328
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,250
No,no It's an actual book--

329
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,850
a novel I read it as a kid

330
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,600
It's called empty planet by one-hit-wonder author david hansberry

331
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,110
It's got it all-- technoids,minutians

332
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,210
All that stuff's in there

333
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,370
It's robots that take over the world once they figure out how to reproduce with humans

334
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,540
Essentially,humanity's lost to technology

335
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,620
And the hero of the book

336
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,960
is a 12-year-old boy named allegro who builds an army and fights for the humans

337
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,990
Morgan,have garcia get as much information as possible on the author of empty planet

338
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,150
David hansberry?

339
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,250
Uh,hansberry,yeah

340
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,660
I'm on it

341
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,810
There was a passenger on the bus yesterday,

342
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,260
a dr.Emory cooke

343
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,940
He's supposed to be some kind of computer genius,

344
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,260
pioneer in artificial life

345
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,020
Yeah,cooke

346
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,220
He developed software that mirrors the human reproductive system

347
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,360
Computers that can replicate themselves

348
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,440
So maybe cooke was the target and not the smart bus

349
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,950
If so,that would definitely be imitating events from the book

350
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,770
Allegro and his army not only destroyed robots,

351
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,660
but they assassinate the scientists that are responsible for creating them

352
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,420
Dr.Cooke was sitting right in front of sylvia cohen

353
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,120
And the umbrella was initially found underneath dr.Cooke's seat

354
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,870
Yeah

355
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,540
Thank you for coming so quickly,dr.Cooke

356
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,670
People,particularly some religious fundamentalists,

357
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,670
oppose the work you do

358
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,020
Do you receive any threatening letters

359
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,690
or phone calls from anyone about your work?

360
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,580
Never

361
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,290
Really?

362
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,220
I've managed to put to rest

363
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,110
certain anxieties about the godlessness of

364
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,620
artificial life by openly sharing my own personal beliefs

365
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,970
Which are?

366
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,340
No scientific knowledge precludes the existence of god

367
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,990
There are also those with very strong ethical concerns

368
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:57,360
Ethical concerns revolve mainly around the manipulation of already-existing life forms

369
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,560
My work is on creating artificial life,

370
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,480
which presents far less ethical dilemma

371
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,250
Not from the man that put the bomb on the bus yesterday

372
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,160
He seems to be obsessed with the science fiction novel

373
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,260
by david hansberry called empty planet

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,300
Are you familiar with the book?

375
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,840
I'm friends with the author

376
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,880
The author of the empty planet used david hansberry as a pseudonym

377
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,880
Come on,garcia,I know you got his name,

378
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,890
so give it up

379
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,830
Her name,

380
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,940
you cute little chauvinist,

381
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,320
is ursula kent,

382
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,310
and she's a literature professor at

383
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,690
oh,my

384
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,030
In seattle,st Dennis university

385
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,630
Where the floppy disc bombs were set

386
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,580
Uh-huh

387
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,480
Oh,you are the light of my life,sweet lady

388
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,090
Íô!Íô!Íô!Íô!Íô!Íô!

389
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,480
Drives me crazy when you talk that voulez coucher stuff to me

390
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,780
Stop it

391
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,820
Ursula kent is a brilliant woman

392
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,260
She's a post-modernist literature professor

393
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,030
Every semester I give a guest lecture in her class

394
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,940
She--she's here?

395
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,360
In seattle?

396
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,470
Is that not what I just said?

397
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,640
Sir,this guy reads empty planet like it's prophecy

398
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,810
He's targeting what he considers threats to the survival of human beings,

399
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,420
and I believe that he finds you one of these threats,dr.Cooke

400
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,580
As I've said,

401
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,200
I rather doubt that

402
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,210
Do you think the fact that

403
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,630
you were on that bus and you're friends with the author is a coincidence?

404
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,560
A cognitive scientist at M.I.T. Once said,

405
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,720
"coincidences seem to be the source for some of our greatest irrationalities"

406
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,080
Our minds see coincidences and--

407
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,310
I understood him

408
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,150
I'd like to attach a protective detail for you,dr. Cooke,

409
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,180
until we find the guy

410
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,790
No Thank you

411
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,910
-Excuse me?
-Really,now

412
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,710
Do I seem like the sort who would want to be

413
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,530
followed around all day by a government goon squad?

414
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,930
I don't think so

415
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,300
Goon squad?

416
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,450
Ever talk to someone who wants to continually show you he's smarter than you?

417
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,260
Everyday

418
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,650
I really hate that

419
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,240
Garcia found the author of the book

420
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,840
David hansberry's just a pen name

421
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,440
-The real name is ursula
-ursula ken*

422
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,860
The professor of post-modern literature at

423
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,090
st.Dennis university where the floppy disc bombs were sent

424
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,890
Hmm.Anyway,JJ'S contacting her We can go see her any time

425
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,980
Let's go

426
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,090
We need to stop by a bookstore and get a copy of empty planet

427
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,720
I want to re-read before we talk to the author

428
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
I haven't read it since I was 6.

429
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,170
6?

430
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,380
I was still ridin' by big wheel at 6 years old

431
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,630
Do you mind?It'll only take 10 minutes

432
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,930
To buy it or read it?

433
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,160
Uh,both,actually

434
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,810
Have agent casey set up protection for dr.Cooke

435
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,460
Like him or not,he's in danger

436
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,400
He used a compression detonator

437
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,910
Looks like it was under the seat

438
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,200
Once he sat down,it arms Detonated when he 
released the pressure by getting up

439
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,410
We wanted to make sure nothing went wrong this time

440
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,310
Nobody moved the umbrella

441
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,950
Hotch, gideon just talked to this guy

442
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,120
Offered him security but he refused

443
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,950
We were gonna set it up anyway

444
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,600
I doubt it would have helped

445
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,670
What do you mean?

446
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,270
Compression detonator

447
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,280
It had to have been set when he was with us or it 
would have detonated when he arrived at the field office

448
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,750
I'll get security to start running 
tapes of the lab for the last 2 hours

449
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,440
Good

450
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,040
Gideon

451
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,950
I'm glad no one but dr Cooke was hurt

452
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,590
Dr Cooke wasn't hurt

453
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,800
He was murdered

454
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,700
Murder is not murder during war

455
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,090
But this-- this isn't a war You're--you're

456
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,300
you're livin' a novel , You're livin' a fiction

457
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,140
- Will you meet my demands?  
- I can'T

458
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,100
Stopping all automation at a week, 
you know that's impossible

459
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,210
And I want my manifesto printed in 
the seattle ledger by tonight

460
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,450
Not the new york times, washington post?

461
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,000
Somebody in seattle important to you?

462
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,500
There's more work to be done Much, much more

463
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,610
In fact, I'm going to visit an 
old acquaintance right now

464
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,920
I'd invite you, but you're 
all going to be very busy

465
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,600
Got it

466
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,560
It was the last copy left, According to the clerk,

467
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,990
it's actually become a pretty popular 
novel in science fiction circles

468
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,780
Hotch

469
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,990
A suspicious package was found at the water works

470
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,930
The report says it looks like a pipe bomb,
We're on our way there now

471
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,710
Ok, keep me posted

472
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,460
Unsub says we're gonna be busy

473
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,850
Got it

474
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,490
Looks like a pipe bomb at the water works

475
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,120
Are we gonna go there?

476
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,360
No, we'll still go see professor kent

477
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,090
Seatbelts

478
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,960
Hello Ursula kent

479
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,410
Hi My pleasure, professor kent Jason gideon, FBI

480
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,580
This is dr.Reid

481
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,700
It's a real pleasure to meet 
you I'm a fan of your work

482
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,330
Well,that's very nice of you to say

483
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,320
Um, we can speak in my office

484
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,060
Lead the way

485
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,510
Your book has become a significant 
part of our investigation

486
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,360
So your colleague explained

487
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,000
I can't imagine how, though

488
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,520
Bomber sees it as some kind of prophetic work

489
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,410
He's attempting to save humanity by 
stopping the proliferation of robotic technology

490
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,900
Well, that's absurd

491
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,360
He's written a document-like manifesto 
called a guide to practical living,

492
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,730
and several sections of it are 
lifted directly from empty planet

493
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,550
He's taken up what he believes to be your cause 

494
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,930
and he's killing people for the sake of it

495
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,260
But empty planet is a fantasy

496
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,360
Not to this man

497
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,510
How could anyone think it's more than that?

498
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,880
Unfortunately,it's impossible to predict how 
an unstable mind will interpret something

499
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,820
And it's caused him to kill people?

500
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,930
Do you know dr Emory cooke?

501
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,500
Very well

502
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,880
- He spoke to your classes?  
- Yes

503
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,610
Dr Cooke was murdered by the bomber an hour ago

504
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,840
No

505
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,070
clear!  

506
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,620
It's safe now, Another small charge 

507
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,280
More meant to scare than to harm

508
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,260
Definitely the same unsub

509
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,860
Same signature

510
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,330
Casey

511
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,940
We'll get there ASAP

512
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,820
There's another bomb at the post office

513
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,450
Let's go

514
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,120
Professor, what is that?

515
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,890
this is something someone-- 

516
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,080
a brilliant man gave me a long time ago before he died

517
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,030
Actually, it's part of the inspiration for empty planet

518
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:19,000
James was a rather early alarmist about how much 
we were letting technology control our lives

519
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,690
It's become a sort of talisman for me

520
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,560
You wear it when you teach?

521
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,370
Sometimes, yes

522
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,070
This has been etched on the bomber's devices

523
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,020
Oh, my god

524
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,240
Bomber's written a manifesto he wants published,

525
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,020
but not in the national newspaper

526
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,220
He wants it published in the seattle ledger

527
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,450
He wants someone here to read it

528
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,740
Have you ever had a student you think might 
be capable of doing something like this?

529
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,430
One of my students? Someone who hates technology ?

530
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,630
I'm a post-modernist

531
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,720
In my area of study,technological 
inventions are often viewed as art objects

532
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,760
That's true,but oftentimes the biggest critics 
of technology are those with scientific backgrounds,

533
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,130
and your students definitely fit that category

534
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,940
I need you to read this

535
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,480
Tell me if the writing seems
at all familiar to you

536
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,350
We'll wait

537
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,880
Morgan

538
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,580
Gideon, this guy's pissing me off right about now

539
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,360
This is the fourth location in the last 50 minutes

540
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,410
All of them have been very small bombs

541
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,850
What kind of locations?

542
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,200
Municipal Water works,

543
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,630
main post office,

544
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,710
social security office,

545
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,370
and now we're at the main branch of the library

546
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,850
Government buildings

547
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,310
Nothing involving technology

548
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,360
No, nothin'

549
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,680
Then what's the purpose?

550
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,150
Distract us, keep us movin'

551
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,900
He's doing a damn good job,
gideon,I don't like this at all

552
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,840
We're chasin' this guy ,
We gotta do somethin' to get ahead of him

553
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,200
Professor kent is reading the manifesto

554
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,670
I hope she reads as fast as reid

555
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,360
No one reads as fast as reid

556
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,640
- Is this the syllabus for your class?  
- Yes 

557
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,640
Is it the same every semester?

558
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,700
Mostly, maybe a book or project changed

559
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,600
You only have 2 guest lecturers listed

560
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,610
Yes Uh,dr.Cooke and dr.Brasier

561
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,570
I always have those two, 
they're the only two I invite

562
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,260
They speak to every new class

563
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,710
Dr.Cooke is-- was an expert on artificial life,

564
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
- and dr.Brasier   
- artificial intelligence

565
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,590
Dr.Brasier have an office on campus?

566
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,720
No,

567
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,790
it's cross town at rolling hills

568
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,410
Morgan,I may have something

569
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,290
Hey,shelly

570
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,780
I'm on my way to the symposium now

571
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,270
Then save me a seat

572
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,500
It's not rude

573
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,940
Fine, then tell them

574
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,230
A VIP Is coming and you'll lose 
your job if you don't save the seat

575
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,160
How long ago did her assistant say she left?

576
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,040
- Minutes  
- Good,

577
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,610
maybe she's not in the car yet

578
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,650
shelly,I'm the VIP

579
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,460
Yes, I am

580
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,800
- I don't care what you tell them  
- Stop the car!

581
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,830
it`s long i can See, 
I'm tired and I need a seat

582
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,500
ma'am! Stop the car!

583
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,910
Listen to me, Do not touch the 
ignition, Put the car in park

584
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,310
Ma'am, put the car in park, don't touch the ignition

585
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,200
Don't panic

586
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,610
- I'm FBI  
- FBI?!

587
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,570
- Are you dr.Brasier?  
- Yes, I'm dr.Brasier

588
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,860
It's her Girl,

589
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,740
let me call you back

590
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,470
Doctor,do not move

591
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,100
Excuse me?

592
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,350
I need you to sit as still as you can, please

593
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,920
Damn it

594
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,110
doctor, listen carefully

595
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,200
You must sit as still as you 
posbly can, you understand?

596
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,310
Why?

597
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,780
There is a bomb under your seat

598
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,380
Wait on the court

599
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,420
Be of good courage and he 
will strengthen thine heart

600
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,420
Doctor

601
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,910
you're gonna be just fine

602
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,570
He will strengthen thine heart

603
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,020
Every device this guy has 
made has been fairly basic

604
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,870
I'm guessing this is a simple 
lever action compression detonator

605
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,600
Kinda like a door latch

606
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,690
I'm gonna use this,

607
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,560
put it between the latch and the 
seat bottom to depress the latch,

608
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,180
and I think we should be ok

609
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,100
- Should?  
- Well

610
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,080
if there's mercury, we got problems

611
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,770
Thanks, hotchc

612
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,580
Yeah, I'm right here

613
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,890
So?

614
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,650
Bomb tech's just about ready

615
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,910
Maybe we should get over there

616
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,300
No, I think we would just be in the way

617
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,740
What about morgan?

618
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,070
He hasn't changed his mind

619
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,530
Morgan?

620
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,210
I'm ordering you to step away from the car

621
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,380
Hotch, you know I respect you

622
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,970
I'm not leavin' her

623
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,890
You should listen to your friends

624
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,380
don't do that

625
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,520
Don't you turn on me, doc

626
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,570
I'm right here With you

627
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,270
Got it?

628
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,930
Ok

629
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,770
My girl is using one of my hands

630
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,940
Now, cassie

631
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,210
Yeah?

632
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,460
You might the other one, so come on

633
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,710
Do what you gotta do, let's do this

634
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,410
Step back

635
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,790
Thank you

636
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,560
Aside from the sections of my novel 
that were blatantly plagiarized,

637
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,640
I didn't recognize anything

638
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,040
It's just page after page of the ravings of a lunatic

639
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,690
Right now,a young man I greatly respect 

640
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,510
and admire is putting his life on 
the line because of that lunatic

641
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,710
I'll look through it again

642
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,800
Thank you

643
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,580
You're gonna be just fine

644
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,750
Wait on the lord, I say 

645
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,640
That was lucky

646
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,550
Yeah, this one

647
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,180
Yeah, they're ok

648
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,940
Good

649
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,060
Now blow the car up

650
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,430
You're blowing it up?

651
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:57,620
Best way to keep dr Brasier safe is by letting 
the bomber think he was successful in Killing herc

652
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,530
Neighbors will hear an explosion, 
it'll be on the news

653
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,710
You have a complicated life

654
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,890
It's a complicated world

655
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,560
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help

656
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,360
Yeah, me,too

657
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,260
Give the manifesto a little more thought

658
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,670
Maybe something will occur to you without 
the pressure of us looming over you

659
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,890
You could go back over your student list

660
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,730
Think about the males

661
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,800
Anything odd about them

662
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,800
Guy probably had a temper

663
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,870
Somethin' you maybe haven't thought about for years

664
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,640
I've have my T A Pull the files

665
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,480
May I ask you something, ma'am?

666
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,960
Of course

667
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,040
Why didn't you ever write another book?

668
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,320
I guess it was the only story I needed to tell

669
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,180
I'll be working in my office most of 
the night,Don't hesitate to call

670
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,650
Thank you

671
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,670
- Have a good night  
- you too

672
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:27,530
Melissa, I need you to pull the file 
and thesis paper on a student from last year

673
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,570
Yeah, his name is kenneth roberts

674
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,690
Great, thanks

675
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,930
So it begins with the father's suicide-- 

676
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,700
Okay we got 5 crime scenes' worth 
of new information to go through

677
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,680
And the targets that unsub chose for the decoy bombs-
do they force a change in the profile?

678
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,330
I don't think so ,I think they are what the are

679
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,730
Decoys to throw us off the trail of dr Brasier

680
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,500
Reid, what's that?

681
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,530
It's the subplot of the empty planet book

682
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,910
Allegro kills his mother?

683
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,030
Yeah, at the end,

684
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,830
he discovers he's adopted ,
He's reunited with his birth mom

685
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,900
He thanks her for having the strength 
to give him a better life,but,

686
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,460
ironically, he realizes that she herself has become a robot,

687
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,330
so he kills her

688
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,710
He sacrifices the one person in the world he has 
a biological connection with for the greater good

689
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,340
I thought we were talking about 
some geeky sci-fi book here

690
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,770
That sounds like greek tragedy

691
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,740
It's not played as a tragedy at all though

692
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,130
In fact, his mother's incredibly 
proud of this final act,

693
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,130
like it's the ultimate fulfillment of his destiny,

694
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,560
proof that-- proof that she was right 
to have given him up in the first place

695
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,970
Wait a minute, If he kills her, 
how do you know she was proud?

696
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,970
It's told from her point of view ,The whole book is

697
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,630
It's kind of like she's talking 
to the reader from heaven

698
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,430
Mother's the narrator

699
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,060
Yeah it's really her story

700
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,850
Only story she needed to tell

701
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,690
And in order to fulfill the story, 
he's gotta kill his mother

702
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,780
Don't hate the book

703
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,910
Without this, I never would have known you at all

704
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,700
Mother

705
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,380
Kenneth,did you do this?

706
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,340
Did you kill dr Cooke?

707
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,540
You've read my manifesto

708
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,970
Yes,and,uh,

709
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,310
I thought some things seemed familiar

710
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,520
And I know why you wrote empty planet

711
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,900
I know what you've been trying to say

712
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,050
Kenneth

713
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,390
You've misunderstood

714
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,850
I don'T think so

715
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,440
Kenneth

716
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,880
the book is a work of fiction

717
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,740
- The book is a gift!  
- No,it isn'T

718
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,180
It's just a story

719
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,730
Then let me tell you a story, professor

720
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,930
My mother died when I was eight

721
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,630
And then several years ago, 
my father needed a blood transfusion,

722
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,290
and I tried to donate, only to discover 
that we had nothing genetically in common

723
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,580
I had to watch him wither away,

724
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,780
but before he died, 
he told me I was adopted

725
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,760
This is not what you think

726
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,050
I needed to find my mother, 
but the records were sealed

727
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,970
All I knew was that I was adopted in youngstown, 

728
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,460
ohio

729
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:50,270
And then I came across an article 
about professor ursula kent

730
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,400
Favorite daughter of youngstown, 
famous writer of empty planet,

731
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,210
and do you know, do you know,

732
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,300
what that article said?

733
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,300
It--it said

734
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:07,050
that you had given up a baby for adoption and 
that baby was the inspiration for the book

735
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,430
That is true

736
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,180
That is true ,But that is not the whole story

737
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,760
When did you give up your baby for adoption?

738
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,520
Wasn't it 26 years ago?

739
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,580
In youngstown, ohio?

740
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,070
Go GO !

741
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,540
Kenneth, listen to me--

742
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:47,200
no! It's your turn to listen

743
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,620
Come on! 

744
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,930
I came out here to take your class For a year,

745
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,980
I sat right there, Right there!

746
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,910
- And you never saw me!  
- If you'd just-- 

747
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,400
- how could you not recognize me?    
- If you'd just come to me,

748
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,930
- I could've explained   
- then I realized,

749
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,940
the only way to get you to see me was 
to live out the book ,But guess what?

750
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,540
I did that And now,

751
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,200
you see me, don't you?

752
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,680
- This is our destiny!     
- Morgan, stairs, Go around

753
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,220
the baby I gave up, it was a girl

754
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,960
- It was a daughter   
- That's a lie

755
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,900
It was a girl

756
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,570
- That's a lie!  
- I'm so sorry

757
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,280
- I know the pain you're in     
- why do you keep lying to me?!

758
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,570
You're not my son!

759
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,130
I promise I will do everything 
I can to help you find your birth   

760
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,930
- stop it!    
- Allegro!

761
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,770
Wait

762
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,110
Wait! Wait

763
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,930
Don't want to hurt anyone

764
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,110
You've gone to great lengths not 
to hurt anyone under unintentionally-

765
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,260
leave us alone!

766
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,930
No,we can't do that,allegro 
We cannot leave you alone

767
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm ok Listen,

768
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,240
I'm--I'm-- I'm ok

769
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,150
Doesn't have to end this way

770
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,310
- This is how it ends!    
- You can change the ending--  

771
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,110
- this is how it ends!  
- How does it begin?

772
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,710
I don't even know the story ,Tell me the story

773
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,800
You don't know the story! 

774
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,090
I want to know, 
I'm in the story right now

775
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,890
Leave us alone! 

776
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,330
Get an ambulance,get him out of here

777
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,650
It's your shoulder

778
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,030
He's lost, He's just lost

779
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,720
Just relax

780
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,480
It'll be all right

781
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,720
Can't blame him

782
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,690
Your eyes,ursula, I wanna see your eyes

783
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,920
There they are. There you go

784
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,060
- You listening?  
- I'm listening

785
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,770
He just wants to know who he is

786
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,250
That's all

787
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,930
I understand

788
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,680
Open those eyes ,There you go

789
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,460
Right ,Keep looking at me

790
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,440
It's gonna be all right

791
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,910
Just relax

792
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,730
I'll be right back

793
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,530
Do not cheat 

794
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,750
JJ,A lot of science fiction's 
deeper than you might think

795
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,400
I mean,there are some genuine human emotions-- 

796
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,730
yeah,let me save you the time, reid

797
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,510
I am never going to comicon with you

798
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,330
- I...  
- gin

799
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,150
What,you don't trust me?

800
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,320
- come on   
- Let's just make sure

801
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,110
it's fun beating a genius

802
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,110
Genius dr Reid let you win

803
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,420
I hear you were worried about me

804
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,610
'Scuse me?

805
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,890
The bomb at the garage under the car?

806
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:23,420
A young man that I greatly admire and 
respect is putting his life on the line

807
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
What?

808
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,270
I do something?

809
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,780
What you did with the bomb, stupid

810
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,030
Gideon,I couldn't leave that lady 
out there by herself like that

811
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,280
