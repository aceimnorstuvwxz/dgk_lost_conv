1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,800
呦 趕緊!
Yo,hurry up!

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,500
別落下我
Don't start without me.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,580
快滾過來 快點
Move your ass. Come on.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,260
我TM在給你拿啤酒呢 住嘴!
I'm gettin' your damn beer. Shut up!

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,670
你住嘴 賤人 住嘴?
Shut up,woman. Shut up?

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,380
哦 要我住嘴 啊?
Oh,me shut up,huh?

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,520
都給我住嘴
Shut up,everyone.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,930
Will 是你嗎?
Will,is that you?

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,750
Will? 好戲上演了
Will? Here he comes.

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,870
Will?
Will?

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,080
他倒下了
He's down.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,910
來啊 站起來 站起來
Go on,get up. Get up.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,150
別幹傻事哦
Don't be stupid.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,930
我們不想惹麻煩
We don't want any trouble.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,410
要什麼就自己拿吧
Take whatever you want.

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,760
我才不管你要怎麼樣
I don't care what you want.

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,870
你沒有理由傷害她們啊
There's no reason to hurt anyone.

18
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,670
又是一腳
Here it comes.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,620
一定疼死了
That had to hurt.

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,590
你丫怎麼可能... 知道我有什麼理由?
How could you possibly... Know what my reasons are?

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,930
這傢伙想站起來
Our boy's trying to get up.

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,690
哪個是你的妞兒?
Which one of them belongs to you?

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,180
我猜猜
Let me guess.

24
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,850
哦 求求你別傷害他! 求求你
Oh,please don't hurt him! Please.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,180
就是她了
It could be her.

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,250
和你丈夫吻別吧
Kiss your husband goodbye.

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,200
William...
William...

28
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,080
你們為什麼要這麼做? 為什麼?
Why are you doing this? Why?

29
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,240
為什麼不呢?
Why not?

30
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,820
拍到了嗎? 拍到了 兄弟
Did you get that? I got it,baby.

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,380
有多少死者?
And how many dead?

32
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,390
好的 好 我們會盡快過去的 謝謝
Ok. Yeah,we'll be there as soon as we can. Thanks.

33
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,030
得掛了 讓我猜猜
Well,i gotta go. Let me guess.

34
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,260
別想早下班了 入室行兇 四人死亡
Don't get comfortable. We've got 4 dead in a home invasion.

35
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,510
要去哪? 就在本地 華盛頓東南部
Where we headed? It's local. Southeast d.c.

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,490
死因是什麼? 鈍器造成的外傷 未使用刀具和槍支
What was the cause of death? Blunt force trauma. No knife,no gun.

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,710
要求我們介入嗎? 是的 警方希望我們去現場和他們碰頭
Have we been invited in? Yeah. Cops want us to meet them at the crime scene.

38
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,260
東南部不是最近打砸搶很猖獗嗎?
Isn't southeast where all that vandalism's been lately?

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,340
對 就是那一區域 覺得其中有聯繫嗎?
Same area,yeah. Think they could be connected?

40
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,550
不知道 但使用的兇器與 典型入室行兇手法並不相符
I don't know. I mean,the weapon doesn't exactly fit the typical m.o.of a home invasion killer.

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,920
倒是值得考慮
Well, it's worth considering.

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,200
打砸搶升級到命案很常見
It's common for vandalism to escalate into violence.

43
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,240
加上很多人都有怒氣 該街區的居民大部分都是工薪階層的黑人
Plus there's a lot of anger out there. That neighborhood's mostly black working class.

44
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,230
是的 現在要改造成高級社區  那堛漫~民日子就更難過了
Yeah. Now it's being gentrified while the people who live there are having a tough time.

45
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,840
受害人很有錢? 嗯 是兩對夫婦
Were the victims wealthy? Yeah,it was two couples.

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,020
都是新搬過去的有錢人家
The were both part of the influx of new wealth in the area.

47
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,400
有東西被搶嗎? 什麼都沒拿
Police report a robbery? Nothing was taken.

48
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,640
受害人什麼種族?
What race were the victims?

49
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,380
一對是白人 一對是黑人
One couple was white, the other black.

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,670
動機不是種族仇恨
Not racially motivated.

51
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,080
JJ 通知Rossi和Reid 我們五點出發
Jj,find rossi and reid, tell them we leave in 5.

52
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,180
如果這和打砸搶有所關聯  殺死四人 可是相當猛烈的升級啊
Well,if this is related to vandalism, 4 dead is a hell of an escalation.

53
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,130
這麼說有可能還會死更多?
So there's the potential for a lot more bodies out there?

54
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,160
這正是我擔心的
That's what i'm afraid of.

55
00:03:38,290 --> 00:04:08,480

<font color=#DB70DB>Criminal Minds Season05 Episode04 Hopeless</font>

56
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,590
Kingman Brewster Jr. 說過 (美國教育學家外交家 曾任耶魯校長)
Kingman brewster jr.Said,

57
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,350
"暴力無法給人持久的希望 只能讓人暫不心絕"
"there is no lasting hope in violence, only temporary relief from hopelessness."

58
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,300
Andrews探員? 我是Jennifer Jareau
Detective andrews? Jennifer jareau.

59
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,820
這是探員Rossi Morgan Hotchner  Prentiss和Reid博士
These are agents rossi, morgan, hotchner,prentiss, and dr. Reid.

60
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,380
謝謝你們這麼快趕過來 你有什麼消息?
Thanks for getting here so fast. What can you tell us?

61
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,630
看起來一名受害人是下車時遭到攻擊的
Looks like one of the victims was attacked when he got out of his car.

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,810
兇手很可能用他的鑰匙開了門 讓其他受害者大吃一驚
Meaning whoever did this probably used his keys to get inside and surprise the other victims.

63
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,670
是誰發現屍體的?
Who found the bodies?

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,230
清潔工 她正在錄口供
The cleaning woman. She's giving her statement now.

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,270
Dave 你和Morgan還有Prentiss進去看看 我們負責這兒
Dave,would you,morgan, and prentiss go inside. We'll cover out here.

66
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,650
我知道你們對這種案子都習慣了 不過 堶扈u是慘不忍睹
I know you're all used to this, but,uh,it's a hell of a sight in there.

67
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,380
下得了這樣的手 連畜生都不如
Whoever did this ain't human.

68
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,550
鄰居看到了什麼嗎?
The neighbors see anything?

69
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,010
你們也知道 因為打砸搶行為太多 該區的巡邏車數量都加倍了 卻沒什麼線索
Oh,you know, the patrol cars are even doubled in this area because of t vandalismNothing.

70
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,540
不明嫌犯的行動肯定非常迅速有效
The unsub would have to be extremely fast and efficient.

71
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,670
看這個 這有一大灘血  受害人被拖到門口 沿途有滴狀血跡
Look at this. There's a pool of blood here and then drops as the victim moves toward the door.

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,220
受害人什麼身材? 1米85到1米88吧 怎麼了?
How big was the victim? 6'1",6'2". Why?

73
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,280
如果他能自己走過去的話  應該會有搏鬥的痕跡
Well,if he was strong enough to move under his own power, you'd expect signs of a struggle.

74
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,220
如果沒有 也應會有被拽動的痕跡
And if not,there'd most likely be drag marks.

75
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,500
他是被抬過去的
He was carried.

76
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,020
一個人抬他可是很沉的
That's a lot of dead weight for one person to move alone.

77
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,460
門廊處也沒有大灘血跡
There's no pool of blood on the porch,

78
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,980
說明兇手不需要把他放下來 再去開門
which means they didn't have to set him down to open the door.

79
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,930
受害人甲被放在了這
Victim one gets dropped here.

80
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,440
同時受害人乙走到了拐角看出了什麼事...
While number 2 comes around the corner to see what's happening, and...

81
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,450
不明嫌犯在這襲擊了他
The unsub attacks him here.

82
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,660
第一次襲擊時 女性受害人也許還坐在桌邊
The female victims were probably here when the first attack occurred.

83
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,590
也就是說 得有人能馬上控制住她們
Which means somebody would have to control them pretty quickly.

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,980
你覺得有幾個不明嫌犯?
How many unsubs are you thinking?

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,080
至少得有一個把屍體搬進來 另一個襲擊受害人乙
At least one to move the body inside, another one to take out man number 2,

86
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,660
再來一個控制住其他兩個
And one more to subdue the others.

87
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,040
打砸搶可是會滋生從眾心理的
Well,vandalism breeds a pack mentality.

88
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,710
如果是同一夥人的話  我們找的就是三到四人的團體
If it is the same unsubs, we're looking at a group of 3,maybe 4.

89
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,600
肯定不是未成年人 他們的行動太有效了
These aren't kids. They're too efficient.

90
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,230
局面控制精準 青少年沒那麼縝密
There's a control and precision. Juveniles are sloppy.

91
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,560
我同意 這些手法都很嫻熟
He's right. There is nothing tentative about these kills.

92
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,810
沒有任何新手的痕跡
There's no experimentation.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,230
這些人知道自己在幹什麼
These guys know what they're doing.

94
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,210
我不確定 你有什麼想法?
I don't know. What are you thinking?

95
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,320
我能理解打砸搶升級成命案 但那也是逐漸演變的
I can understand vandalism escalating into violence, but that's usually gradual.

96
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,730
比如先襲擊或謀殺一個人 可這個?
And assault, a single murder maybe, but come on,this?

97
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,730
一夜之間就進化完全了
This feels fully evolved.

98
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,580
9月3日 15輛豪華轎車的窗玻璃被打碎
September 3rd, 15 luxury cars had their windows smashed.

99
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,180
9月14日 一家新開的高級精品服裝店遭搶
September 14th, a new upscale clothing boutique was vandalized.

100
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,630
9月24日 兩家以富人為主顧的餐館遭襲擊
September 24th, two different restaurants, both catering to a wealthy clientele,

101
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,690
正面窗戶被打碎 店內財物被破壞
had their front windows smashed and their interiors torn apart,

102
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,140
最後是10月1日
and finally,october 1st,

103
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,980
一戶新裝修的人家在搬進去前被徹底洗劫
a newly renovated townhome was ransacked before the family could move in.

104
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,120
這麼說他們攻擊的目標從公共財物變成了 私人住所 但是沒有受害人
So they went from attacking public property to a private residence, but no victim.

105
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,530
問題是 是什麼讓他們從那樣... 變成了這樣?
The question is,what makes them move from that... To this?

106
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,390
打砸搶的地點 都代表著這個街區 快速演變的外在和經濟狀況
The vandalism targets were all symbols of the neighborhood's changing makeup and economy.

107
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,740
而這些受害人 也許有什麼特別的地方激怒了不明嫌犯
Maybe there's something specific about these victims that set the unsubs off.

108
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,200
我已經和他們的家人談過了
I've spoken to the victims' family members.

109
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,740
他們答應盡力協助我們調查
They've agreed to come in and help however they can.

110
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,540
Garcia 查查幾個社交網站
Garcia,check social networking sites.

111
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,160
看看不明嫌犯有沒有在網上策劃襲擊
See if these unsubs have coordinated these attacks online.

112
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,170
就算只吱過一聲 我也會像獵狗一樣 把他們揪出來 長官
If they dare tweet, I shall flush them out like a bird dog,sir.

113
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,090
有一個疑問 為什麼不明嫌犯 在社區堹鄐ㄓ牏H注意呢?
We need to be asking how these unsubs manage to not stand out in this neighborhood.

114
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,460
這些犯罪地點 都是新興財富和地位的象徵
Each of these crime scene locations are a representation of new wealth and status,

115
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,450
但它們的周圍區域 仍是長期的住戶
but the area surrounding the crime scenes are still populated by longtime residents

116
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,190
他們逐漸遭到排擠
who are slowly being pushed out.

117
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,500
許多被排擠的人 都為社區的翻新出過力
That's a lot of disenfranchised people who are all part of the neighborhood makeup.

118
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,910
不明嫌犯不招人注意 極有可能是因為他們就住在這
Most likely these unsubs don't stand out because they're probably local themselves.

119
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,350
我不覺得 我同意Rossi的推測
I don't know. I'm with rossi.

120
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,930
我是說 他們很憤怒我能理解  可如此的狠手?
I mean,anger I get, but this much violence?

121
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,020
兇手至少是三個滿腔憤怒的人
We're looking at at least 3 men with an incredible amount of rage.

122
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,210
這種情緒怎麼藏的住?
Where do you hide that?

123
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,570
Turner
Turner.

124
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,980
能不能告訴這位女士 已經10月14日了 她怎麼還不能搬進新房子?
You care to tell the lady why it's october 14th and she's still not ready to move into her house?

125
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,200
可能不行
Not particularly.

126
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,210
你說什麼?
What did you just say?

127
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,000
算了 沒關係的
It's ok. Really.

128
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,220
不 有關係 向這位女士道歉 回答問題
No,it's not. Why don't you apologize to the lady, answer the question.

129
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,590
對不起 女士 我發現地基有點小問題
My apologies,ma'am. Found a slight flaw in the foundation.

130
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,020
我不想你晚上一個人在家時
Hate to think of you home all alone at night,

131
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,040
整棟房子突然塌下來
suddenly the whole place just collapses underneath you.

132
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,700
好了 回去敲石膏板吧 我雇你就是幹這個的
Ok. Now get back to the drywall. That's what I pay you for.

133
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,570
讓別人擔心那地基吧
Let somebody else worry about the foundation.

134
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,350
我讓Garcia查了目標區域的記錄
I had garcia run records on anyone in the target area

135
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,370
看去年有誰的抵押物贖回權被取消的
who in the last year was foreclosed upon, filed for bankruptcy,

136
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,000
申請過破產或失業的 然後把名單縮小到
or applied for unemployment and then narrowed that list down to men

137
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,830
25至45歲的男性 結果呢?
between the ages of 25 and 45. And?

138
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,620
有713個符合
713 hits.

139
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,910
受害人家屬來了
Victims' families are here.

140
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,960
節哀順變
I'm very sorry about your son.

141
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,040
我們想要查清 這到底是模式化行兇 還是隨機案件
We're looking to see if there's a pattern or if your son's killing was truly random.

142
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,210
這麼說 就你知道的 沒有什麼威脅?
So,there were no threats that you knew of?

143
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,360
沒有
No.

144
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,500
我能理解這對你來說不容易
I understand this is very difficult for you.

145
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,250
我們也正盡力查出頭緒
We're just trying to make some sense of it.

146
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,070
請坐
Please.

147
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,790
Barnes女士 你需不需要等會再談?
Ms.Barnes,do you need some more time?

148
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,420
他們說如果我想 可以看看William的屍體
They said I could see william's body if I wanted to.

149
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,250
我覺得那不會有什麼好處的
I don't see what good could come from that.

150
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,430
那你們家就你和你哥哥?
It was just you and your brother?

151
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,930
我們的父母幾年前就過世了
Our parents died a few years ago.

152
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,790
對不起
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,780
我知道很多人都會這麼說 但是...
I know that sounds like something people say, but...

154
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,350
我是真心的 感到難過
I truly am sorry.

155
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,140
你成天都碰到這樣的案子嗎?
You deal with cases like this all the time.

156
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,180
是的
Yes,i do.

157
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,860
那對你就是家常便飯了
So it's routine for you.

158
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,910
這種事不會有家常便飯的 Barnes女士
There's nothing routine about what you're going through,ms. Barnes.

159
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,190
你有兄弟姐妹嗎?
Do you have brothers and sisters?

160
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,270
有兩個姐妹
I have two sisters.

161
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,870
如果她們發生了這種事你會怎麼做?
What would you do if something like this happened to one of them?

162
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,190
我會竭盡一切抓到兇手
I would do everything in my power to catch the people who did it.

163
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,210
Will? 是你嗎? Will?
Will? Is that you? Will?

164
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
來看這個
Check this out.

165
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,340
哦 來了
Whoa,man.

166
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,870
超贊 是啊
That's pretty wicked. Yeah.

167
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,950
嘿 過來看看這個
Hey,come look at this.

168
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,230
你說什麼?
What did you just say?

169
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,240
他怎麼了?
What's his problem?

170
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,660
這傢伙想站起來
Our boy's tryin' to get up.

171
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,900
求求你 別傷害他! 求你了
Please,don't hurt him! Please.

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,460
我們出去吧
I say we go out.

173
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,300
你們為什麼要這麼做? 為什麼?
Why are you doing this? Why?

174
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,610
為什麼不呢?
Why not?

175
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,600
拍到了嗎? 拍到了
Did you get that? I got it.

176
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,990
她?
You think?

177
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,620
別人會看見的
People might see.

178
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,570
那又怎樣?
So?

179
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,140
我先上
I go first.

180
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,850
這是你的車? 是啊
This your car? Yeah.

181
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,640
不錯嘛
It's nice.

182
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,460
我只是來接我女朋友
Look,i'm just picking up my girlfriend.

183
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,790
你幹嘛!
What the hell,man!

184
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,800
沒人看見什麼嗎?
Did anybody see anything?

185
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,160
停車場中央可是該死的盲區
It's in the middle of the damn parking lot.

186
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,760
保安錄像呢? 只有門口才有
What about the security cam? It's only on the door.

187
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,350
那位女士是誰? 經理
Who's the lady over there? Manager.

188
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,590
她開門做早餐生意的時候發現了屍體
She discovered the bodies when she came by to open up for the breakfast crowd.

189
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,610
我去和她談談 知道受害人是誰嗎?
I'll go talk to her. Any idea who the victims are?

190
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,300
從駕照來看 一個是這兒的女服務生
Judging by the driver's license, one of them's a waitress here.

191
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,600
叫Jessica Miller 另一個可能是Doug Taylor
It says jessica miller, and the other one's probably doug taylor.

192
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,630
你不能確定?
You can't tell for sure?

193
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,850
老實說 光看是根本看不出來的
Honestly,you can't make an i.d.by looking at them.

194
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,800
Hotch
Hotch.

195
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,650
我停車的時候 一開始根本沒看出來是什麼
I didn't even know what it was at first when I pulled up.

196
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,650
他們膽子更大了 在公共場所殺人
They're definitely getting bolder. These kills were in public.

197
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,350
如果前幾起是象徵什麼的話 這起絕對不是了
If this is supposed to be about symbolism,it's not anymore.

198
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,860
這是家工薪階層的餐廳 受害人是服務生
This is a blue collar restaurant, the victim is a waitress.

199
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,840
沒有特殊意識 就是暴行和力量
There's no ideology behind this. It's about violence and power.

200
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,520
他們殺完人之後還坐在這喝啤酒
They actually sat here and drank beer after the murders.

201
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,160
他們在說他們不在乎
They're telling us that they don't care.

202
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,020
他們像一群外來逃犯
They're like those outlaws that ride into town

203
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,500
告訴你唯一讓他們停下來的方法 就是殺了他們
and let you know the only way to stop them is by killing them.

204
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,550
如果這就是他們想要的 這有一大群警察願意幫忙
If that's what they want, I know plenty of cops who'd be happy to oblige.

205
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,130
警探 我們要保持冷靜 什麼意思?
Detective,we need to keep our heads. Meaning what?

206
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,520
這個程度的恐怖行為 這種隨意性 會產生相應的影響
Meaning that this level of nihilism, this randomness, it can have a mirror impact.

207
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,110
你在警告我別去報仇嗎?
Are you warning me not to go after some kind of revenge?

208
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,050
我只是說這種程度的暴虐行為像是 不明嫌犯發出的挑戰
All i'm saying is this level of brutality is almost like a challenge from the unsubs,

209
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,430
想把所有人都變得和他們一樣
trying to drag everyone down to their level.

210
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,760
這是自然反應
And it's a natural reaction.

211
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,270
我只是在做我的工作
I'm just doing my job.

212
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,190
先回去 可以側寫了
Let's head back. We've got our profile.

213
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,290
有多嚴重? 非常嚴重
How bad? Bad bad.

214
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,360
有人在等你
You have company.

215
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,600
Barnes女士
Ms.barnes.

216
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,730
抱歉我就這麼來了
Sorry for just showing up like this.

217
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,440
我聽到新聞說還有受害人  不知道去哪能得到更多信息
I heard on the news that there were more victims and I didn't know where else to get answers.

218
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,170
這邊請
Please.

219
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,400
謝謝
Thank you.

220
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,210
是真的嗎? 是殺William的那些人幹的?
So is it true? Was it the same people who killed william?

221
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,870
是
Yes.

222
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,270
有嫌疑人了嗎?
Do you have any suspects?

223
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,140
沒有 但是我們已經有了嫌犯側寫
No,but we do have a profile of who these men might be.

224
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,920
兩位探員正告訴警方
Two of our agents are giving it to the police right now

225
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,810
然後在所有的新聞渠道上發佈
and we're getting it to all the news outlets.

226
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,950
你能解釋一下嗎? 拜託
Can you explain it to me? Please.

227
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,770
基本上 這些人已經失去了所有
Basically,these men are completely disenfranchised.

228
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,910
他們覺得活著沒有意義
They feel like they have nothing to live for.

229
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,320
所以尋求人或東西來歸咎責任
And they're looking for anyone or anything to blame.

230
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,560
外界很憤怒 時間很緊
There's a lot of anger out there. Times are tough.

231
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,980
但就算這樣 兇手還是沒有蹤跡
But even so,these men will stand out.

232
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,110
他們想挑起衝突
They'll look to provoke confrontation.

233
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,240
任何原因 都會被他們利用
Any excuse,they'll take it.

234
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,570
他們不偷受害者的東西 不對女人進行性侵害
They don't steal from their victims. They don't sexually assault the women.

235
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,220
他們是為了暴行而暴行
This is about violence for violence's sake.

236
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,140
這好像能傳染 是很怪
It's almost contagious. It's twisted.

237
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,010
但確實有自己傳播的動力
But it's got its own momentum.

238
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,820
我們需要做的是查出為什麼這些人 會走到一起
What we need to do is figure out how these men came together.

239
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,590
我們確定 他們和華盛頓東南部的打砸搶有關
We feel certain that they have some connection to southeast d.c.

240
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,510
沒人發現他們去
They go unnoticed.

241
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,260
現場外面也沒人看見他們
They don't seem out of place.

242
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,960
現場沒有指紋 不明嫌犯應該帶了手套
We have no prints from the crime scenes, so we believe that the unsubs wear gloves.

243
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,730
DNA測試需要幾周時間 我們沒時間
Dna testing could take weeks, and we don't have that kind of time.

244
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,340
東南地區大部分都是黑人  但如果不明嫌犯在這堣u作
The majority of the population of southeast is black, but if the unsubs work in this area,

245
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,900
他們可以是任何人種
they could be any race.

246
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,970
考慮到死者的身形
Because of the physical nature of the murders

247
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,500
以及不明嫌犯能同時控制的受害者人數
and the amount of control these unsubs exert over their victims,

248
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,020
我們相信他們身材高大 至少身體強壯
we believe that these unsubs are large or at least extremely physically fit.

249
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,110
而且喜歡集體行動
And they have a pack mentality.

250
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,970
徹底搜查當地酒吧和餐廳
Canvass the local bars and restaurants.

251
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,120
看是否有一群人符合描述
See if there's a group of men who fit this description.

252
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,820
他們可能很關注新聞
And these men will be obsessed with the media coverage.

253
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,740
任何能再現他們犯罪的情況
Any chance to relive their crimes.

254
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,220
所以監視以往的犯罪現場 很有可能他們會回去
So stake out the past crime scenes. There's a good chance that they'll revisit them.

255
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,060
他們很可能有前科 家庭破裂 或進過少管所
They most likely come from troubled backgrounds, broken homes, youth detention centers.

256
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,240
可能是因為憤怒聚在一起的
They probably bonded over their anger.

257
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,660
現在看來他們成為一個整體了
And now it's like they've become one person.

258
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,730
這就是他們的統一性
It's their whole identity.

259
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,450
這些人覺得自己是一幫匪徒
See,these guys, they think of themselves as some type of gangsters,

260
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,760
社會規則對他們不適用
like society's rules don't apply to them.

261
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,740
他們覺得暴行能得到力量和尊重
They equate violence with power and respect.

262
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,000
也能得到自我尊重
And that goes for selfrespect as well.

263
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,940
他們怎麼可能毫無緣由地 殘殺無辜的人?
What could they possibly get out of killing innocent people for no reason?

264
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,160
這種人和我們不同  他們對別人沒感情
People like this, they're not like you and me. They don't feel empathy.

265
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,170
某種程度上 他們只有在製造恐懼和混亂時 才覺得自己活著
In a way,they only feel alive when they're creating fear and chaos.

266
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,730
靠這些側寫 警察能抓到這些人嗎?
And your profiles,they help catch these people?

267
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,780
會的
They do.

268
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,270
謝謝你幫我熬過這些
Thank you for helping me through this.

269
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,870
我應該的
Of course.

270
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,450
警探
Detective.

271
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,680
我想說 在現場時 我不是想要責怪你不專業
I just wanted to say that at the crime scene it was not my intention to accuse you of being unprofessional.

272
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,830
是嗎?
Yeah?

273
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,400
只是我知道這種案子會讓你質疑人性
It's just that I know what it's like to work a case that makes you question humanity,

274
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,860
所以提醒你克服這些影響並不是最壞的
and it's not the worst thing to remind yourself to rise above it a little,

275
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,560
否則我們會失去自我
or we lose ourselves.

276
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,430
很感謝你告訴他們側寫
I appreciate you giving the men the profile.

277
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,010
<i>杜邦的復仇!</i>
<i>Rage In Dupont!</i>

278
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,120
噢 不
Oh,no.

279
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,030
<i>杜邦區Thompkins廣場將有暴動</i>

280
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,690
我有發現
Sir,i've got something.

281
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,880
我查了社交網站 看不明嫌犯有沒有用電腦交流
I've been monitoring social networking sites to see if the unsubs communicate electronically.

282
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,780
對
Right.

283
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,770
有一條信息跳出來了 我發到你手機了
There's a text that's blowing up. I sent it to your phone.

284
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,240
點擊率已經超過一千
There's over a thousand hits already.

285
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,490
是一個破壞杜邦區附近車和餐廳的計劃
It's a plan to vandalize cars and restaurants around dupont circle.

286
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,470
信息說什麼時候發生?
When does the text say this is supposed to happen?

287
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,180
今晚9點
Tonight,9:00.

288
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,250
杜邦區不在嫌犯慣常活動區
Dupont circle's not in the unsubs' usual comfort zone.

289
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,640
不明嫌犯也不像是劃分了勢力範圍
And it's not like these unsubs to share control.

290
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,340
Andrews警探 我是Hotchner探員
Detective andrews, this is agent hotchner.

291
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,910
我們收到一條警報 已經發給你了
I just sent you a text to which we've been alerted.

292
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,540
好 當然 我們馬上到
Right. Absolutely. We're on our way.

293
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,310
不離開的人一律拘捕
You will be arrested if you do not disperse.

294
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,530
每個入口處都有貨車
We got wagons at every entry point.

295
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,680
他們盡快裝完 我就能把他們抓住
They're filling them up faster than I can bring them to holding.

296
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,880
發生什麼事?
What happened?

297
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,030
我的人去抓人 他們反抗 我叫了增援
My men went to make arrests, people started resisting, I called for reinforcements.

298
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,210
知道誰是煽動者嗎?
Do you know who the instigators are?

299
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,460
不知道任何跡象和原因
There's no rhyme or reason I can tell.

300
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,590
沒收手機
Confiscate the cell phones.

301
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,070
找到信息來源 就能抓到元兇
When we get to the origins of the text message, you'll have your ringleaders.

302
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,130
還在通知家人 審訊大部分鬧事者
They're still notifying families and processing most of the rioters.

303
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,290
Garcia查到什麼了嗎?
Did garcia come up with anything?

304
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,590
有 她已經找到了最早收到信息的兩台手機
Yeah. She was able to isolate the first 2 cell phones in the chain.

305
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,320
警探 我們認為不明嫌犯不在其中
Detective,we don't think our unsubs are in there,

306
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,820
但還是想審訊有可能的元兇
but we'd still like to interrogate the possible ringleaders.

307
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,950
我不認為
I don't think so.

308
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,450
但我們需要徹底排除嫌疑
But we need to eliminate them absolutely as suspects.

309
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,040
我們自己可以處理
We can handle it on our own.

310
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,650
我們不是說你們不行
We're not saying you can't.

311
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,400
有問題嗎?
Is there a problem?

312
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,920
你讓我的人徹底搜查酒吧找成年人
You guys had my men out there canvassing bars looking for adults

313
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,800
我們本來可以查查流氓和少年犯罪記錄
when I could have been doing gang sweeps,going through juvenile records.

314
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,260
那是在浪費時間
That would have been a waste of your time.

315
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,360
你們沒注意吧 外面的那些都是孩子
In case you hadn't noticed, those are kids out there.

316
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,280
我們認為昨晚的暴亂與謀殺無關
We don't believe last night's riot is connected to the murders.

317
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,600
怎麼可能沒關係?
How could it not be?

318
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,650
因為我們要找的不明嫌犯年紀更大
Because the unsubs we're looking for are older.

319
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,150
他們只在華盛頓東南地區犯事
They operate entirely out of southeast d.c.

320
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,850
他們對受害人採取絕對控制 暴力行為非常有針對性
They exercise extreme control over their victims, and violence is up close and personal.

321
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,280
昨晚的事都不符合側寫
None of what happened here last night fits the profile.

322
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,230
別再說側寫了 我可能損失了一百萬
Enough with the profile. I got probably a million dollars worth of damage.

323
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,800
兩名警員受傷了
I got two cops injured.

324
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,460
可能會因為警察反應過度變得更糟
Which was probably made worse by police overreaction.

325
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,810
什麼意思? 我警告過你
Meaning what? I warned you.

326
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,190
這種案子會讓人更情緒化
Cases like this, people get too emotional.

327
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,580
在我的部門 你們都是客人
You're here as a guest of my department.

328
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,410
我們只是想幫忙
We're only trying to help.

329
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,400
如果你們確定這些孩子都不是兇手 為什麼還要審訊他們?
If you're so sure none of those kids are the killers, why bother interrogating them at all?

330
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,570
因為我們要確定
Because we need to be certain.

331
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,640
如果我們是對的  如果這只是孩子們的挑釁行為
If we're right, if this is just some sort of teenage dare,

332
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,020
我保證 不明嫌犯會很快做出反應
I guarantee you that the unsubs are going to respond very quickly.

333
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,040
真謝謝你看透了這些  但之後我們想自己接手了
I appreciate your insight, but we'd like to take things from here on our own.

334
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,820
謝謝你們所做的一切
Thank you for everything you've done.

335
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,180
你們可以從這兩個人開始問
You're gonna want to start with these 2 names.

336
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,160
你幫不了我 我想和負責的警官說
You're not helping. I want to speak to the officer in charge.

337
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,800
Barnes女士
Ms.barnes.

338
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,690
我想知道發生什麼事了
I need someone to tell me what's going on.

339
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,430
我們正在查
We're trying to figure it out.

340
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,520
是他們殺了William嗎?
Are those the ones who killed william?

341
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,550
不是他們 但是他們引起暴動
No,they're not. But they started the riot.

342
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,140
他們只是一群傻孩子
They're just a bunch of stupid kids.

343
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,050
對 打砸搶 隨意襲擊路人的 不正是他們嗎
Yeah,who vandalize and attack people at random.

344
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,160
我說過 這樣的事情都有內部力量
I told you these things have their own momentum.

345
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,550
你確定嗎? 我很抱歉
Are you sure? I'm sorry.

346
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,320
都玩開心了嗎? 都出人命了 你們不管嗎?
So did you all have fun,huh? Do you even care that someone died?

347
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,880
Barnes女士 你需要冷靜
Ms.barnes,you really need to calm down.

348
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,400
不 沒人在乎 不是這樣的
No,no one cares. That's not true.

349
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,780
沒人在乎 有人死了 難道這只是遊戲嗎 只是工作嗎? 過後就忘?
No one cares. Someone dies and it's all just a game or a job and everyone just moves on.

350
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,000
不是的 人們在乎 我也在乎
That's not true. People do care,and I care.

351
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,490
他們毫無緣由地殺了我哥哥
They killed my brother for no reason!

352
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,970
拜託 我送你出去 呼吸下新鮮空氣.
Please. Let me walk you outside and get you some air. Please.

353
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,530
跟我走 沒事的
Walk with me. It's ok.

354
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,590
沒事的
It's all right.

355
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,170
我進入了你指定區域警報服務台
I've logged into police dispatch for the area you've isolated.

356
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,860
如果有人報案的話 我們能馬上知道
If anything's reported, we'll know when they know.

357
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,670
等等 我們還在做這個案子?
Wait,are we staying on the case?

358
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,760
我們知道不明嫌犯會對昨晚的暴動有所反應
We all know that these unsubs are gonna react to last night's riot.

359
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,660
但是Emily說的對 他們叫我們別管了
But emily's right. They asked us to step aside.

360
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,720
Andrews是個好警察 只是現在太情緒化了
Andrews is a good cop. He's just too emotional right now.

361
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,680
不管他同不同意 如果我們不跟進  他和我們都會後悔的
If we don't stay on,with or without his permission, he and all the rest of us will regret it.

362
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,030
Morgan呢?
Where's morgan?

363
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,310
他和Barnes女士在一起
Uh,he's with ms. Barnes.

364
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,410
你確定你沒事嗎?
You sure you're gonna be all right?

365
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,990
我沒瘋 真的
You know,i'm not crazy, really.

366
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,000
Tamara 你遭受了巨大的打擊 又想早日得到真相
Tamara,you've been through a trauma, and you're processing a lot.

367
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,490
所以有點失常是正常的
It's normal to lose it a little.

368
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,020
謝謝 你所做的一切
Thank you. For everything.

369
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,810
我只是在做我的工作 不 你..
I'm just doing my job. No,you're...

370
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,380
你是好人
You're a good person.

371
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,000
那這會怎麼結束呢?
So how's this gonna end?

372
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,120
什麼?
What?

373
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,930
調查 我是說 會發生什麼呢?
The investigation. I mean,what happens?

374
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,660
如果一定要猜 昨晚的暴動 不明嫌犯不會高興的
Well,if I had to guess, last night's riotsour unsubs aren't gonna like it.

375
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,750
這是他們一致性
This is their whole identity.

376
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,790
他們不喜歡被人搶風頭
They're not gonna like sharing the attention.

377
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,010
那麼又有人要喪命了
So more people are gonna die.

378
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,930
他們只在那個地區殺人 我們的側寫很可靠
They're killing in a small area. Our profile is solid.

379
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,830
會有人認出他們
Somebody will recognize them.

380
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,580
你知道沒那麼容易的
You don't think it's gonna be that easy.

381
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,410
我真的要回去了
I really need to get back to my team.

382
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,210
對 抱歉 謝謝你... 送我回來
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thank you for,uh, driving me home.

383
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,210
不用謝
You're welcome.

384
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,440
Morgan探員
Agent morgan.

385
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,020
你認為能抓到他們嗎?
Do you think you can get these guys?

386
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,850
我們正在接近他們
We're closing in.

387
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,940
他們一定感受到了
And they're bound to start feeling it.

388
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,960
這些人 當他們發現有追兵了 就很有可能借警方之手自殺
See,guys like this, when they feel trapped, they most likely commit suicide by cop.

389
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,140
好
Good.

390
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
他媽的你們想去哪?
Where the hell do you think you're going?

391
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,360
我和社區巡警談過
I talked to the beat cops.

392
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,970
他們已通知當地經營場所留意
They're getting word out to local businesses to keep an eye out for anyone

393
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,630
那些對昨晚暴動情緒激動的人
who seems agitated by the news of last night's riot.

394
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,550
現在Andrews肯定知道那些孩子 不是不明嫌犯了
By now,andrews has to know that none of those kids are the unsubs.

395
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,600
他一定會加強東南區的警力
Then he's bound to beef up police presence in the southeast.

396
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,960
我們也應該去
We should be there,too.

397
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,870
我們反應越迅速越有利
The faster we can react, the more we can help.

398
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,610
你覺得不明嫌犯知道暴動了嗎?
Do you think the unsubs know about the riot?

399
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,400
頭版新聞 沒理由看不到
Front page news. I don't know how they can't.

400
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,730
如果側寫正確呢?
And if the profile's right?

401
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,550
他們會迅速反擊 而且手段殘暴
Their reaction's gonna be quick and it's gonna be brutal.

402
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,640
基本上是說 知道要閃電了
Basically,it's like knowing that lightning is gonna strike

403
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,130
卻不知道會擊中哪
but not being able to pinpoint where.

404
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,060
3杯
3 drafts.

405
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,960
抱歉 你不能把這個帶進來
I'm sorry,you can't have that in here.

406
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,500
什麼? 這個?
What? This?

407
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,540
這是責任問題 避免別人受傷
It's a liability issue, that's all, in case somebody gets hurt.

408
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,680
沒問題
No problem.

409
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,730
能談談麼? 可以 怎麼回事?
Can we have a talk? Yeah. What's up?

410
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,830
呃 我首先要說我愛你
Uh,first I would like to say that I love you,

411
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,910
我... 我...我愛你 正是因為你很關心別人...
and iithe thing I love the most about you is how much you care about people

412
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,980
Garcia 幹嘛? 怎麼回事?
garcia,what?What's going on?

413
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,880
我覺得你應該和Tamara Barnes切斷聯繫
I think you need to cut contact with tamara barnes.

414
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,250
我沒有和她聯繫 她當時就在警察局
I didn't make contact with her. She was at the police station.

415
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,850
好吧 看著我的眼睛 告訴我這個案子 最近有突破的時候 你不是直奔向她
Yeah,ok,look me in the eye and tell me that the first break in this case you don't run right to her

416
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,310
親自告訴她消息
and give her the news yourself.

417
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,100
Penelope 她失去了兄弟 她只想知道答案
Penelope,she lost her brother. She just wants answers.

418
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,130
明白了 那我自願去安慰這些家庭
I get it. I volunteer counseling these families.

419
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,130
我知道她需要熬過什麼
I know what she's going through.

420
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,150
那這又是唱的哪出戲?
Then where is this coming from?

421
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,170
好吧 我們就拋開道德不談 因為那一說就長篇大論了
Ok,let's just ignore the whole ethical dilemma, 'cause that's just too,too big.

422
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,060
如果你要為此案作證
And if you were to testify on this case,

423
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,430
若有人找出你和受害者家人有牽扯
the whole thing would unravel if anyone were to find out that

424
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,760
整個事情都會敗露 喔哦 停下
you're involved with a member of the victim's family. Whoa,stop.

425
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,730
你知道我愛你 也尊重你
I love you, and I respect you. You know that.

426
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,150
但現在你太過分了
But right now you're way out of bounds.

427
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,090
我沒有牽扯進去
I'm not involved.

428
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:48,280
整個小組都在這媬鴟 而你卻和她在一起
The team is here working on a case, and you're with her.

429
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,060
你牽扯進去了
You're involved.

430
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,250
告訴你吧 她在車站迷路  所以我開車送她回家
For your information, she lost it back at the station, so I drove her home.

431
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,610
句號 但對她來說不是
End of story. But not for her.

432
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,950
Derek 她很悲傷 很煩惱 很憤怒
Derek, she's so sad and so confused and angry

433
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,260
正四處尋求別人的懷抱 讓事情好轉
and desperately looking for anyone to swoop in and make it all better,

434
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,510
除非你一直待在她的身邊  伴她度過悲傷的每個階段
and unless you're all in and can be there for every stage of the grieving process,

435
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,980
否則你是她對這個世界 不信任的又一因素
you're just another reason for her to not trust the world.

436
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,320
她只是想知道為什麼而已
She's simply trying to understand why this happened.

437
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,560
並沒有為什麼 她只會拚命去找尋理由
There is no why, and she'll make herself crazy trying to find one.

438
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,990
別說是...
Don't tell me.

439
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,180
東南區的酒吧 兩人死亡 他們在等你
Bar in southeast,2 dead. They're waiting for you.

440
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,790
我得走了 是的
I got to go. Yeah.

441
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,590
你在這媟F什麼?
What are you doing here?

442
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,690
警探們 我們可以遲點再談此事
Detective,we can argue about this later.

443
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,240
現在此處是犯罪現場 我們是來幫忙的
Right now you have a crime scene and we're here to help.

444
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,960
他們先把酒保的雙手釘在吧檯上
They nailed the bartender's hands to the bar first.

445
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,900
其他人更容易逃跑
Other bastard got off easier.

446
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,040
他們赤手毆打他
They just plain beat him.

447
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,230
真煩死了 我們明明是對的 卻不起作用
I'm getting real sick of us being right and it just not mattering.

448
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,150
怪了 什麼?
This is weird. What?

449
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,190
不明嫌犯身體很強壯
The unsubs are extremely physical.

450
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,170
他們用鈍物無情地毆打受害者
They beat their victims mercilessly with blunt objects.

451
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,090
為什麼這些釘子沒有釘到底?
Why aren't these nails pounded in?

452
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,650
可能用的是釘槍
Probably used a nail gun.

453
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,730
隨著社區的翻新和新房的售出
With all the gentrification and turnover in housing in the neighborhood,

454
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,870
最近什麼最常見?
what's a common sight these days?

455
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,450
施工人員 承包商 建築工人
Builders, contractors,and construction workers.

456
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,040
顯而易見
We wouldn't give it a second thought.

457
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,990
等等
Wait a minute.

458
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:35,300
第一起 入室殺害4人 我一直想不明白
Killing 4 people in that first home invasionthat never made sense to me.

459
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,210
不明嫌犯需要進化過程
Unsubs build to something like that.

460
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,390
如果那不是他們第一次謀殺呢?
What if this wasn't their first murder?

461
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,390
先是幾起故意破壞 有代表性的破壞
The first two rounds of vandalism, they were typical.

462
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,010
砸車窗 砸飯店的玻璃
Car windows smashed, restaurants with the plate glass broken.

463
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:54,280
但是最後一起 就在入室之前 是隨意挑選的工地
But that last case, right before the home invasion, that was a random construction site.

464
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,200
獨戶住宅
A singlefamily townhouse.

465
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,650
Prentiss 你自己找出的 是的
Prentiss,you flagged it yourself. Yeah,yeah.

466
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,360
嘿 Garcia
Hey,garcia.

467
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,080
我要那戶被洗劫的公寓地址
I need the address on that townhouse that was vandalized.

468
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,100
我不明白 我們能怎麼幫忙
I don't understand how we can help.

469
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,090
先生 我們相信破壞你們房子的人 就是製造這區域謀殺案的人
Sir,we believe that whoever vandalized your house is responsible for the murders in the area.

470
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,590
噢 我知道 我們在報紙上讀到過
Oh,i know. We've read the papers.

471
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,630
但老實說 我們不想再提及此事
But,honestly,that's not something we're gonna think about right now.

472
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:21,130
我們還認為  你的房子遭到破壞是有原因的
We also think it's possible that your home was vandalized for a reason.

473
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,890
什麼意思?
What do you mean?

474
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,810
我們能進來麼?
May we?

475
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,900
可以 請進 謝謝
Yes,please. Thank you.

476
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,070
我們相信在警方發現第一起謀殺案之前 還有另外一宗謀殺案
We believe there may have been another murder before the first one the police became aware of.

477
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,860
你們認為有屍體藏在這  在我們的房子?
You think there might be a body hidden here, on our property?

478
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,830
有可能 至少我們要找的人 可能在這堣u作過
It's possible. At the very least, the men we're looking for may have worked here.

479
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,860
噢 天哪
Oh,my god.

480
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,910
在施工期間 工人們有沒有吵架?
Were there any issues with workers during construction?

481
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,140
不 沒有 有誰過度反抗嗎?
No,nothing. Did anyone appear overly confrontational?

482
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,920
我只和承包商聯繫 他為人友善
I just had contact with our contractor, and he was friendly.

483
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,020
我明白 施工期間 人來人往
I understand people come and go during construction,

484
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,540
但你們有注意到誰突然消失了嗎?
but was there anyone at all that you may have noticed suddenly wasn't around?

485
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,840
噢 不 什麼事?
Oh,no. What is it?

486
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,850
我提到的承包商...
The contractor I mentioned...

487
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,160
房子造到破壞後 我打電話叫他維修
After the vandalism, we called him to oversee the repairs.

488
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,760
他一直沒回電話
He never called us back.

489
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,820
警方報告上稱 所有房間都被砸壞 唯獨一間倖免
The police report said that every room in the house was destroyed except one.

490
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,140
是的 除了嬰兒房 其他都被砸 他們沒碰那房間
Yeah,they smashed every room except the nursery. That one they didn't touch.

491
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,550
我們得看看
We need to see it.

492
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,630
這牆是撐大梁的
This wall is structural.

493
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,750
如果不是因為非常重要 我不會如此請求
I wouldn't ask you this unless I felt it was incredibly important.

494
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,930
我需要打開這面牆 不行
I need to open up this wall. No.

495
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,800
如果不知道真相 我們怎麼能住得下去
We can't live here and not know.

496
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,990
女士 我發誓 即使要我親手動手
Ma'am, I promise you,even if I have to do every bit of the work myself,

497
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,900
都會將這面牆修好 和之前的一模一樣
this wall will be repaired and it'll go right back to being exactly what you want.

498
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,180
求你了? 好吧
Please? Ok.

499
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,210
我是FBI的Emily Prentiss探員
This is agent emily prentiss with the fbi.

500
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,120
請派個SCSI小組過來
I need an scsi unit.

501
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,440
發現屍體
We've got a body.

502
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,220
待不下去了
I can't be here.

503
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,970
我們借一步說話
Let's move over here.

504
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,500
你們有地方落腳嗎?
Is there someplace the two of you can stay?

505
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,830
是的 我可以打電話給朋友
Yes. We have friends I can call.

506
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,390
警方給你們錄完口供後  會送你們去朋友家
After you give the police a statement, they can take you to your friends' house.

507
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,930
謝謝
Thank you.

508
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,680
覺得他們能挺得過嗎?
You think they'll be ok?

509
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,660
不知道呀 你看  重新裝修了你的夢想家園
I don't know.I mean,you redo your dream home,

510
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,040
準備開始全新的生活 然後發生這個?
about to start a new chapter of your life, and then this?

511
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,210
你怎麼知道的?
How did you know?
