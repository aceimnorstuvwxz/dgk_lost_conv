I just got them. What's so important you couldn't send it to the rest of the team?

59
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,730
所有受害人身上都有傷痕 他喜歡捆綁
All the women are connected by marks.

60
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,990
一定是性虐待狂
Definite sexual sadist.

61
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,910
兇手遵循套路 都是16至19歲的金髮女
He sticks to his type. 16to 19yearold girls, all blond.

62
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,510

Hangs on to them for a while,too. Look at this.

Average of 2 years between abducting them and killing them.

64
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,750
殺害人數少 禁錮時間長  這個兇手很有自制力
Low body count, long time frame. This guy's in control of his urges.

65
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,070
也太自製了 虐待狂期盼新的被虐者 喜歡以新的方式折磨她們
Too controlled. Sadists need new victims, new ways to torture.

66
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,240
很多傢伙都喜歡捆綁
There are a lot of guys out there who like chains.

67
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,710
我們能確定這是同一個不明嫌犯嗎?
Are we sure this is the same unsub?

68
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,010
Kristie Taylor的驗屍報告還顯示 這些受害人之間的另一個相同之處
Kristie taylor's autopsy report also indicates a second connection between these victims.

她懷孕了 還生過孩子

生完沒過多久 不明嫌犯就殺了她
Very soon after, the unsub killed her.

71
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,680
有多久? 幾分鐘後
How soon after? Minutes.

72
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,410
這個不明嫌犯不是典型的性虐待狂
This unsub isn't your typical sexual sadist.

73
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,760

Captivity and assault we've seen before.What we haven't seen is this signature

74

"你不可能真正瞭解人性
"you don't really understand human nature

"unless you know why a child on a merrygoround "will wave at his parents every time around

80

而父母也會每次和他們招手"
and why his parents will always wave back."

81
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,760
為什麼性虐待狂會讓那些女孩 懷上他的孩子呢?
so why would a sexual sadist make womenry hhildren?

85
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,080
糟糕的處境是他們 控制欲幻想的部分原因
Squalid conditions are part of a control fantasy these men had.

86
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,780
如果他把這些女孩安置在同一地點 就需要很多私人空間
If he's keeping these women in a similar location, he'd need a lot of privacy.

87
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,590
也許他自己蓋了個地方 手一定很巧
He probably built it himself. Makes him good with his hands.

88
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,030
為什麼都是金髮 對他有什麼特殊意義?
Why blondes, and what significance do they have to him?

89
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,710
也許是 嗯 拒絕過他的女人 或是不願懷上他孩子的女人?
Maybe,uh,the woman who rejected him or the woman who wouldn't bear his children?

90
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,610
如果是這樣 他就應該 和這些女孩同齡 不過20來歲
If that were true,he'd be the same age as these girlslate teens.

91
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,780
可這個不明嫌犯手法太老道了
This unsub is too skilled for that.

92
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,970
那就是他母親?
His own mother,then?

93
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,950
她可能也是個逃犯 和這些受害人一樣
She could be a runaway, just like these victims.

94
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,630
這就孕育了他的強迫心理
Which makes his compulsion psych 101

95
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,970
一次又一次地殺了她 就因為她生下他
killing his mother over and over again for giving birth to him.

96
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,500
是啊 可為什麼要等到她生完呢?
Yeah,but then why wait until after she gives birth?

97
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,990
這下他就要搞定一個大人一個孩子了
Now he has a body and a baby to get rid of.

98
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,210
我也很疑惑 我們只找到了母親 卻沒發現嬰兒
,toyeah,but then why wait untiwe found the mothersrth? But not the infants.

99
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,790
呃 我實在不想這麼說 可如果這些女孩 只是他達到最終目的的工具呢?
Uh,i hate to say this, but what if the women are just a means to an end?

100
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,950
如果他要的其實是那些孩子呢?
What if the babies are really the ones he's exploiting?

101
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,610
如果Kristie Taylor是才被發現的 也就是說孩子現在還在他手
If kristie taylor just surfaced, it means he has her baby right now.

Jj,check with the parents.

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,350
看看她們的在逃之間有沒有相同之處 看看不明嫌犯是在哪綁走她們
See if there are any similarities in the runaways' patterns, where the unsub's finding them.

104

Reid和Prentiss 去最近發現的棄屍點
Reid and prentiss, go to the latest dump site.

105
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,470
我們要好好研究被害者類型
We need to look at victimology.

106
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,740
查出她們臨死前他是怎麼做的
How he treats these women in the final moments of their lives

107
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,810
或許能知道他對那些孩子有什麼企圖
might tell us what he's doing to the children.

108

<i>新墨西哥州 阿爾伯克基</i>

109
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,230
大夫 你的報告上說Kristie流產過好幾次
Doctor,you wrote in your report that kristie had had several miscarriages.

110
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,480
這是怎麼發現的?
How was that evident?

111
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,190
她子宮內壁有好幾處磨損
There were a number of abrasions in her uterine lining.

112
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,710
大概6 7個月時 她的羊水就會破了
Around the third trimester, her water would break.

113
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,570
這麼說她都沒能生下來?
So she never carried to term?

114
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,280
不 最後一次她生下來了
No,last time she did.

115
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,290
她血液中催產素的含量非常高
There was a high level of pitocin in her blood.

116
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,580
那是種人工荷爾蒙 能誘發分娩
It's an artificial hormone. You give it to induce labor.

117
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,320
就是說她被催得很緊?
She was on a tight schedule?

118
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,730
如果孩子流掉了 他就立即再讓她懷上
If she lost the baby, he would get her pregnant again immediately.

119
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,380
生孩子已經夠痛苦的了
Childbirth is tough enough.

120
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,530
更別說把自己的命懸在這上面
Imagine if your life depends upon it.

121
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,130
3個母親都有前科  濫用藥物 酗酒 精神紊亂
All 3 moms had records. Drug abuse, drunk and disorderlies.

122
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,820
不過更有意思的 是她們被綁架後的事
But what's more interesting is what he does after he kidnaps them.

123
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,750
這是Kristie Taylor被綁架2周前
This is kristie taylor 2 weeks before she was abducted.

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,540
他幫助她恢復了健康  保持營養 戒掉了壞習慣
He got her healthy. Wellfed and off the habit.

125
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,620
沒完全戒掉
Not completely.

126
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,150
Kristie體內的這些藥物是什麼?
These drugs in kristie's systemwhat are they?

127
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,990
它莫西芬 胃復安 多潘立酮 黃體酮
Tamoxifen,metoclopramide, domperidone,progesterone.

128
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,310
黃體酮是產前藥物 是嗎?
Progesterone's a prenatal medication,isn't it?

129
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,160
以上都是 頭兩種幫助保住胎兒
They all are. The first 2 help carry the baby to term.

130
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,590
後兩種幫助分泌乳汁
The last 2 help with lactation.

131
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,360
什麼樣的性虐待狂 會給受害人服用產前藥物?
Exual sadist gives his victims prenatal drugs?

132
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,810
想要照看孩子的性虐待狂
The kind who takes care of the kids he's having.

133
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,450
他殺了母親 卻非常保護孩子
He gets his rocks off killing the moms, but the babies he protects.

134
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,280
你認為他把孩子留在了身邊?
You think he's keeping them?

135
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,420
如果他拋棄母親 也會拋棄孩子
If he despises the moms, he'd despise their children,too.

136
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,990
新墨西哥地處國界
New mexico's right on the border.

137
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,700
活動著許多人口販子
A lot of human trafficking going on.

138
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,580
既然他讓母親的懷孕節奏這麼快 說明他在繁衍自己的後代
This tight schedule he keeps the moms onhe could be breeding.

139
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,950
打電話給兒童保護組織
Call child protection services.

140
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,150
我們要找出現存的嬰兒販賣黑市
We need to find out about existing black markets for infants.

141
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,520
謝謝
Thank you.

142
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,340
這沒有輪胎印
There's no tire tracks.

143
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,130
屍體並沒有丟在離大路很遠的地方
The body wasn't dumped that far from the road.

144
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,300
這傢伙跟本不在乎別人看見  都不花功夫把屍體藏好點
This guy doesn't care about them, not enough to even hide them very well.

145
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,810
所以沒道理啊
That's why this doesn't make any sense.

146
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,280
不明嫌犯的棄屍點 其實很能說明問題的
Dump sites reveal something about the unsub,you know?

147
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,170
至少 從地點熟悉度來看  他知道自己在這個地方不會被抓
At the very least, a geographic familiarity, a place he knows he won't get caught.

148
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,460
好 這麼說他對這條路很熟
Ok,so he knows this road.

149
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,390
對 可他是在法明頓綁架Kristie的 卻把她扔到了媊鶿
Yeah,except he abducted kristie in farmington and then dumps her here in rio rancho.

150
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,020
相距175英里

151
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,330
開車那麼久 就為把她扔路邊?
Why drive that far just to dump a body by the side of the road?

152
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,410
反偵查策略? 用長距離掩蓋輪胎印?
A forensic countermeasure? Covering his tracks by sheer distance?

153
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,040
所以說關於地理位置的側寫 沒多大幫助
So the geographical profile won't do us much good.

154
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,380
不 還是有幫助的 只是和受害人無關
No,it will, wi the victims.

155
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,940
據我們的側寫 他感興趣的是孩子
We profiled that it's the babies that he's interested in.

156
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,690
他會在這點上暴露自己
That's where he'll reveal himself.

157
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,870
通過他販賣孩子的收養機構 和使用的渠道網絡
The adoption company he sells through and whatever network of resources he uses.

158
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,390
他會圖方便走捷徑
He makes shortcuts there for convenience.

159
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,210
沒人會開車到100英里外買尿布 或者填寫一張出生公證
No one's gonna drive 100 miles for diapers or for a public notary for legal paperwork.

160
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,600
如果孩子記錄在案 就能找到他
If the babies are in the system, they'll lead us to him.

161
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,980
販賣兒童在其他國家很猖獗  不過在這兒 倒是不常見
Child trafficking is huge in other countries, but here it's mostly a myth.

162
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,430
<i>新墨西哥州 阿爾伯克基 兒童保護組織</i>

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,130
為什麼?
Why is that?

164
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,930
因為有更簡單合法的途徑收養
There's an easier and legal pathadoption.

165
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,790
會有文件記錄的對不對?
There'd be a paper trail, though,wouldn't there?

166
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,120
要匿名也是有辦法的
There are ways to hide your tracks.

167
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,640
一定有辦法能查到所有孩子
There must be a way to identify all these kids.

168
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,460
每宗收養都有法庭記錄
There's a court record for every adoption.

169
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,190
把記錄給我們 我們先按時間篩選
Give us the records. We'll start weeding them out by date.

170
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,920
本州的收養案件都是保密的
The adoptions in this state are closed.

171
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,350
資料都封好了 要花點時間
The files are sealed. So it'll take time.

172
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,060
我們等不起
That's a luxury we don't have.

173
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,500
眼下有個孩子正處於危險之中
There's a child at risk right now.

174
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,570
所有走過收養程序的孩子
All children who go in and out of the adoption system

175
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,820
都作過出生前基因狀況檢查
get basic genetic screenings for preexisting conditions.

176
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,690
我們這有他們的DNA記錄
We have their dna.

177
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,920
這個也行 我們可以把母親的DNA 和他們的作對比
We can use that. We can match the maternal dna with the babies in the system.

178
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,170
即使這樣也還有好幾百個孩子
We're still talking hundreds of kids.

179
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,290
我們把其中一個孩子的DNA給你們呢?
Uofhe b iies' dna?

180
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,650
那樣就快多了
That would make it go faster,yeah.

181
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,320
這些母親生完孩子後馬上就被他殺了
He kills these moms so soon after they give birth,

182
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,980
屍體上很可能還殘留孩子的DNA
secondary dna could still be on their bodies.

183
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,710
我聯繫法醫
I'll call the m.E.

184
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,350
我理解 謝謝您 大夫
I understand. Thank you,doctor.

185
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,970
Jareau探員?
Agent jareau?

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,520
我是Conrad Winmar 這是我太太Jane
I'm conrad winmar. This is my wife jane.

187
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,190
謝謝你們過來
Thank you for coming in.

188
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,220
我們進房間談好嗎?
Why don't we talk privately?

189
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,180
你你想瞭解我們的女兒?
Youyou want to dig up our daughter?

190
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,230
我們認為不明嫌犯也許 在她體內留下了DNA
We think the unsub might have left dna on her.

191
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,070
雖然上兩個受害者沒有
The last 2 victims didn't have any,

192
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,060
但考慮到Monica是第一個 他也許會犯錯
but because monica was the first, he might have made a mistake.

193
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,490
警方發現她的時候 說沒發現兇手的DNA
Back when they found her, the detectives said that they did not find his dna.

194
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,320
我們找的不是他的DNA
It's not his dna we're looking for.

195
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,130
我們懷疑你們的女兒 在被綁架期間生過孩子
We suspect your daughter gave birth while she was captive.

196
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,810
什麼?
What?

197
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,500
不明嫌犯讓所有的受害人都懷孕了
The unsub has gotten all of his victims pregnant.

198
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,310
他也許把孩子送去了收養機構
He might be putting the babies in the adoption system.

199
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,220
孩子還活著? 有可能
The baby's alive? Possibly.

200
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,940
如果我們能找到Monica的胎盤組織
If we could find placental tissue on monica,

201
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,250
我們就可以對其進行DNA檢測並與 州記錄比對
we can test the dna against the state's records.

202
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,080
請授權給我們
Give us the release.

203
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,440
我第一次看見她的同時 也看了她的檔案
The first time i saw her, saw her record,too.

204
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,690
以為她就是那些街頭遊蕩的女孩之一 根本不在乎如何對待自己(的生命)
Thought she was just another girl on the street, t t she did to herself.

205
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,510
我甚至根本沒有想過要查這個
I never even thought to look for this.

206
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,450
這是什麼? 這是嬰兒的臍帶
What is it? It's a baby's umbilical cord.

207
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,920
那孩子現在該四歲左右了
The child should be about 4 now.

208
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,990
我希望你能找到"他"或"她" 真的
I hope you find him or her. I really do.

209
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,170
謝謝你
Thank you.

210
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,850
好 大家都知道 大多數收養孩子的人 幾乎都是世界上最善良和無私的
Ok,know thismost adoption folk are like the nicest, most dedicated people in the world.

211
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,450
但是也會有極個別 齷齪下流低級那種人
There are,however, one or two skeezy ones.

212
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,180
有多齷齪下流低級? 超級齷齪下流低級
How skeezy? Super skeezy.

213
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,860
我這有其中一人發的傳單 要求因為收養的孩子得到報酬
I've got a spread sheet from one of them expecting compensation for the baby i'm having.

214
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,590
你還有什麼要告訴我的嗎 Garcia?
Something you want to tell me,garcia?

215
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,710
哦 說來傷感 我的王子
Oh,that's the sad part, my prince.

216
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,630
有你我完美遺傳基因的寶寶 可賣不上個好價錢
The genetically perfect offspring of penelope garcia and derek morgan wouldn't fetch top dollar.

217
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,380
什麼樣的賣得上? 與有色人種相比 白人嬰兒供不應求
Who does? White babies are in higher demand than minorities.

218
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,550
男孩比女孩更受歡迎  反正至少今年是
Boys are more popular than girls, at least this year,anyway.

219
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,770
然後還有和瑞典選超模一樣的標準
And then there's the swedish supermodel rule.

220
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,810
什麼?
The what?

221
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,970
如果我成功生下金髮藍眼的娃兒 我人生就別無所求了 真的 
If i were to deliver a blondhaired,blueeyed bundle of joy, i'd be set for life. I would.

222
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,920
Garcia 新墨西哥州領養記錄媯o現 和嬰兒的DNA匹配的了嗎?
Garcia, did the baby's dna turn up in new mexico's adoption records?

223
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,070
沒 沒有和她的資料匹配的 順便說一下 那是個女孩
No. There's no hits on her profile. And it is a her, by the way.

224
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,520
不明疑犯很可能還在出售嬰兒 只是沒有通過官方渠道
This unsub could still be selling babies, just not through the system.

225
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,740
這也讓抓他的難度更大了
That's gonna make him a lot harder to catch.

226
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,820
好了 不早了 大家都去休息吧 明兒一大早我們再議
All right. It's late. Let's get some rest. We'll hit this fresh in the morning.

227
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,740
Garcia撤了
Garcia out.

228
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,020
Morgan 我希望你提出 一份書面的初步側寫
Morgan. I'd like for you to write up a preliminary profile.

229
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,990
我們掌握的還不夠
We don't have enough for that.

230
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,640
對 所以才是初步側寫
Well,that's why it's preliminary.

231
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,470
進一步側寫過程中 我們能知道漏掉了什麼
A work in progress profile helps show us what we're missing.

232
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,310
好的 沒問題
Ok. Sure.

233
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,440
你現在感覺怎樣?
How you holding up?

234
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,900
我們剛浪費了一整天去查 一個可能不存在的黑市
We just wasted a day looking into a black market that probably doesn't exist.

235
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,010
我不是問這個 我聽說 你受到不少壓力 
At's nothat i mean. I've heard whispers. You're getting some heat.

236
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,090
我正在妥善處理
I'm taking care of it.

237
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,930
所以 你覺得我們在這個問題上 想得狹隘了?
So,you,uh,think we have a tunnel vision problem?

238
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,840
我覺得 我們當然願意相信 自己可以救那些孩子
I think we'd like to believe that we could save those kids,

239
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,410
但 看看他是怎麼對那些母親的
but look what he does to the mothers.

240
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,650
極大的憤怒
A lot of anger.

241
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,360
他很可能也對孩子下了同樣的毒手
He's probably doing the same thing to the children.

242
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,300
他自己的孩子
His own children.

243
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,070
也許
Maybe.

244
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,040
Garcia提供了很有意思的信息
Garcia said something interesting.

245
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,170
金髮藍眼嬰兒在收養中能要高價
Blondhaired,blueeyed babies get top dollar in the adoption system.

246
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,410
所有的母親都是...
All the mothers...

247
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,310
金髮藍眼
Have blond hair and blue eyes.

248
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,940
這你一定會滿意的 這人再好不過了
You're gonna love this. This guy, he has like the best.

249
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,970
誰也比不上
Like there is no better.

250
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,120
他就像是能通上帝
He has like this access to god.

251
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,900
他不想獨佔 想奉獻
He doesn't want to hang on to it. He wants to give it away.

252
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,980
還有多遠? 就快到了
How much further? Not much.

253
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,470
那就是上帝之愛的意義 你知道的 是分享
Because that's what god's love is, you know,it's sharing.

254
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,700
是無私奉獻不求回報
It's giving everything you have of yourself away and not expecting anything in return.

255
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,610
我們到哪了?
Where are we?

256
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,460
就這 寶貝 就是我們要來的地方
Right here,baby, right where we need to be.

257
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,220
她成吧 是吧? 這是你要找到那種妞吧?
She's good,right? That's the kindof y?

258
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,960
她很完美
She's perfect.

259
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,860
我知道希望渺茫 但Monica的父母 說她之前正要去西部
I know it's a long shot, but monica's parents said that she was heading west.

260
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,200
也許她被綁架時 已經按計劃走了部分旅程了
Maybe she made it part of the way when she was kidnapped.

261
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,790
何不把她的DNA和 周圍幾個州的領養記錄比對一下?
So why not run her dna against adoption records in surrounding states?

262
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,010
你在開玩笑嗎? 你老有才了
Are you kidding? I think you're.

263
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,780
嘿 JJ 如果我們找到這個小姑娘 她會怎麼樣?
Hey,jj,if we find this little girl, what's gonna happen to her?

264
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,570
如果在領養的過程中有非法操作
If something illegal transpires the adoption process,

265
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,550
法庭會將其判為無效  孩子會交還給最近的血親
whatthe court nullifies it, the child gets returned to the closest blood relative.

266
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,650
告訴你一句吧 我見過她祖父母了 
If it helps, i have met with the grandparents.

267
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,240
他們人都非常好
They're wonderful ople.

268
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,020
哦 我相信他們一定是 我只是...
Oh,i'm sure they are. It's just...

269
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,750
我也不知道 我... 我父母都不在了
I don't know,i... I lost my parents.

270
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,600
當然了 父母走的時候 我比她大
Granted,i was older than she is,but...

271
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,530
但... 讓我撐過去的 是我身邊至親的人

272
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,400
如果Monica的女兒正生活在一個 不錯的家庭 而我們把她帶走
If monica's daughter is with a good family and we take her away from them...

273
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,770
是否弊大於利? 對
Are we doing more harm than good? Yeah.

274
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,740
Garcia 我想我們沒有選擇
Garcia,i don't think we have a choice.

275
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,800
那是他們的孫女啊 他們有自己的權利
These people have a right to their granddaughter.

276
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,280
你是對的  這太難受了
You're right. This sucks.

277
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,850
是啊 請馬上 謝謝
Yes,right away,please. Thank you.

278
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,730
我打電話給兒童保護機構讓他們把 嬰兒死亡的資料送來
I just called cps, asked them to send over infant mortality files.

279
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,950
讓我們可以排除另外一種可能性 很好

280
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,200
那是什麼? 你的側寫
What's that? Your profile.

281
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,890
我不同意你的分析
I disagree with your analysis.

282
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,530
Hotch 你是認真的嗎?
Hotch,are you serious?

283
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,870
這不是回顧法律的文章 只是初步的分析 讓大家產生更多思路
It's not a law review article, t mething hfor us to brainstorm.

284
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,530
但你僅專注在一個方面 Morgan 產前用藥只顯示 有妻子或是女友的存在
But you only focused on one angle,morgan, of a wife or a girlfriend.

285
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,760
我們需要更多的建議
We need more options.

286
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,730
只要作出足夠的排除 我就能立刻向你提出
Which i can give you once we make the proper deductions.

287
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,150
Hotch 你這是讓我猜啊
hotch,you're asking me we need to guess.

288
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,570
Morgan 要使側寫能夠有用
Morgan,in order for the profile to be useful,

289
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,890
就必須要給出多種關於不明疑犯可能 正在做什麼的方案 重寫
it has to generate multiple scenarios about what the unsub is doing. Rewrite it.

290
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,060
我們找到他了 Monica Winmar的女兒
We got her. Monica winmar's daughter.

291
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,750
她四年前被人收養 現在改名叫Lisa
She was adopted 4 years ago. She's lisa now.

292
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,460
Garcia是怎麼找到她的? 不是交叉比對了 整個新墨西哥系統堛爾禤げ?
How did garcia find her? She crossreferenced the entire new mexico system.

293
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,350
她不在新墨西哥 在亞利桑那
She wasn't in new mexico. She was in arizona.

294
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,080
所有的母親都在新墨西哥被綁 被棄屍 但他把嬰兒留在亞利桑那
So all the mothers were abducted and dumped in new mexico, but he keeps the babies in arizona.

295
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,220
他知道警察會在州界停止搜索
He knows the police with stop looking at the state line.

296
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,510
領養中介機構會是我們找到 不明嫌犯的最佳途徑
The adoption agency's gonna be our best lead to the unsub.

297
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,910
領養是誰經手的? 那是第二個大意外
Who handled the case? That's bombshell number 2.

298
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,480
她不是通過中介機構被領養
she didn't go through an agency.

299
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,920
而是被不知什麼人丟在了一間教堂
She was dropped off anonymously at a church.

300
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,390
醫院和教堂是安全的天堂
Hospitals and churches are safe havens.

301
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,410
你可以把孩子丟在那  沒人會問你什麼問題 
You can drop a baby off, no questions asked.

302
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,730
兒童保護機構會尋找最直接的親屬
Child protection services would look for the closest relative.

303
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,420
但也只限於本州界內
Another search that ends at the state line.

304
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,500
如果兒童保護機構尋找未果 嬰兒就會像Lisa一樣被送去寄養
And if cps doesn't find one,the baby will go into foster care, which is what happened to lisa.

305
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,220
她是幸運的 一個月內就被領養了
She was lucky. The adoption process happened within a month.

306
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,460
不明嫌犯明明有機會 賣孩子賺錢
So,this unsub had the opportunity to make money off this infant.

307
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,230
但他卻沒有 把孩子丟在教堂 是因為他知道州政府會做妥善安排
He doesn't, drops it off at a church because he knows the state will take good care of it.

308
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,620
想得還真周到
That's awfully considerate.

309
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,830
除去殺人 不明嫌犯的任何行為 都與性虐待狂不符 和我的側寫一致
Outside the murders, nothing about this unsub's behavior profiles like a sexl dist... As i wrote.

310
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,390
嗯 Morgan說得對 這是一個照顧者 一個媽媽的行為
Yeah,morgan's right.

311
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,890
我們的不明嫌犯可能會是女性嗎?
Could our unsub be a woman?

312
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,680
呃 只有男性才會如此折磨受害者
Uh,only a man would torture his victims this much.

313
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,810
男性會沉迷於如此暴力 女性則不然
Men get off on this kind of violence. Women don't.

314
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,600
他也可能結了婚 他的妻子會被迫順從 參與照顧那些媽媽們
He could be married, though,his wife being a passive participant, taking care of the moms.

315
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,860
還有嬰兒們 沒錯 我們得分頭行動
And the babies. All right. Weeed to split up.

316
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,430
我們要分別向新墨西哥和 亞利桑那州警給出側寫
We'll give the profile he a the w mexico state police.

317
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,270
Reid Rossi Prentiss 你們趕去鳳凰城

318
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,710
Morgan你留下來和我一起完成側寫

319
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,930
你覺得怎麼樣?
how are you feeling?

320
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,240
糟透了
Terrible.

321
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,740
你是什麼問題? 什麼? 你什麼意思?
What are you on? What? What are you talking about?

322
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,070
他綁架我們的時候 大家都有點問題
When he takes us, we're all on something.

323
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,670
我是嗜酒成癮 那你是什麼問題?
I was an alcoholic. So,what are you on?

324
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,040
吸毒
Crack.

325
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,990
我叫Carol
I'm carol.

326
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,500
我叫Julie
I'm julie.

327
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,700
來 這有些水 過來喝點
Here. Here's some water. Come drink some.

328
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,450
這是那種嚴愛強制戒癮所嗎?
Is this some kind of tough love detox?

329
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,260
哦 那是怎麼回事?
Oh,what is that?

330
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,480
這就像太陽一樣 為我們補充 維生素D 讓我們保持健康
It's like the sun. It gives us vitamin d. It keeps us healthy.

331
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,210
他們不能強行把我們關在這
Well,they can't make us stay here.

332
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,730
嘿 放我出去!
Hey,let me out!

333
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,530
我要回家! 還我衣服! 還我手機!
I want to go home! I want my clothes! I want my phone!

334
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,500
讓我從這出去! 讓我出去!
Let me out of here! Let me out!

335
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,230
他幹嘛這麼做?
Why is he doing this?

336
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,950
他想要什麼?
What does he want?

337
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,780
你的孩子
Your baby.

338
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,730
我沒懷孕
I'm not pregnant.

339
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,350
你會的
You will be.

340
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,330
我們要找的不明嫌犯是一對夫婦
The unsubs that we are looking for are a couple.

341
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,470
這位男性疑犯 很可能有性暴力的歷史
Now,the man in the relationship most likely has a history of sexual violence.

342
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,480
起初是跟蹤 然後升級為襲擊和強姦
He started with stalking, and then moved his way up to assault and rape.

343
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,000
當他找到他妻子的時候 這些暴力行為暫時停止了
And that violent streak ended temporarily when he found his wife.

344
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,170
他們結婚的第一年  她向他的虐待屈服
For the first years of their marriage, 

345
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,850
去找那些反覆進出急診室 有明顯受婚後虐待徵兆的妻子
look for wives who came into the e.R.Repeatedly and with obvious signs of spousal abuse,

346
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,900
你們很可能要追溯到5年前
but you are gonna have to go back about 5 years.

347
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,220
這是因為 第一起綁架發生的時候 她就停止進出急診了
That's because around the time of the first abduction, the visits stopped.

348
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,460
性虐狂不能從自願參與的 對像身上獲得滿足
The sexual sadist can't find satisfaction from a willing participant.

349
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,890
不斷對她施暴 但終有一天 不殺死她就再無法升級
He eventually got to a place where he couldn't escalate his violence against her without killing her,

350
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,300
所以她和他達成了協議
so she made him a deal.

351
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,240
他可以綁架 強姦 殺死這些 離家出走的女孩 她則留下孩子
He gets to kidnap, rape,and kill each of the runaways, and she gets to keep the children.

352
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,070
她一直在給受害者提供 一系列的產前處方藥
She's been giving the victims a series of prescription prenatal drugs.

353
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,990
你們調查的重點應該在相關領域 護士 助產士...

354
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,690
那做妻子的需要這些孩子
The wife needs these children.

355
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,730
起初 孩子是她的生命線  保障她能活下來
At first,they were the lifeline that kept her alive.

356
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,700
只要他還有其他的虐待對像 她就能躲過他強烈的慾望
As long as he had other targets for his abuse, she avoided his rage.

357
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,100
但 如果這些孩子能保護她免受虐待 為什麼她要把他們送去被領養呢?
So if these children protect her from abuse, why is she putting them up for adoption?

358
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,270
我們相信不明嫌犯只想要 和他們長得像的孩子
We believe the unsubs want children who resemble them physically,

359
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,910
沒有人會質疑是否他們親生的孩子
who no one would question as their own.

360
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,680
所有離家出走的女孩都是金髮 也就是說不明嫌犯很可能也是
All of the runaways have been blond, which means the unsub

361
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,410
但我們在領養系統塈鋮鴘 第一個孩子是棕髮

362
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,300
不管外表上的特徵是什麼 例如  眼睛或皮膚的顏色 
e sil the color of the eyes, the skin type

363
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,650
如果孩子不具備這些  他或她最後會進入寄養體系
if the baby doesn't have it, he or she ends up in the foster care system,

364
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,850
性虐狂的妻子需要發洩途徑 作為一種逃避機制
wives of sexual sadists need outlets as a denial mechanism

365
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,580
來應付她們的伴侶的所作所為
to cope with what their partners are doing.

366
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,470
成為一個母親 特別是照顧無依無靠的 嬰兒 就是這個女人的應對方式
And motherhood, especially taking care of a helplesinfant is this woman's way of coping.

367
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,990
你找到她了? 我們找到了
We have.

368
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,560
她怎麼樣? 她很好
How is she? She's great.

369
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,490
她被一對年輕的夫婦領養了
She was adopted by a young couple.

370
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,340
沒有生理或心理創傷的報告

371
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,870
那我們什麼時候可以要回她?
So when can we take her?

372
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,650
現在我們只和她父母的律師聯繫過 但法律是站在你們這邊的
Right now we're in touch with her adoptive parents' lawyer, but the law is on your side.

373
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,630
我們能和父母談談嗎? 我們可以和他們商量
Can we talk to the parents? We could discuss this but the with them.

374
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,630
他們不希望進一步的接觸
They don't want to initiate contact.

375
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,500
他們經歷的已經很多了
They've been through a lot right now.

376
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,750
他們是她的父母 當然不想放棄她
They're her parents. Of course they don't want to give her up.

377
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,810
那如果她想見他們 我們考慮滿足 但我們是她的家人
Well,if she wants to see them,then we can work that out, but we are her family.

378
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,260
絕對的
Absolutely.

379
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,210
不 等等 這是不是有些風險在堶?
no,wait. What are the risks here?

380
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,960
如果我們要回她 會不會傷害她?
E we hurting her?

381
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,020
這不好說 有些孩子適應得很好
It's impossible to tell. Some kids do great.

382
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,230
有些孩子會有問題
Others have trouble.

383
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,690
但 我們為什麼要談風險? 她是Monica的女兒啊
But why are we talking about risks? She's monica's daughter.

384
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,840
Conrad... 她又不是他們的骨血
Conrad... She's not their blood.

385
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,420
別說了
Stop it.

386
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,660
謝謝你 Jareau警探
Thank you,agent jareau.

387
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,050
我丈夫和我需要商量一下這事
But my husband and i, we need to discuss this.

388
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,740
這是什麼? 這是我們在找的規律
What's this? It's the pattern i've been looking for.

389
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,820
不明疑犯隱藏處理媽媽們的蹤跡
The unsubs hid their tracks with the mothers,

390
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,870
但他們棄嬰卻不是那麼小心
but they weren't so careful with the abandoned babies.

391
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,440
你找到更多的孩子了嗎? 基因的角度沒 但綁架的角度有

392
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,230
我集中了所有那些
I gathered all the records for all infants

393
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,620
3位母親被害2周內進入 寄養系統的嬰兒記錄
who entered into foster care in a 2week window following each mother's death.

394
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,480
然後 我將範圍縮小至其中 被拋棄在教堂的嬰兒
Then i narrowed it down to babies that were abandoned at churches.

395
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,100
到這就要開始猜了
This is where the guesswork begins.

396
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,480
Monica Winmar的女兒是被 丟在一個長老派教會的教堂的
Monica's winmar's daughter was abandoned at a presbyterian church.

397
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,350
我們假設不明嫌犯 或至少他的妻子 是個長老派教會信徒
Let's assume the unsub, or the wife at least, is presbyterian.

398
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,670
這就意味著所有他們不想要的孩子 都會被丟在同樣教派教堂 對吧?
That means all other unwanted children are gonna be left at the same denomination,right?

399
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,960
這樣一來範圍縮小到 被三個長老教會收留的三個孩子
That narrows it down to 3 babies left at 3 different presbyterian churches

400
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,710
都在方圓二十里內
all within this 20mile radius.

401
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,240
就是他們住的地方
This is where they live.

402
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,650
你推斷的這些孩子 你看過資料嗎?
These kids you deduced tohave you looked at their files?

403
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,730
不 我現在還在追蹤教堂 怎麼了?
No. Right now i've only been tracking churches. Why?

404
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,500
因為你剛剛發現了另一種模式
Because you just uncovered another pattern.

405
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,900
嗯 我們準備出發了 2小時內到鳳凰城
Yeah, we're packing up now. We can be in phoenix in about 2 hours.

406
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,040
你確定嗎?
You sure about this?

407
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,860
Reid發現的小孩的名字說明了一切
The names of the babies reid found tells us everything.

408
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,130
Lisa Elizabeth Amanda
Lisa,elizabeth,amanda.

409
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,310
我們側寫有一類他們自己養 有一類他們給人收養
We profiled there'd be a type they'd keep and a type they'd put into foster care.

410
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,100
他們要留男孩子
They're keeping the boys.

411
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,190
是時候了
It's time.

412
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,120
你幹什麼?
What are you doing?

413
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,730
你幹什麼? 嘿 你去哪? 回來
What are you doing? Hey,where are you going? Come back!

414
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,830
你回來 求你了
You have to come back! Please!

415
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,030
這種時候 他們從不待在這兒
They never stay for this part.

416
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,240
不不不 你不是真的要...
No,no,no,no. You're not actually

417
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,040
是的
yes...I am.

418
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,160
他們給我催產了
They've induced.

419
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,690
我要怎麼辦?
What am i supposed to do?

420
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,790
來幫我
You help me.

421
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,830
一千...
11,000...

422
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,380
兩千... 不不不 對不起 我不行
21,000... No,no,no,i'm sorry, i can't.

423
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,320
我幫不了你 我... 三千...
I can't help you.I can't. 31,000...

424
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,040
我病了 我很不好
I'm sick. I'm not well.

425
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,560
我需要... 我做不到 Julie 聽我說
I need a... I can't do it. Julie,listen to me.

426
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,860
你在聽嗎? 是 我在聽
Are you listening to me? Yes. Yes.

427
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,400
如果這孩子生不下來的話
If this baby doesn't make it...

428
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,480
他們就會殺了我
They are going to kill me.

429
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,900
他們殺了我 下一個就輪到你 你懂了嗎?
And once they've killed me, they are going to move on to you. Do you understand?

430
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,670
好吧 好吧 我們要怎麼做
Ok. Ok. What do we do?

431
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,430
JJ 幫我找這些生育專家來問話
Jj,i need you to call these fertility specialists and get them over here for interviews.

432
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,800
是 我知道 Hotch想著重查 不明嫌犯給受害人吃的產前藥
Yeah,i know. Hotch wants to focus on the prenatal drugs the unsubs are giving the victims.

433
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,920
覺得能據此建立起新的嫌犯群 他昨天就想弄完了
He thinks we can build a new suspect pool, and he wants it done yesterday.

434
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,480
這埵釣潃雄的名字 該先縮小下範圍嗎?
There's 2 pages of names here. Shouldn't we narrow it down?

435
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,430
JJ 就照做行嗎?
Jj,just do it,ok?

436
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,640
抱歉
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,970
你還好嗎?
Is everything ok?

438
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,790
來這兒後 Hotch對我特別嚴 我不知道為什麼
Hos be on ever since we got here, and for the life of me, i can't figure out why.

439
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,720
好吧 我也許知道
Oh,i might know.

440
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,730
這案子之前 Strauss主管到BAU來了
The ghbeck this case, chief strauss stopped by the b.A.U.

441
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,470
他們關著房門 氣氛好像有點緊張
They were behind closed doors, and it seemed like it got a little tense.

442
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,290
好吧 上面的頭兒盯著他 他肯定知道要發生什麼
Well,the bureau's been on him for a while.

443
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,260
是啊 現在他們盯著他的每個決定

444
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,100
對Hotch來說 那真是...煎熬
For hotch,that's... Hell.

445
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,730
Dekeyser醫生 我們認為 她不是因病才服下產前藥
Dr. Dekeyser, we don't think she's getting these prenatal drugs as a patient.

446
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,020
你認為她自己給自己開的處方
You're thinking she's writing the scrip for these herself.

447
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,270
差不多
Something like that.

448
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,940
她可能不太知道她在做什麼
Then she wouldn't be very knowledgeable about what she's doing.

449
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,040
某些藥有嚴重的副作用
Some of these drugs have serious side effects.

450
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,830
比起這些 我可以開很多療效更好的藥
There's dozens of meds i would prescribe before these, all of them more effective.

451
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,190
所以她為什麼用這個?
So why would she use these?

452
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,690
我猜 是她能拿得到的吧
My guessthese are the ones she had access to.

453
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,400
催孕藥是混合物 你懷孕之前得一直混合它們
Fertility drugs are a cocktail, and you keep remixing the cocktail until you get pregnant.

454
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,590
網上到處都是這類信息 被她給找到了
The information is out there on the internet. She found the right one.

455
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,910
所以她也許是因為別的病開這些藥的
So the woman was prescribed these drugs maybe for some other illness

456
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,770
結果發現它們能催孕?
and figured out that they helped carry a baby to term.

457
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,980
正是這樣

458
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,070
最後個問題 這些藥還治什麼病?
Tlat o er ddo these drugs treat?

459
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,970
好 我可以 我可以的
Ok. I can do this. I can do this.

460
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,110
怎麼了?

461
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,570
沒什麼 你讓我想起我自己
You remind me of me.

462
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:19,030
我可以的 Carol? 求你了 要醒著
I can do this. Carol? Please?

463
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,390
好吧 就 就注意聽我的聲音 好嗎?
Ok,justjust focus on the sound of my voice,ok?

464
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,640
你行嗎? 我在這兒
Can you do that? I'm here.

465
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,760
Carol 跟我講講之前那個女人
Caell meouwoma who was here before me.

466
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,720
她怎麼了?
What happened to her?

467
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,920
她總是... 流產
She miscarried... A lot.

468
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,270
最後生了個女孩兒 他們不喜歡女孩兒
They don't le girls.

469
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,290
這也不是你第一次 對吧? 嗯
This isn yourfirst time,is it? No.

470
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,610
發生了什麼?
What happened?

471
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,280
他沒活下來
He didn't make it.

472
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,010
我很抱歉

473
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,820
即使孩子沒了 他們也會讓你活著
They let you live even if you lose him.

474
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,840
他們要男孩兒
They want those boys.

475
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,630
好吧 好吧
Ok. Ok,hey.

476
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,830
聽著 我不知道該怎麼做 求你 求你告訴我怎麼辦
Listen,i don't know what to do,ok, so please,please, just tell me what to do.

477
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,200
我張得有多大了? 什麼意思?
How dilated am i? 'Tnow what that means.

478
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,150
把你的手指並起來
Just put your fingers in a row and...

479
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,450
量一下 等等
Measure me. Wait...

480
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,750
哦 天哪
Oh,my god.

481
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:39,400
好吧 哦 我的天
Ok... Oh,my god.

482
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,120
四個 四根手指 我...
It's 4. it's 4 fingers.And i

483
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,110
哦 天哪 那是頭嗎?
oh,god, is that the head?

484
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,750
哦 上帝 這是怎麼回事?
Oh,my god, what does that mean?

485
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,890
這是... 要生了
It means... It's time to push.

486
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,440
這是什麼?
What is this?

487
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,290
這是戰術逮捕計劃 我要你給這案子寫一個
It's a tactical arrest plan. I'd like you to write it up for this case.

488
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,000
你要我寫 在保護孩子的前提下 如何抓捕不明嫌犯?
You want me to write up how we apprehend these unsubs without risking the lives of the children.

489
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,400
是
Yes.

490
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,590
Hotch 我帶過無數次抓捕行動
Hotch,i've led dozens of tactical assaults.

491
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,300
你之前從沒讓我寫過
You've never made me write up one of these before.

492
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,190
那是因為每次我都幫你寫了
That's because i always do it for you after each case.

493
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,050
你知道嗎?
You know what?

494
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,570
Strauss給你施壓 我也為你不平
I'm sorry strauss is coming down on you.

495
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,190
這和Strauss無關 真的? 我看不是
This is not about strauss. Really? I disagree.

496
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,250
我知道你現在擔子特別重
Look,i understand that you're under the gun.

497
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,280
但我不得不說 我並不是很吃驚
But i gotta say it. I'm really not all that surprised.

498
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,670
在華盛頓 一群警察擊倒了不明嫌犯 你卻走開了
I've watched you walk away from a bunch of cops gunning down unsubs in d.C.

499
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,860
在路易斯維爾 你手無寸鐵 就走進人質挾持現場
You walked in unprotected to a hostage situation in louisville.

500
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,110
局媟穔M會擔心你
Of course the bureau's worried about you.

501
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,330
夥計 我都很擔心你
Man,i'm worried about you.

502
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,480
但是 雖然你身在放大鏡下
But just because you're the one who's under the magnifying glass,

503
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,390
卻不意味著 我不能做好自己的工作
that doesn't mean i can't do my job.

504
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,090
Morgan 你有很大一部分工作 是我幫你完成的
Morgan,there's a big part of your job that i do for you

I don't have to justify my orders to you, and you do have to follow them.

509
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,560
如果你的命令言之有理 我向來聽從
I've always followed your orders when they made sense.

If this woman has breast cancer,would she be able to get pregnant?

518
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,250
可以 但必須做出犧牲 怎麼犧牲?

519
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,280
她得進行化療 那相當痛苦
Well,she'd have to go off chemotherapy. She'd be in a lot of pain.

520
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,350

They say it helps them cope with feelings of loss.

Shower,toilet,tile, and mesh fencing Which he did not put up in his backyard.

548
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,610
他在建他的地牢
He was building his dungeon.

549
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,810
沒有允許他們擴建的許可
No permits were filed for additional building on the property,

550
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,970
所以入口肯定在房子

551
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,260
要守幾個出入口?

在父母不知道的情況下 看看能不能救回那些孩子
See if we can get the kids out Before the parents even know what's happening.

他們可能會用他們做人質
I mean,the parents could take a hostage.

564
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,720
但如果我們硬闖進去 這個情況就肯定會發生

633
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,470
現在重要的是 如果Strauss找人取代我
But what matters now is if strauss replaces me,

634
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,310
整個行為分析部會受到審查
This whole unit will come under scrutiny.

635
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,100
隊員會被重新分配崗位 經費也會被削減
Members will be reassigned, budgets will be cut.

636
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,110
Hotch 沒人能取代你
Come on,hotch, nobody's gonna replace you.

637
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,500
和Strauss爭一爭啊 我會站在你這邊
Fight strauss. i'll go to the mat for you.

638
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,030
其他人也是一樣的  Morgan 這行不通的
So will everybody else. you know that. Morgan,it won't work.

639
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,690
做出這樣的決定 有他們的理由
Decisions like this have their own momentum...

640
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,460
除非我退出
Unless i step down.

641
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,780
退出 你在說什麼?
Step down? what are you talking about?

642
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,460
我這個週末會辭去部門主管的職位
I'm resigning as unit chief at the end of the week.

643
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,520
什麼? 不行!
What? No!

644
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,330
Hotch 沒錯 好吧
Hotch,look,yeah,ok,

645
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,210
有時候我是不同意你的行動
Sometimes your actions, i may disagree with them,

646
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,030
但不能因為這樣 你就要離開這個團隊
But it's not enough for you to leave this team.

647
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,160
我不是離開這個團隊 只是不再是領導者
I'm not leaving the team, I'm just no longer in charge.

648
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,360
你是
You are.

649
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,360
我?
Me?

650
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,050
我有機會在紐約成為部門主管 但我拒絕了
look,i had the chance to be unit chief in new york, And i said no.

651
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,920
因為我喜歡這個團隊
I turned it down because i like this team.

652
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,710
Strauss不能就這樣炒了你
Strauss can't just fire you like this.

653
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,460
她可以把我調職
She can reassign me.

654
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,600
如果我從內部提拔 就可以不必被調任
And we can avoid that if i promote internally.

655
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,570
這是不對的
This is wrong.

656
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,070
這是唯一保證我們團隊不解散的方法
It's the only way to keep the team together.

657
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,260
所以這些...
so all of this

658
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,460
所以你才對我這麼苛刻?
This is why you've been pushing me so hard,huh?

659
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,880
也沒那麼苛刻吧
I haven't been pushing you that hard.

660
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:52,150
Morgan 我需要你現在就告訴我 你願意嗎?
Morgan,i need to know Right nowWill you do this?

661
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,210
這只是暫時的
This would be temporary.

662
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,670
只要我們抓住Foyet 就可以一切恢復正常
Once we catch foyet, All this goes back to normal.

663
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,850
那開始行動吧
Let's get started.

664
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,550
這些是什麼?
What's all this?

665
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,580
都是工作 除非你有其他計劃
This is the job, Unless you have other plans.

666
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,220
今晚沒有
Not tonight.

667
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,200
