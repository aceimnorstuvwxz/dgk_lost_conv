NORTH MAMMON,PENNSYLVANIA

2
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,340
13 and 0,13 and 0!

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,900
13 and 0,13 and 0!

4
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,710
Next friday,our children will
be asked a question.

5
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,030
How they answer that will define us all.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,010
The question is: When victory and defeat,

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,570
life and death,hang in the balance,

8
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,160
what are you capable of?

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,890
State championship!

10
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,580
Number one!
Number one!

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,530
Same speech he gives every year.

12
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,280
That's because it works every year.

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,960
What are you doing?
You hate football.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,830
My brother's on the team.

15
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,820
You hate your brother.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,200
besides,did I ask you not to
go to the pep rally?

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,440
Did I ask you to dump the quarterback?

18
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,710
- Very nice.
- Come on,guys.

19
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,560
We're all tired,we're all hungry--

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,660
and we all know the second you
get some of this pizza,

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,610
you'll remember how much you love each other.

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,900
You ok?

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,280
Yeah.It's just a little cough,
it's not going to kill me.

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,560
Thanks for hanging with me.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,030
Always.

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,990
Besides,thank your daddy for leaving
us the house all weekend.

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,480
I need some air.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,600
Give me this.

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,850
- Polly.
- Ye.

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,390
Go on,I'll be right in.

31
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,510
Ok,I'm going to go shower.

32
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,520
Ok.

33
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,110
Hey,garbage girl,
better not forget to wash your hands.

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,360
Do I what say polly,or brooke and kelly die.

35
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,970
Now,get dressed.

36
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,220
Are you ok?

37
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,740
What does this guy want?

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
I don't know.

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,610
Did you tell him our names?

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,060
- What?
- He called us by name.

41
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,750
Did you tell him?

42
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,340
No.

43
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,400
She's right.
He knew our names.

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,750
What does that mean?

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,970
That he knows us,that he's someone we know?

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,810
Well,if he knows us,
why hasn't he talked to us?

47
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,370
'Cause he's some kind of freak!

48
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,960
If he comes back,we have to fight him together.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,900
Right.

50
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,720
This time,we fight,no matter what.
Ok?

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,040
He can't take all 3 of us at the same time.

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,140
We all attack him at once.

53
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,740
Are you sure you're ok?

54
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,320
God!
What does this guy want?

55
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,250
To choose.

56
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,270
To choose what?

57
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,950
2 of you will leave this room alive...

58
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,830
one of you will die.

59
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,110
You choose.

60
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,770

61
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,340
Mrs.Homefeldt?

62
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,940
Hi.I'm agent jareau.

63
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,570
Thank you for seeing me.

64
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,780
- Miles said it was an emergency.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,450
She said to give this to you.

66
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,830
You played soccer.

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,170
I don't understand.

68
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,860
By daughter,polly,played soccer,
too,for north mammon--

69
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,680
the varsity team--
she got a scholarship to penn state.

70
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,690
Forgive me,ma'am.

71
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,250
My aunt didn't really explain
to me the nature of this emergency.

72
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,260
No one is looking for them.

73
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,410
Here.

74
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,120
My daughter and her 2 friends,

75
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,380
they've been missing for 5 days,

76
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,960
and I know someone took them,
but no one will believe me.

77
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,700
- Missing?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,820
This--
this herE...

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,360
this is you,right?
I mean,you found this girl,right?

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,900
No,no,not just me.
The team here did.

81
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,320
It's been 5 days now.
Can you ask them to help me?

82
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,660
Because no one is looking for my polly.

83
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,730
Well,as much as we might want
to take this case,

84
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,070
we have to be invited by local authorities.

85
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,110
I'm sure that this friend of
your aunt's is very concerned,

86
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,220
but it just doesn't work that way.

87
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,900
I called the police chief.He faxed over
an official request for our assistance.

88
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,310
This is brooke chambers.

89
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,750
Her father,peter,a widower,
left her home alone for the weekend.

90
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,990
Polly homefeldt and kelly seymour were
sleeping over saturday night.

91
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,080
At 9:35 P.M. During the town's pep rally
for the high school football team,

92
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,390
both kelly and polly called home.

93
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,830
It's me.

94
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,510
I know this is last minute,
but please don't be angry.

95
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,710
Brooke,kelly and i are going to
take off on a road trip for a few days,

96
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,340
sort of our last adventure before graduation.

97
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,820
We'll be back friday night.
Love you,bye.

98
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,910
Kelly seymour left this message on
her parents' machine 44 seconds later.

99
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,790
It's me.

100
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,600
I know this is last minute,
but please don't be angry.

101
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,940
Brooke,polly,and i are going to
take off on a road trip for a few days,

102
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,880
sort of our last adventure before graduation.

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,930
We'll be back friday night.
Love you,bye.

104
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,090
- Exactly the same.
- Word for word.

105
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,340
Both calls made were made from brooke's cell,
which has since been turned off.

106
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,790
And there's been no activity on
their cell phones or atm cards since saturday.

107
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,750
It does sound like they were
reading from a script.

108
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,550
And obviously,since the phone's turned off,
I can't use it to locate the girl,

109
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,250
but I have an open trap on the number
in case it gets turned back on.

110
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,490
Ok,guys,guys,not for nothing.

111
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,820
I remembery senior year in high school.

112
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,930
Isn't it possible these girls
just took off on a road trip?

113
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,150
No.

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,430
Absolutely not.

115
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,830
Polly accepted an athletic
scholarship to penn state.

116
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,440
I was a high school athlete,
just like these girls.

117
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,690
I was these girls.

118
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,880
They don't smoke,they don't do drugs,
they don't drink during the season,

119
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,600
and they did not jeopardize a fulbright
scholarship by cutting school and missing practice.

120
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,760
Ok.
I hear you,jj.

121
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,100
It has been 5 days.

122
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,060
There's a chance these girls...

123
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,620
there's a chance we may not find them.

124
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,890
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

125
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,550
The phone messages.

126
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,990
If they were reading from a script,they said,
I'll see you next friday,not 2 days,not 2 weeks,friday.

127
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,200
Why be that specific?

128
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,160
My guess is we have until friday to find them.

129
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,730
2 days.

130
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,240
So,are we taking this case?

131
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,830
Wheels up in 30 minutes.

132
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,620
Legendary basketball coach john wooden once said,

133
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,600
"it's not so important who starts the game,
but who finishes it.¡±

134
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,870
Hi,I'm sergeant sykes,tom,if you want.

135
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,650
Derek morgan.

136
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,600
Agent gideon,Dr. Reid.
Jason gideon.How are you?

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,460
Hope we haven't brought you folks
out here for nothing.

138
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,780
You don't believe the girls are missing?

139
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,210
It's not really the kind of thing that happens
around here,you know?

140
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,490
You'd be surprised to know how
many times we hear that.

141
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,880
Still,I've been through the house myself
and nothing looks out of place at all.

142
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,380
You talk to chambers,the father?

143
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,260
- Haven't located him yet.
- Is that unusual?

144
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,930
Chambers is a lawyer.
He's always out of town on business.

145
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,330
November 3rd.
That's tomorrow.

146
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,380
State championship football game.
North mammon is finally back in it.

147
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,540
Show us inside.

148
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,740
Chief yates,jennifer jareau,
we spoke on the phone.

149
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,210
- Hi.
- This is agent hotchner.

150
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,290
Hi,jeff yates.
Hi,judy.

151
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,250
Hey,why don't you go on inside and make
yourself comfortable.

152
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,090
- We'll be in in a minute.
- Okay.

153
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,300
Chief yates,there's not much of
a case file yet.

154
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,050
Listen,I can't get anyone to agree
the girls are actually missing.

155
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,030
Mrs.Homefeldt certainly believes it.

156
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,090
Yeah,well,I wouldn't put too much
stock in what judy homefeldt thinks.

157
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,500
Why is that?

158
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,750
She's got a history of mental problems.

159
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
- What kind of history?
- Depression.

160
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,110
Just heard she's even on medication.

161
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,510
Didn't she raise polly on her own after
her husband abandoned her,what,12 years ago?

162
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,990
That's right.
Yeah.

163
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,790
If you were in her place,
don't you think you'd be a little depressed?

164
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,240
Point taken.

165
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,520
Chief,if you're not sure the girls are missing,
why would you request our help?

166
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,000
Listen,something happened.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,920
I'm just not sure what and if it's bad,
I'll take all the help I can get.

168
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,120
Plus,your agent jareau can be pretty convincing.

169
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,850
Are the parents inside?

170
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,000
Well,kelly's parents are in there.We still
haven't been able to track down brooke's father,petE.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,870
He's--
well,he travels a lot.

172
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,270
Listen,these people are my friends,ok?

173
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,470
They're my neighbors,good people.

174
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,740
I don't want anybody assuming
that they're involved.

175
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,400
We just got here,we're not assuming anything.

176
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
Go ahead.

177
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,460
You were right,sergeant.

178
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,590
No forced entry,no sign of struggle.

179
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,270
If someone did attack these girls,
they chose to comply pretty fast.

180
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,470
If there were only 2 ways to immediately
get compliance without the use of force,

181
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,940
that's either the threat of force
or previously established trust.

182
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,560
Whoever it was,it took a lot of planning.

183
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,400
Detailed information about the girls.

184
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,910
When brooke's father was gone,
when the other parents were out.

185
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,750
How do you mean?

186
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,700
He knew they'd have to leave messages.

187
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,260
With that script,they couldn't
talked to the parents directly.

188
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,700
Close family friend or a stalker.

189
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,280
The folks here look after each other.

190
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,050
There's no way an outsider stalker
stalked these girls without being noticed.

191
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,260
We have to assume the people who abducted
these girls were members of the community.

192
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,110
Would have needed a spot to watch her from.

193
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,290
Should we expect a ransom demand?

194
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,110
Kidnappers who want money contact the families
to prove they have possession of the victim.

195
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,020
They don't call to conceal it.

196
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,800
Kidnappers.
Are we sure they just haven't run off?

197
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,590
It's pretty unusual the girls
left identical messages.

198
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,830
They feel scripted.

199
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,230
- Why would kelly run off?
- Here's the thing.

200
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,600
This is a football town,
kelly plays girl's soccer.

201
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,900
Our son is on the football team.

202
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,920
This week,
the football is all anyone cares about.

203
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,780
That didn't always sit right with kelly.

204
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,160
Should it,gill?

205
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,650
Should her being told that she's not
as important sit right with her?

206
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,690
I didn't say she wasn't as important.

207
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,660
You never said it.

208
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,050
No,it's going to be all right.

209
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,220
She'll be back after the game,you'll see.

210
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,940
Come on,i got some tissue in the office.

211
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,990
You can see all the windows from here.

212
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,390
Someone's spent a lot of time here.

213
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,250
Aw,damn.

214
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,870
Has it rained since saturday night?

215
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,380
No.

216
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,670
He who seeks the queen of all knowledge,
speak and be recognize.

217
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,630
Garcia,we're sending you some cigarettes.

218
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,500
Yeah,why not a flesh-eating virus?
It'll be faster and far less painful.

219
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,320
We need some butts rushed to
the lab for dna analysis.

220
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,960
Oh,reid,I love it when you say butts.

221
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,610
Send away,sugar.
Bang bang for now.

222
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,290
Do you really think someone from
our town's involved in this?

223
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,250
You said it yourself,
an outsider would have been noticed.

224
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,310
Sergeant sykes.

225
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,340
What?

226
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,470
Looks like chief yates won himself
a title back in the day.

227
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,590
- They do like their football.
- Trust me,it's like a religion.

228
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,890
Do you think it strange that with 3 girls missing,

229
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,320
nobody's talking about canceling
tomorrow night's game?

230
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,100
Come on,hutch,it's football.
They know they can play without girls.

231
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,970
Just found brooke's car,abandoned.

232
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm freezing.

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,030
We're all cold,we're all hungry.

234
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,840
She has a fever.

235
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,050
Complaining about it isn't going
to make it any better.

236
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,900
Do you have to be so mean?

237
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Mean?
Some jerk puts us in a box,and I'm mean?

238
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,350
You don't see brooke and me jumping
on you about it.

239
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,500
I don't see you or brooke a doing a damn thing!

240
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,810
Guys,this is what he wants.

241
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,870
How long have we been down here?

242
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,640
We don't even know where here iS.

243
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,700
He doesn't want us to know.

244
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,350
He wants to break us down.

245
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,330
It's called sensory depravation.

246
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,440
Well,it's not going to work!

247
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,030
You hear me,you son of a bitch?!
It's not going to work!

248
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,810
Yes,it will.

249
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,550
If he doesn't give us water and food...

250
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,720
it will work.

251
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,320
We could die down here.

252
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,960
It's covered in dust.
It must've been here for quite a while.

253
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,310
So much for the spontaneous road trip.

254
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,790
This isn't a very traveled area.

255
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,700
Not really.

256
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,570
So,the car's left in town where
it would eventually be found.

257
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,590
Eventually.

258
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,590
Gideon,it's from the football team.

259
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,150
It says K.E.
On the brim.

260
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,710
- Could be kip engler.
- Who?

261
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,240
Ah,he's the quarterback.
He and brooke were an item.

262
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,340
What,you think he had something to do with this?

263
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,400
Was he at the pep rally saturday night?

264
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,610
- Yeah,he was the star of it.
- Then no.

265
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,920
But I think we know the kind of
person we're looking for.

266
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,960
Brooke kelly and polly have been
missing for 5 days.

267
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,860
Usually in cases like this we wouldn't
expect to find them alive.

268
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,140
However,in this case,we don't believe that to be true.

269
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,340
The person responsible spent considerable
time and energy planning the abduction.

270
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,570
He did not do all this work to simply
kill the girls once he had them.

271
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,530
Otherwise,he would've done it
at the chamber's house.

272
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,310
He certainly seemed to know he had the time.

273
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,690
And he had kelly and polly reference friday
in the messages they left for their parents.

274
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,530
We think the unsub has something planned
for the night of your championship game.

275
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,910
We are certain the unsub is someone
from this community.

276
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,960
How do you know that?

277
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,810
Because,Mr. Chambers,he didn't have your
daughter leave you a phone message or a note,did he?

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,410
Not that I know of.

279
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,150
'Cause he knew you'd be out of town for a while.

280
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,420
Just like he knew the dump site for
the car would eventually be found.

281
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,560
Everything points to him giving himself time.

282
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,710
Time for what?

283
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,790
- I don't know yet,sir.
- Well,what's been done about it?

284
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,430
Sir,I'm with the fbi.
We're going to need some information.

285
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,060
Wait a minute.

286
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,930
If someone from this town's taken my brooke,
I want to know what the hell's being done about it.

287
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,120
Yes,I know,sir.If you'd just come with me.
I will explain everything.All right?

288
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,300
Thank you.

289
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,490
Predatory abductors like this unsub
are intelligent,patient,and cautious.

290
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,790
They like to watch everything--
the victims,the families,the police.

291
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,930
He's surely watching us now and may even
attempt to inject himself into our investigation.

292
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,130
We also know that predatory abductors
prepare a nest prior to the abduction.

293
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,710
A remote cabin,an underground bunker,

294
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,330
a safe and secure place that only
he has access to.

295
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,460
Designed to confine and conceal his
prey once his hunting is done.

296
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,090
Should we be looking for this nest?

297
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,440
You'd never find it.

298
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,290
For his nest,predatory abductor
john jemelske built

299
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,760
a sophisticated dungeon complex
under a suburban syracuse home,

300
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,180
where he documented every detail of torture he
carried out upon the victims he kept there for 3 years.

301
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,740
The man who kidnapped these girls
has a relationship or

302
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,540
a job that permitted them to get
close enough to watch them.

303
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,710
We must focus on those people who had access.

304
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,420
A family member,a teacher,
a next door neighbor,it sounds clich?

305
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,110
but often it is the person you least suspect.

306
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,900
One more thing to remember.

307
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,250
We're looking for someone who was
not at the pep rally.

308
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,000
Ask the community,I'm sure somebody videotaped it.

309
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,450
You can go through the tapes,
start eliminating townspeople.

310
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,260
I'm sorry,sir.
Mr. Chambers just took off.

311
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,810
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

312
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,990
That was garcia.She just ran the cigarette
butts through codus and got a name--

313
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,000
donald haas?

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,220
Don haas is the girls' soccer coach.

315
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,180
Was coach haas at the pep rally?

316
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,660
I don't remember seeing him there,no.

317
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,820
Where would coach haas be right now?

318
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,010
Now,I know that we're all upset about
polly and brooke and kelly,

319
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,550
but it is important that we
keep a positive attitude.

320
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,890
Those girls,they'd want you to be strong.

321
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,600
They'd want your prayers.

322
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,700
Where's my daughter,you son of a bitch?

323
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,390
I get the charge dropped,
and this is what you do for me?

324
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,570
- Take it easy,take it easy!
- He did it before in pittsburgh!

325
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,250
He was arrested,and I got him off.
I got you off,you son of a bitch.

326
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,950
That's enough!

327
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,610
Little help!

328
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,830
Are you okay?

329
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,950
They're all turning on each other.

330
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm hungry.

331
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,870
Remember when we played ashland?

332
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,120
You stopped like a hundred shots on goal?

333
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,470
It wasn't a hundred.

334
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,760
You were on fire that day.

335
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,880
You're the great player,polly.

336
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,360
You're the one going to penn state.

337
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,570
You're going to come visit me,right?

338
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,390
There's got to be a way to get
him to come down here.

339
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,550
He's not coming down.

340
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,460
You know,some of us are trying to
come up with solutions,brooke.

341
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,960
Don'T.
She's sick.

342
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,330
She's sick,she's sick.

343
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,170
What about me?
I'm sick!

344
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,450
I'm sick of trying to come up with a plan
while little miss perfect over here just whines.

345
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,520
She has a plan.

346
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,020
What are you talking about?

347
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,110
She already has a plan.

348
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,470
Why hasn't she told us?

349
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,060
Because I'm not sick enough yet.

350
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,880
Hey.

351
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,340
What the hell is wrong with pete,huh?

352
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,270
Going crazy like that.

353
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,390
Like I had something to do with this.

354
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,550
- Mind if I smoke?
- Yes.

355
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,570
You smoke more than 100's,Mr. Haas?

356
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,160
Yeah.

357
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,340
We found 13 morley 100 cigarette butts

358
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,000
with your dna on them across the street
from the chamber's house.

359
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,260
This is a mistake.

360
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,750
Somebody has made a mistake.

361
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,040
You smoke those cigarettes and left
something for yourself on them,sir.

362
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,520
That's a fact.

363
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,350
Yeah,but I did not leave them there.

364
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,990
- Can you tell me who did?
- How the hell should I know?

365
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,330
All right,thanks.
You can go back to work now.

366
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,500
THE SAGINAW MOTEL.

367
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,240
Here's the guest registry.

368
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,510
All right.

369
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,360
I'll get started running these
names through the computer.

370
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,550
There's a name in there,john sherman,
you're not going to find it in the state computer.

371
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:17,040
He stays here once a month,and he pays me
$100 cash over the rate so i'll look the other way.

372
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,130
And you don't ask for I.D.?

373
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,030
Well,I don't have to...
see,because I know the guy.

374
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,220
Only his name's not sherman.

375
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,390
It's chambers.
Peter chambers.

376
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,860
Don haas kidnapped my daughter.

377
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,960
Now,why are you wasting time talking to me?

378
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,770
He's being questioned in another room.

379
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,760
Tell me why you're so convinced that it was him.

380
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,500
He said it was someone from this community.

381
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,810
The only person I know capable of doing something like this is don.

382
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,260
What do you mean,capable?

383
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,830
He's a sex offender.

384
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,810
His record is clean.

385
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,430
Yeah,well,6 years ago,don called me from pittsburgh

386
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,780
and he'd been arrested for soliciting an underage prostitute.

387
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,300
Why did he call you?

388
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,590
Because I'm a lawyer.

389
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,570
We'd been friends for 30 years.

390
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,190
We played football together in high school.

391
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,530
So,why did you agree to help him?

392
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,760
'Cause don swore it was a one-time thing.

393
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,530
The guy was going through a divorce,the girl had a record.

394
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,240
I made sure that a sex offender could still spend all his working hours around young girls.

395
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,060
God,I practically gave him my daughter.

396
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,720
Chambers represented haas in a minor sex offense case 6 years ago,

397
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,140
had the record expunged.

398
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,440
What kind of sex offense?

399
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,580
An underage prostitute.

400
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,970
Sounds like the right kind of crime?

401
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,700
Could be.

402
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,860
Well,haas swears he didn't put the cigarette butts there.

403
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,590
Does it strike anyone else as grossly inconsistent

404
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,270
that an unsub this sophisticated and

405
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,930
methodical would leave an obvious pile of his dna at the crime scene?

406
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,660
Don haas was at the pep rally.

407
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,710
I saw him in 2 different video tapes.

408
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,710
I guess I must've missed him.

409
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,630
All 3 of the victims' soccer jersies were found behind

410
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,800
the motel peter chambers has been staying at for the last week.

411
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,840
Don haas has an alibi for the night your daughter was taken.

412
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,670
-What?
-Video.

413
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,310
At the exact time the other girls were leaving their scripted messages,

414
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,660
he was at the pep rally.

415
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,120
Oh,my god.

416
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,150
You said you were in philadelphia on business last week.

417
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,870
I'm sorry?

418
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,280
Were you in philadelphia?

419
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,970
You think I hurt my daughter?

420
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,250
We just found the girls' soccer uniforms behind the saginaw motel.

421
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,720
What?

422
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,270
Were you in philadelphia on business last weekend?

423
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,690
No.

424
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,140
Where were you?

425
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,140
I was at the saginaw motel.

426
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,180
What were you doing there?

427
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,570
I meet a friend there once a month.

428
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,850
Actually,he's more than a friend.

429
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,210
This is a small town.

430
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,850
These are small town people.

431
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,610
They're wonderful in many ways,but there are some things they just don't understand.

432
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,080
I need a name.

433
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,060
Glenn donahue.

434
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,550
He lives on rittenhouse square...

435
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,670
with his wife...

436
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,140
and his 2 little boys.

437
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
These men are innocent.

438
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,900
You're sure?

439
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,850
Unsub planted evidence to implicate them.

440
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,420
Forensic countermeasures.

441
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,050
So,we've got no suspects,no reliable evidence,we've got nothing.

442
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,650
We have the behavior.

443
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,910
The fact of the countermeasures.

444
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,560
He tried to implicate haas and chambers.

445
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,880
That would mean haas and chambers had significance to him,right?

446
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,980
Who he's implicated may be as important as who he's abducted.

447
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,680
He's been watching them all for a long time.

448
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,040
See them.

449
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,020
We need to bring the parents and the people he implicated in.

450
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,820
They,along with the girls,are his targets,

451
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,140
and it may be the key to finding him before it's too late.

452
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,950
He's ahead of us.

453
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,600
Has been all along.

454
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,100
I got a bad feeling about this one.

455
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,620
Me,too.

456
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,180
I know it's terrible,but she's sick,

457
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,670
and pretty soon you will be,too.

458
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,210
I'm not listening.

459
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,100
She is dying already.

460
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,860
What?

461
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,950
You don't know that.

462
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,240
Look at her,polly.

463
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,990
She isn't going to make it.

464
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,550
We have to face facts.

465
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,380
She's dying.

466
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,630
No she's not.

467
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,060
Yes,she is.But we don't have to.

468
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,610
So,what we have to do is sacrifice our friend and we're safe.

469
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,220
We didn't do that to her,ok?

470
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,310
How do you know he'll let us go anyway?

471
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,560
Did you ever think of that?

472
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,650
What if he's just some evil,

473
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,280
twisted psycho who gets off watching people fight with each other.

474
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,640
Maybe we can get her help if we st get out of here.

475
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,770
He said one of us has to die.

476
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,160
If we don't choose,we are never going to see our families again,ever.

477
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,690
No one will ever know what happened to us,

478
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,920
we'll starve to death and no one will ever know.

479
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,070
You'll never see your mother again,ever.

480
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,370
My mom would be totally alone.

481
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,910
Totally alone.

482
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,100
There's no other choice,is there?

483
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,350
No,polly,I'm sorry,but there is no other choice.

484
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,820
She's going to die anyway,right?

485
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,230
That's right,but we don't have to.

486
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,710
All right.

487
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,380
Ok.

488
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,300
Hey,mister.

489
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,310
We made our choice.

490
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,170
God.

491
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,470
No.

492
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,750
What's happening?

493
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,390
Nothing,brooke.

494
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,080
Nothing.Go back to sleep.

495
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,760
This unsub,or unknown subject,is someone you know.

496
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,550
He's someone from your past,

497
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,550
and he's someone who thinks that you have wronged him.

498
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,580
We'd like for you to think about who might fit that description.

499
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,130
Don't you think if we knew who we did this or why we would've told you?

500
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,940
Please,let him talk,gill.

501
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,370
Oh,I'm going to take advice from somebody on mental medication?

502
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,750
What?

503
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,770
Everyone knows,judy.

504
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,160
Could we just stay focused,please?

505
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,870
The man who took your daughters.

506
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,240
He framed don haas and peter chambers for a reason.

507
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,070
This is an attack on you.

508
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,000
I have made mistakes in my life,but why take it out on brooke?

509
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,180
You know,it's one thing for brooke to pay for your mistakes,

510
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,150
but if my daughter has to pay for them,too--

511
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,310
Mr. Seymour,that's not helping.

512
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,410
That's not fair,gill.

513
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,870
Fair?

514
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,230
You shut the hell up,you're nothing but a pervert.

515
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,820
You will never get near the children of this town again.

516
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,470
We need to keep this as civil as possible.

517
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,210
Gill,are you even listening?It wasn't don.

518
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,450
He had nothing to do with it.

519
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,410
You knew he was a deviant,you didn't tell us.

520
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,970
We let him coach our girls.

521
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,890
His arrest was a sunderstanding,ok?

522
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,910
We talked to the hotel manager,peter.

523
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,080
We know about you.

524
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,210
Maybe this is god's punishment.

525
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,270
Oh,punishment.

526
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,340
Ok.

527
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,930
At least I didn't spend the week my daughter

528
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,820
was missing focusing on my son and the damn football game!

529
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,660
No,we know what you spent the week doing.

530
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,140
I blame myself for ever letting kelly be friends with brooke and polly to begin with.

531
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,620
Low breeding always shows through.

532
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,660
Low breeding?

533
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,910
They're bad seeds.

534
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,460
They always have been.

535
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,870
Don't talk about my daughter like that,all right?

536
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,880
That's enough!

537
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,870
What is the matter with you people?

538
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,360
This is exactly what he wants.

539
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,450
He is attacking all of you.

540
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,470
He is turning all of you against each other,and you're just letting him do it.

541
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,290
Your daughters are best friends,

542
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,220
and you all have known each other most of your lives as friends.

543
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,610
Don't let this man beat you this way.

544
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,020
What do you want us to do?

545
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,670
Listen to these agents,all right?

546
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,460
They came here to help.Let them do that.

547
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,830
We're going to split you up,

548
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,920
go over your histories,

549
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,940
and see if there's a name from your past in common.

550
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,890
Probably won't be a casual acquaintance.

551
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,260
He knows your secrets.

552
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,970
Don't just think people you've knowingly wronged.

553
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,420
It may be something you're not even aware of,or you may have forgotten--

554
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,450
agent gideon.

555
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,880
It's penelope garcia from quantico.She says it's urgent.

556
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,120
Put her on speaker.

557
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,330
Go ahead,garcia.

558
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,750
Brooke chamber's phone just switched back on.

559
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,110
Tell me you got a trace.

560
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,570
And a location.Downtown north mammon,

561
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,360
within 100 meters of the intersection of main and first.

562
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,170
That's right outside.

563
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,400
-Morgan.
-Yeah.

564
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,560
You keep the parents *********

565
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,590
what's going on?

566
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,690
Back up.Come on.*******

567
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,520
It's ok.

568
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,620
We're with the fbi.Are you all right?

569
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,020
Polly,are you hurt?

570
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,420
She's bleeding.

571
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,460
It's not her blood.

572
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,140
Brooke.

573
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,250
Where's kelly seymour?

574
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,130
Let me get you some more water.

575
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,700
I'll get it.

576
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,280
Polly,do you know who did this to you?

577
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,890
Whatever happened...

578
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,790
you're a very brave woman.

579
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,250
Not many people can face what you did and...

580
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,170
make it out the other side.

581
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,820
It wasn't polly's fault.

582
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,040
She didn't do anything.

583
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,180
Nothing's happened.I'm just getting her some water.

584
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,300
Is she talking?

585
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,230
Did she say where kelly is?

586
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,230
We're working on it.

587
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,620
Agent charill,when you said we all grew up together,something struck me.

588
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,240
What's that?

589
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,070
We all played football together.

590
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,750
Don,pete,even chief yates.

591
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,100
We were all on the last championship football team.

592
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,560
The championship game's tonight.

593
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,760
Polly,can you tell us were kelly seymour is?

594
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,760
Where's the water?

595
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,990
Hutch,do you mind if I--

596
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,050
no,please.

597
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,710
Hi,polly.

598
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,020
My name is jj.

599
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,540
I grew up in east allegheny,just right up the road.

600
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,570
I was captain of the varsity soccer team my senior year.

601
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,570
It got me a scholarship to pittsburgh.

602
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,700
It was a pretty good school,

603
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,450
but it's not exactly penn state.

604
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,650
I know that's where you're going because your mom told me.

605
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,500
You know,your mom carried a picture of you

606
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,390
all the way up to the fbi academy in quantico,virginia

607
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,070
so that me and these agents here could help find you.

608
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,890
And,believe me,she was not leaving until we said we'd come.

609
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,930
So,no matter what happened over the past 6 days...

610
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,310
no matter what...

611
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,070
this will all be a memory someday...

612
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,950
but you will always have a mother that loves you that much.

613
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,100
I want to show you a photograph,polly.

614
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,460
I want you to look at the men in the picture

615
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,920
and tell me if you see the man that did this to you.

616
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,310
Ok?

617
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,670
Ok.

618
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,370
It's ok.

619
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,890
We were so hungry...

620
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,860
so thirsty...

621
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,200
so cold.

622
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,570
He wants us to do it?

623
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,610
If that's what it takes to get out of this alive--

624
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,520
no way,I can'T.

625
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,970
You don't have a choice.

626
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,860
I can'T.I can'T.

627
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,970
Listen,it's like like those soccer players who crashed in the andes.

628
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,100
They were starving,they had no food,nothing to eat except for their friends o had died.

629
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,680
They were good people,but they didn't have a choice.

630
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,810
They did what they had to do.

631
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,020
You killed her.

632
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,470
I didn't have any choice.

633
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,850
They had already decided to...

634
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,940
but it wasn't polly's fault.

635
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,010
It was him.

636
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,010
He said we had to choose.

637
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,080
Who was he,brooke?Who made you choose?

638
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,150
I never saw him.

639
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,120
He made us...

640
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,400
choose.

641
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,520
Who did?

642
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,970
Good job.

643
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,930
Hutch,it's the guy that found the soccer jerseys.

644
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,230
It's the garbage man.

645
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,850
Marcus younger.

646
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,110
Polly just id'd him.

647
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,430
He was the star of our team.

648
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,460
Blew his knee out in the first quarter of the championship.

649
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,700
Lost his fulbright scholarship to notre dame.

650
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,570
Do you know where he lives?

651
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,790
Come on.

652
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,610
Clear!

653
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,830
Guys.

654
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,170
There's a storm cellar outside.

655
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,980
Don't move!

656
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,040
I got him.

657
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,440
Marcus younger?

658
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,570
Fbi.

659
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,390
I never touched her.

660
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,770
Put your hands where I can see them.

661
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,350
I never hurt them.

662
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,440
Get up,marcus.

663
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,830
I never even came into the room,jeff.

664
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,510
They did this.

665
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,780
Brooke and polly.

666
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,210
All I did was show them who they really are,

667
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,730
what they were truly capable of.

668
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,750
People pretending to be decent.

669
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,330
When it came down to it,they,uh...

670
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,600
they reacted just the way I knew they would.

671
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,180
They turned on each other.

672
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,530
Just like when I got hurt.

673
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:43,170
You all couldn't wait to run over me,to take my position,to take my life...

674
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,060
and to forget all about me.

675
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,510
Marcus,I'm not going to ask you again.

676
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,970
Get up.

677
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,400
You don't know what it's like,jeff.

678
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,470
You all have lives,and I just cleaned up after you.

679
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,810
Now,you have to clean up after me.

680
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,630
-You get him out of here.
-let's go.

681
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,720
***********************  ***self

682
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,600
this ********************************to love or the hat

683
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,540
***************************

684
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,560
Can't sleep?

685
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,230
You can't imagine the pressures a small town creates.

686
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:58,880
To play,to win,everyone pushing,everyone watching,I hated it.

687
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,180
Why did you play?

688
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,970
Athletic scholarship was the only way I was getting to college.

689
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,980
It was my only way out.

690
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,290
Besides,having a thick skin when it comes to pressure

691
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,530
is a good thing in this line of work,right?

692
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,930
You did exceptional work the last couple of days.

693
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,310
Thank you.

694
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,790
It's nice to be noticed.

695
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,610
Yeah.We don't usually,do we?

696
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,700
Eh,it's all right.

697
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,730
It's not why I do it.

698
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,530
Have you ever thought about taking the classes,becoming a profiler?

699
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,510
No.No.

700
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:35,760
I admire what you guys do,but I like my role.

701
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,360
I like being the person the family can turn to.

702
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,390
Being the voice the poor,

703
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:45,230
the over-worked homicide detective can call when he runs out of leads.

704
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,480
Really?

705
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,350
Yeah.

706
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,750
I thought everyone wanted to be a profiler.

707
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,730
Sorry.

708
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,320
What's all of that?

709
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,260
New cases.

710
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,630
I got to figure out where going to next.

711
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,730
Hey,wait a minute,we're the profilers.I thought we made those decisions.

712
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,190
Sure you do.

713
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,550
All right.Well,I'm going to find someplace to get some sleep.

714
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,320
-Yeah,good luck with that.
-Thanks.
