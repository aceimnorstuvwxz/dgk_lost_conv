威廉·施萬克·吉爾伯特(英國著名劇作家) 寫道 "愛讓世界轉動"
W.s.gilbert wrote, "it's love that makes the world go 'round."

2
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,660
如果這是真的 那Haley的世界 就旋轉得稍快了一些
And if that's true, then the world spun a little faster with haley in it.

3
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,700
從高中時代起 Haley就是我最好的朋友
Haley was my best friend since we were in high school.

4
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,450
我們確實有過不快 但如果還有一件事 能讓我們彼此無條件認同
We certainly had our struggles, but if there's one thing we agreed on unconditionally,

5
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,330
那就是對我們兒子Jack的愛和責任
It was our love and commitment to our son jack.

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,820
Haley對Jack的愛 是快樂而無畏的
Haley's love for jack was joyous and fierce.

7
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,440
可正是這種無畏 讓她不能站在我們中間
That fierceness is why she isn't here today.

8
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,590
母愛是自然界中至高無上的力量
A mother's love is an unrivaled force of nature.

9
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,740
Haley的行為讓我們獲益良多
And we can all learn much from the way haley lived her life.

10
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,270
Haley的死 讓我們每個人停下腳步 回首自己的人生
Haley's death causes each of us to stop and take stock of our lives.

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,260
審視我們是怎樣的人 審視我們走過的路
To measure who we are and what we've become.

12
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,180
關於自身 我還沒有全部答案 但我瞭解Haley的為人
I don't have all those answers for myself, but i know who haley was.

13
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,730
為了保護我們共同孕育的孩子 她勇於犧牲
She was the woman who died protecting the child we brought into this world together.

14
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,080
Jack長大後 我一定會讓他明白 她的母親是個怎樣的人
And i will make sure that jack grows up knowing who his mother was

15
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,460
她是如何愛他 保護他 讓他明白我有多麼愛她
And how she loved and protected him and how much i loved her.

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,520
如果Haley今天在這 她會希望我們 不要哀悼她的死亡 而是緬懷她的人生
If haley were with us today, she would ask us not to mourn her death but to celebrate her life.

17
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,600
她會告訴我們...
She would tell us...

18
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,210
她會告訴我們要無條件地熱愛家庭
She would tell us to love our families unconditionally...

19
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,210
和他們緊緊擁抱在一起 因為到頭來 這才是最重要的事
And to hold them close, because in the end, they are all that matter.

20
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,890
我們是在高中音樂劇<潘贊斯的海盜> 試演中相遇的(吉爾伯特的著名輕歌劇)
I met haley at the tryouts of our high school's production of "the pirates of penzance."

21
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,340
前幾天晚上 我找到了當時演出的拷貝 獨自看著
I found our copy of the play and was looking through it the other night,

22
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,570
發現有一段歌詞
And i came upon a passage that seemed...

23
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,420
似乎很合適在此刻朗讀
Appropriate for this moment.

24
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,230
"喔 擦乾晶瑩的眼淚 它如露珠般流過堅毅的臉龐"
"oh, dry the glistening tear "that dews that martial cheek.

25
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,840
"聽著 可愛的孩子 你從中探尋著安慰"
"thy loving children hear, "in them thy comfort seek.

26
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,480
"帶著同情與關懷 他們的胳膊環繞你 撫摸著"
"with sympathetic care "their arms around thee creep,

27
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,360
"為了 他們無法承受的父親的淚光"
"for, oh, they cannot bear to see their father weep."

28
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,320
放下吧
Ok, you can go ahead.

29
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,400
給媽媽一個飛吻
Blow mommy a kiss.

30
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,450
- 如果有什麼我可以幫忙的... - 謝謝

- I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you, gina. Thank you for coming.

32
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,130
我想你應該需要透透氣
I think you could use some air.

33
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,980
- Jack沒事了 我看見他和表兄弟們一起 - 嗯
- Jack's ok. I saw him with his cousins. - Ok.

34
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,290
Jessica 你能幫Jack拿些吃的嗎?
Jessica, would you make sure that jack gets something to eat?

35
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,580
- 當然 - 我馬上回來 謝謝
- Sure. - And i'll be right back. Thanks.

36
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,450
我們應該做些什麼?
What do we do?

37
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,330
我們幫不上什麼 只能等他自己平復心情
There's nothing we can do. We just gotta wait him out.

38
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,200
你們覺得他會回來嗎?
You think he'll ever come back?

39
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,560
- 是你會嗎? - 他會回來的
- Would you? - He'll come back.

40
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,230
只是不知道當他回來時 會是什麼樣子
I just don't know what he's gonna look like when he does.

41
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,180
當他準備回來的時候 我們只需要在那埵u候著
We just need to be there for him when he's ready.

42
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,360
我沒能遵守對Haley的承諾
You know, i broke my promise to haley.

43
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,440
什麼承諾?
What promise?

44
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,300
我告訴她我會抓住Foyet
I told her that i would catch foyet and that i'd...

45
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,430
然後用我剩餘的生命來補償她
Spend the rest of my life making it up to her.

46
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,000
你依然可以 你救了Jack
You still can. You saved jack.

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,880
你知道 可能我幹這行有一套
You know, i may have the tools to do this job,

48
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,140
可不知道 幫助兒子 我是不是也有一套
But i don't know if i have the tools to help my son.

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,900
問問你自己 想成為怎樣的父親
You have to ask yourself what kind of father you want to be.

50
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,840
當你明白這點的時候
And when you figure that out...

51
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,200
你就知道該怎麼做了
Then you'll know what to do.

52
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,730
我今天說的話是認真的 生活改變了
I meant what i said today. Things have changed.

53
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,200
我必須為Jack作出最好的安排
And i need to do what's best for jack.

54
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,610
你會的

55
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,230
他們不該召集我們 不能是今晚
They can't be calling us in, not tonight.

56
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,200
我跟他們說說

57
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,100

這不是偶然的
That's not a coincidence.

87
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,640
這些女性很可能象徵著他認識的某個人
These women most likely represent someone he knows.

88
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,170
我們要弄清不明嫌犯是在哪 遇見這些受害人的
All right, so we need to figure out where this unsub is meeting his victims

89
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,900
又是怎麼進入她們家的
And how he's gaining access to their homes.

90
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,710
如果他按照這個模式來 很有可能他已經選好了下一個目標
And if he's staying on pattern, Most likely this guy has picked out his next target.

Two prominent women killed on my watch and everyone knows we're bracing for a third.

這兒
In here.

110
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,470
我需要向媒體發佈一份聲明
I'm gonna need to issue a statement with the press.

111

納什維爾的每個女性 都該知道有個連環殺手在逃
Every woman in nashville needs to know there's a serial killer on the loose.

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,550
我們需要她們採取預防措施 以免成為兇手的下一個目標
We need them taking preventative measures to avoid becoming his next target.

113
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,670
市長覺得我們應該盡量精確

每一位女性 探長

他的前兩個受害者可能 來自同一個社會階層
His first 2 victims may be from the same social class,

116
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,310
但如果我們這麼快就把受害人群隔離
But if we isolate victimology this soon,

117
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,580
可能會導致兇手 跨出自己的習慣作案範圍
It may cause him to go outside of his own comfort zone,

118
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,840
這樣就更難追蹤他了
And then he'll be even harder to track.

119
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,330
最好加強警覺 把他和 所有可能的受害者徹底隔離 你覺得呢?
Better to stress hypervigilance and shut down his victim pool completely, don't you think?

120
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,380
好的 長官
Yes, ma'am.

121

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,130
他殺了狗 把它藏在車庫的儲藏室
He killed the dog, hid it in a storage container in the garage.

124
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,610
她可能認為他是正當防衛
She probably thought he was protection enough.

125
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,360
那是她第一個錯誤
That was her first mistake.

126
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,960
她擁有所有預防兇手入室的措施 只是沒有合理運用
She had all the precautions to avoid home invasion, she just didn't use them properly.

127
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,160
這些指紋與另一犯罪現場的指紋吻合
These are the prints that match the other crime scene.

128
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,750
看起來他並不介意 把它們弄得到處都是
It looks like he didn't hesitate to get them everywhere.

129
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,450
這顯然表明 他非常混亂
Which typically would indicate that he's disorganized.

130
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,980
可這個現場 卻處處體現著條理
This crime scene screams of organization.

131
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,040
玫瑰花 那狗
The roses, the dog.

132
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,980
對這女人來說 他是個陌生人
He was a stranger to these women.

133
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,880
他沒有匆忙行動 而是早有準備
He didn't talk his way in, he was laying in wait.

134
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,530
而且他知道 系統堥S有他的指紋
And he knew his prints wouldn't show up in the system.

135
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,050
他沒有前科 這意味著他很聰明 很有可能受過教育
He had no priors, which means he was smart and most likely educated.

136
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,480
他很清楚自己在做什麼 並確保自己有足夠的時間完成
This guy knew exactly what he was doing and he made sure he had enough time to do it.

137
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,340
所以 他知道她什麼時候離開家 什麼時候回來
So, he knew when she'd leave the house and when she'd return.

138
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,400
他在跟蹤她們
He's stalking them.

139
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,990
大門外側把手上只有受害者的指紋
It's only the victim's prints on the exterior doorknobs.

140
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,480
窗戶上啥也沒有 車庫也沒有強行進入的痕跡
Nothing on the windows, the garage wasn't forced.

141
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,760
那他怎麼進來的呢?
So how did he get in?

142
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,140
兩名女性身上都有防禦傷
Defensive wounds on both women.

143
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,110
最近受害者的防禦傷多一些
More so on the latest victim.

144
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,080
她竭力反抗
She fought back the hardest.

145
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,320
沒有捆綁痕跡 她們沒有被捆起來
No ligature marks. They weren't bound.

146
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,170
那他怎麼阻止她們逃跑呢?
So how does he keep them from running out?

147
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,000
也許他堵住了所有逃跑路線 或者 拿把刀威脅就足夠了
Maybe he blocked the escape route, or maybe the threat of a knife was enough.

148
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,620
這一點我倒是挺清楚
I might be able to answer that.

149
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,420
- 刀刺傷不是唯一的傷處 - 什麼意思?
- The stab wounds weren't the only injuries. - What do you mean?

150
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,020
Melissa Johnson有腦震盪
Melissa johnson had a concussion.

151
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,500
Bethany Heminger有一根肋骨骨折
Bethany heminger, a broken rib.

152
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,920
他毆打她們 證明自己才是主宰 讓她們害怕到不敢嘗試逃跑
Annitial assault to prove his domince, make sure they're too scared to try and escape.

153
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,260
還有點東西你們得看看
Something else you should see.

154
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,650
兩個受害人的胃部殘留物都一樣
Both their stomach contents were theame.

155
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,610
雞肉 西蘭花 意大利面 沙拉 和紅酒
Chicken, broccoli, pasta, salad, and red wine.

156
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,780
他是在實施自己的幻想
He's playing out a fantasy.

157
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,970
在這個幻想 他掌控一切
One he has to control.

158
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,460
他用花瓣 美酒佈置現場 還給她們做吃的
He sets the scene with flower petals and wine and then he cooks for them.

159
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,610
她們最後的晚餐
Their last supper.

160
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,820
他做飯 之後又收拾乾淨
So he cooked, and he cleaned up after himself.

161
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,850
卻唯獨留下這些花瓣?
Why did he leave the petal trail?

162
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,030
這對不明嫌犯來說 一定意義重大
It's gotta mean something our guy.

163
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,450
他不止是重溫幻想 更在不斷重複
He's not just reliving a fantasy, he's repeating it.

164
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,670
一樣的步驟 一樣的食物
It's the same routine, the same meal.

165
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,260
這不只是簡單的步驟 而是妥善的禮儀
It's not just routine, it's proper etiquette.

166
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,790
- 什麼? - 看下這個
- What? - Take a look at this.

167
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
椅子後側中部 有個手印
There's a handprint in the center back of this chair right here.

168
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,510
他是為自己挪的這椅子
He pulled this chair out for himself.

169
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,910
而這張椅子呢 手印在兩邊
Over here, there are handprints on either side of the chair.

170
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,220
他為她拉開椅子 為她倒酒...
He pulled this chair out for her, poured her wine...

171
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,940
吃完後 甚至還一一清理
And even cleaned up after the meal was done.

172
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,520
- 但到了這 有些改變 - 他讓她洗澡
- But up here something changed. - Then he drew her a bath.

173
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,480
Messa Johnson就是在這被殺的
And this is where messa johnson was murdered.

174
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,520
這是幻想終結的地方
This is where the fantasy ended.

175
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,820
因為她打破了幻想麼?
Because she broke it?

176
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,750
- 要我肯定會 - 什麼意思?
- I would. - What do you mean?

177
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,650
在樓下第一次被襲擊後 沒錯 我是害怕了
Well, after the initial asult downstairs, fine, i'm scared,

178
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,410
但仍會尋找機會逃跑
But i'm still looking for another chance to escape.

179
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,950
晚餐 美酒 佳餚
Dinner, wine, dishes.

180
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,280
沒有近在眼前的生命危險 可以從容不迫 等待時機
I'm not in any immediate danger, so i c take my time, wait for the right momt.

181
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,070
我按他的吩咐來 是不想再被他傷害
I do what he says because i don't want him to hurt me again.

182
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,500
但當他把我帶來這堮 我處於最勢單力薄的情境
But once he gets me in here, i am at my most vulnerable.

183
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,440
於是恐懼壓過理智 拚命一搏
So fear takes over and e fights back.

184
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,590
因為如果她不搏...
Because if she doesn't...

185
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,550
家應該是安身處
Home is where you're suosed to feel safe.

186
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,700
怎麼能被奪走安全
Nobody deserves to have that taken away.

187
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,400
對了 踢進去!
All right, right in there!

188
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,640
嘿 小鬼 PJs動畫開始了哦
Hey, buddy, it time for pjs.

189
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,990
我能再看一次嗎?
Can i watch one more time?

190
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,010
我在等媽咪過來
I'm waiting for mommy.

191
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,000
好了 準備好許願了嗎?
All right, ready to make a wish. Ok.

192
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,480
1... 2...
1... 2...

193
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,240
好棒哦! 生日快樂 說'嗨 爸爸'
Nice job! Ok. Happy birthday. Say, hi, daddy.

194
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,040
嗨 爸爸
Hi, daddy.

195
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,210
- 我們親他一口 - 我也想她
- let's give him a big kiss. - I miss her, too.

196
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,780
我能再在你房間睡覺嗎?
Can i sleep in your ro again?

197
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,580
當然可以了
Sure.

198
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,020
好的 來吧
ok, come on.

199
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,420
有什麼發現沒?
Find anything?

200
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,400
這兩處房子 都有好幾個人能進出
Several people hadccess to each home.

201
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,590

Housekeeper, gardener, pool cleaner, dog walker, each with their n key and an alibio match.

202
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,350
- 有交叉點嗎? - 絲毫沒有
- Any cross-over? - None.

203
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,500
我們甚至調查了快遞員和公共服務人員
We even vetted delivery people anutility workers.

204
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,660
Garcia 你有發現麼?
Garcia, do you have anything?

205
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,300
系統堻s指紋的影子都查不到
There's no hits on the prints at all,

206
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,000
我按Derek長官的吩咐 建了一份書面追蹤記錄
But i did wh sir derek there asked and i created a paper trail.

207
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,690
謀殺案前的所有時間 兩名受害者間都沒有交集
There's no crossver between the two victims themlves in the wee leading up to their murders,

208
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,520
- 但她們所處的圈子很類似 - 什麼意思?
- But they did run in similar circles. - How do you mean?

209
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,720
她們都是鄉村俱樂部的會員 但分屬於不同的俱樂部
They both have cntry club memberships, though to different clubs.

210
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,750

They went to upscale restaurants, private concert venues, posh hotels.

211
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,870
她們享受著奢華誇張的生活方式 相當燒錢
They enjoyed a high-class, highfalutin lifestyle, an expensive one.

212
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,470
他一下就能融入那種生活方式
A lifestyle he'd fit right into.

213
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,650
這男人受過教育 聰明 正派

214
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,110
是個十足的紳士
He's a downright gentleman.

215
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,120
玫瑰花瓣清楚地說明這一點
The rose petals sent a pretty specific message.

216
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,790
不管她們願不願意 他都和她們玩浪漫
He's romancinghem whether they want it or not.

217

218
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,100
嘿 Garcia 查一下約會服務和社交網站
Hey, garcia, take a look at dating services and social networking sites.

219

查找專業人員和富家子弟
Look for working professionals and privilegedlite.

220
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,500
核對 核對 再核對 一無所獲
Check, check, and checkers. Back in a smidge.

221
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,470
我們需要更多資料
We need more.

222
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,820
我們搞明白他是怎麼進屋的了嗎?
Have we figured out how he's getting into these homes?

223
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,510
到處都沒有強行進入的痕跡
No sign of forced entry anywhe.

224
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,540
但是他仍能在遇害者下班回家之前 早早地進入屋子
Yet he's sti gaining access to their homes long before the victims ever get home from work.

225
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,770
因為他需要時間做飯 佈置現場
I mean, this guy needs timeo cook and set up his scene.

226
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,180
他要麼有鑰匙 要麼就有穿牆術
He's either got a key or he can move through walls.

227
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,000
我們得用新的眼光看問題
We need fresh eyes.

228
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,070
好了 聽著 所有人回酒店休息下
T, listen . I want everybody to go back to the hotel And try to get some rest.

229
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,950
我們明天早上繼續
We're gonna have to pick this up again in the morning.

230
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,330
- 這就放棄了? - 不是 我們休息一下
- We're giving up? - No. We're gonna take a break.

231
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,190
明天早班我們要給出側寫 葬禮到現在還沒人合過眼
We have to give the profile at morning roll and none of us has slept nce the funeral.

232
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,160
一旦Garcia能給出書面追蹤記錄 我們就能把網撒得廣一些
Once garcia can get us a paper trail, then we can expand our canvass.

233
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,960
在那之前 我們沒什麼能做的
Till then ere's really not a lot we can do.

234
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,480
你能關掉音樂嗎?
Would you please turn the music off?

235
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,660
但這是你最喜歡的歌
But it's your farite song.

236
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,000
你怎麼知道的?
How do you know that?

237
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,290
這是你iPod媦蔗韘蜈く怞h的歌曲
It's the most playedong on your ipod.

238
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,860
不! 不! 不!

239
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,730
別亂跑
Stop it.

240
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,180
你把氣氛給毀了
You're ruining it.

241
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,960
對不起 我不跑了 求你了
I'sorry. I won't do it again. Ease.

242
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,940
我會按你的吩咐做
I'll do whever you want.

243
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,430
我花了好多時間和精力 準備這個與眾不同的夜晚
ve put a lot of time and effort into making this a special night.

244
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,850
要你欣賞就那麼難嗎?
Is it too much to ask for a little appreciation?

245
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,330
對不起 我不會再跑了 求你了
I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Please.

246
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,310
我會聽你的吩咐
I'll do whatever you wan.

247
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,770
好吧 我原諒你
that'sok.I forgive you.

248
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,180
小誤會 對吧?
A little misunderstanding, right?

249
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,960
是的 沒錯
Yes. That's right.

250
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,380
我會忘記剛才的事
I'll just forget all about this.

251
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,530
是的 求你了
Yes, please.

252
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,020
現在...
Now...

253
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,220
你該洗澡了
I think it's t for your bath.

254
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,800
Jack 聽著 我要你想好 把玩具放哪堨h 好嗎?
Ok, jack, listen, i want you to figure out where you want to put all your toys, ok?

255
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,370
- 好的 爸爸 - 好的 乖寶貝
- Ok, daddy. - Alright, sweet boy.

256
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,400
Strauss主任 感謝你能過來
Chief strauss, i appreciate your coming to me.

257
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,580
噢 沒事 這關頭總不能讓你離開你兒子
Oh, of course. This isn't a time for you to be away from your son.

258
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,360
請進
Come in.

259
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,710
Jack 能和Strauss主任打招呼嗎?
Jack, can you say llo to chief strauss?

260
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,760
嗨 Jack
Hi, jack.

261
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,020
請坐
Have a seat.

262
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,440
那麼 你怎麼樣?
So, how are you holding up?

263
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,900
- 我還好 - Jack怎麼樣?
- I'm ok. - And how's jack?

264
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,700
他還過得去 我覺得他還不明白所有的事情
He's coping. I don't think he fully understands everything that's going on.

265
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,350
得了 他怎麼會全明白呢?
Oh, right, well, how could he?

266
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,590
小雪人大行動 (動畫電影)...
Knick knack...

267
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,970
你說有事找我商量?
You said that there was something you wanted to discuss with me?

268
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,360
是的
Yes, i do.

269
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,610
這是要我退休
Thiss retirement.

270
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,390
我已經和上頭商量過了
I've talked with the director.

271
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,760
出了這樣的事 你不一定非得回來工作
Given the circumstances, there's no reason you should have to return to the bureau.

272
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,330
我們可以提供全額退休金和福利待遇
We can offer you full pension and benefits.

273
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,220
你是要我離開局媔?
Are saying that you want me to leave the bau?

274
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,630
當然這還是由你來決定 不過 我這是給你條路
Well, obviously that's your choice, but i'm offering you a way out.

275
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,920
Morgan探員的升職只是暫時的 不過他的表現超出了我們的預期
Agent moan's protion was temporary, but he's exceeded our expectations,

276
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,650
如果你決定退位 我也有能力讓他待在這個位子上
And i'm confident that i could make it permanent, if you decide to step down.

277
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,250
隊員們既可以團結一致 你也可以多陪陪你兒子
The team would be together and you could be with your son.

278
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,140
要我什麼時候作出決定?
And when would you like a decision?

279
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,870
我想你現在就答覆我
I thought i would be leavi with one.

280
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,620
你還有什麼可猶豫的呢?
What's your hesitation?

281
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,390
我只想把所有選擇都好好考慮下
I would just like to weigh all of my options.

282
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,500
那也行
Whatever you need.

283
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,530
我們認為不明嫌犯 已經找到下一個受害人了
We believe our unsub is already th his next victim.

284
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,120
如果他符合我們側寫的類型 受害人就應該是事業成功型女性
If he matches pattern, she'll be a successful woman,

285
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,220
很可能是深褐色頭髮 30歲出頭到40多歲
Probably brunette, early 30s to mid-40s.

286
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,340
她應該住在納什維爾的高檔區
She'll be at home in nashville's upper echelon.

287
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,590
也就是說 他能融入這個社區
This mea that he fits in.

288
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,070
他會開高檔的車 穿高檔的衣服 智力超群
Herives the right car, he wears the right clothes, he's highly intelligent.

289
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,000
很可能有點社會地位
He probably comes fr a place of status.

290
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,450
這個人善於交際 討人歡心
This guy's sociable, and he's endearing.

291
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,950
讓你永遠想不到他會殺人
You would never suspect that this man is capable of murder.

292
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,230
但他會不惜任何代價重溫自己的幻想
But he will do whatever it takes to protect the fantasy that he's trying to relive.

293
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,310
就是這個幻想給了他動力
It's this fantasy which fuels his drive.

294
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,880
他重現了一個浪漫的夜晚 並和每個受害人共同參與
He's recreating a romantic evening and repeating it with each of his victims.

295
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,550
很有可能他最近剛結束了一段感情
He most likely recently had a relationship taken away from him.

296
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,800
所以我們應該關注下那些最近 剛痛失愛人或離婚的男性
So look at men who have lost loved ones or have gone through a messy divorce.

297
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,790
不過和Bundy一樣 這些女性受害人 只代表了他真實生活中痛失的女性
But like bundy, these women are representations of that first loss.

298
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,930
Bundy選中的女性都擁有和 當初拋棄他的女人一樣的特徵
Bundy picked victims who had similar features to the woman that abandoned him,

299
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,660
所以我們認為 這個不明嫌犯也是一樣
And we believe that our unsub is doing the exact same thing.

300
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,010
這些女性都是自信堅強的成功女性 她們會反抗
These women were cfident, successful, and strong, and they fought back.

301
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,590
既然不名嫌犯能輕易控制住她們 他一定很有手段
Which means he has the ability to overpower them fairly easily.

302
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,190
他認為或幻想自己和她們處於愛戀中
He believes or fantasizes he's in a relationship with these woman.

303
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,970
不論他們最初的相識是多麼短暫 對他來說都很重要
No matter how fleeting the initial interaction is, it's everything to him.

304
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,190
也就是一次邀約
An invitation.

305
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,760
我們的技術分析師 已經搜集了一些地點
Our technical analyst has compiled a list of locations

306
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,790
受害人在死前可能去過的
that the victims visited prior toheir death.

307
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,850
都是些高檔場所
These are high-class establishments.

308
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,680
我們也要去調查下這些地方
We're going to want to visit the same places.

309
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,940
看有沒有男的符合側寫 有沒有女性符合受害人的類型
So, look for men who fit the profile, but also women who match victimology.

310
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,910
如果有人特別引人注意 就找來談談
If somebody's been paying a little too much attention to them, talk to them.

311
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,230
問下名字 記下來 我們再回來查
Get a read, then jot tir name down so that we can check them out.

312
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,290
好了 夥計們 整理下自己要查的地方 都行動起來
All right, folks, pick up your canvassing assignments and get to work.

313
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,120
謝謝
Thank you.

314

After we made love last night, you'd realize how much you mean to me.

325

你難道不相信我嗎 Joe?
Don't you trust me, joe?

326
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,290
- 誰來了? - 我不知道
- Who's that? - I have no idea.

327

Erika Silverman的屍體呢?
Where's erika silverman's body?

348
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,760
他改變了自己的慣用手法

臉部和頸部多處刺傷

典型的過度殺人

351
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,490
有證據表明她死之前有過性行為
And evidence that she had sex before she died.

352
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,830
強迫的還是自願的?
Forced or consensual?

353
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,750
沒有證據是性侵犯
No evidence of sexual assault.

354
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,410
她陪他演下去了
She played along.

355
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,030
她和不明嫌犯發生性行為 她想這樣就不會死
She had sex th the unsub because she thought it would keep her alive.

356
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,730
那為什麼會這樣?
So why didn't it?

357
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,970
這次殺人帶有憤怒和針對個人的情緒
This kill is personal, angry.

358
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,260
他想要的東西她沒能全部給他
She didn't give him everything that he wanted.

359
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,320
他要的還不夠多麼?

360
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,790
昨晚吃飯的餐具洗過了 但早餐盤卻沒有

他這次沒有收拾乾淨
He didn't cln up this time.

362
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,120
男友的出現肯定讓他很震驚 打亂了他計劃
The boyfriend must have surprised him and disrupted his routine.

363
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,440
我不太明白 我覺得他差不多都做完了
I don't know, i'd say he came pretty close to finishing it.

364
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,830

It looks like they watched aovie, had an early breakfast.

365

她整晚都和他在一起
She was with him all night.

366
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,250
- 嘿 Garcia - 壞消息 美人
- Hey, garcia. - Bad news, buttercup.

367

社交網站記錄上沒有什麼支出
No payoff on the social networng sites,

369
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,870
這個Erika Silverman也沒有任何的不良記錄

370
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,430
除了一些網購信息和自動生成的賬戶支出
Aside from a couple of online purchases and some automatic debits,

371
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,450
她整一周都沒用過她的信用卡

嘿 Garcia找不到這一周來有關 Erika Silverman下落的信息
O, garcia couldn't find anything about erika silverman's whereabouts over the past week.

沒去購物 沒去餐廳 什麼都沒有
No stores, no restaurants, nothing.

375
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,130
沒準還有別的辦法知道她去了哪
Thermay actually be another way to figure out where she's been.

376
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,120
知道受害者的車都去哪了麼?
Do we know where any of the victims' cars are?

377
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,800
據我所知都扣起來了
As far as i know, they're in impound.

378
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,160
- 咱得查查那4輛車 - 4輛?
- We need access to all 4 of them. - 4?

379
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,550
還得查Grant Franklin的車
We should also get grant franklin's car.

380
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,050
他可能開車載Erika去了什麼地方 然後遇見了兇手
He may have driven erika somewhere where she met the unsub.

381
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,120
<i>******</i>

382
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,170
在對受害者的分析中我們肯定漏掉了什麼
There has to be something in the victimology.

383
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,480
當時如果不是Grant Franklin正好回家 Erika現在可能還活著
If grant franklin hadn't come home when he did, ika would probably still be alive.

384
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,680
那麼兇手怎麼可能忽略了他呢?
So how did the unsub miss him?

385
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,560
上面說他上周去印第安納波利斯 看望家人了
It says he was out of town last week visiting family in indianapolis.

386
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,240
可下手如此兇狠 表明兩個受害者他都認識
Still, the violence of those kills indicates he knew both victims.

387
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,650
因為受害者和兇手待的時間越長 他下手的時候就越狠
'Cause the longer victims are with theiller, the more desperate the attack.

388
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,700
兇手在Erika Silverman臉上劃了17刀
The unsub stabbed erika silverman 17 times in the face,

389
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,130
在Grant Franklin臉上和生殖器上捅了34刀
grant franklin 34 times to the face and genitals.

390
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,330
很好理解 計劃得越周詳 越會花時間在上面
It makes sense. The more he perfects his routine, he more invested he becomes.

391
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,000
Kaminski警官 你的人找到受害者 最後去過的地方了麼?
Detective kaminski, have your men had any luck canvassing the victims' last known whereabouts?

392
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,720
沒有 我打算晚上就讓他們撤了
None. I'm thinking of pulling them off for the night.

393
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,690
- 這可不行 - 為什麼? 受害人已經死了
- That's a mistake. - Why is that? The vic's dead.

394
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,490
如果他按他的模式來的話 等他下次行動我們還有一周的時間
If he sticks to the pattern, we've got another week before he strikes again.

395
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,220
因為他以前沒得到過這麼多
Because he's never gotten this far before.

396
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,500
他極度需要再一次實現他的幻想
He's desperate to ay out his fantasy.

397
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,030
到了這一步 他可不會按行動時間表來了
A man like this isn't gonna stick to any timetle.

398
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,090
他今晚就會再次行動
He's gonna try to finish this tonight.

399
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,790
JJ 你去開發佈會 縮小受害者範圍
Jj, we need you on the news. Narrow victimology.

400
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,670
告訴大家他仍然逍遙法外
Let people know that he's out there right now.

401
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,920
沒問題
I'm on it.

402
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,410
我們還是不能確定 他是怎麼找上受害者的
We still don't know where he's finding his victims.

403
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,800
但我們知道 Erika Silverman住在Green Hills
But we do know that erika silverman lived in green hills.

404
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,320
這樣就有了三個點 我們可以定位容易下手的區域了
That's 3 points and we finally have our geographical comfort zone.

405
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,250
也就是說 兇手就在這個區域的某個地方
It's a good bet the unsub lis somewhere in this area,

406
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,300
而Erika就是我們找出 他們在哪相遇的關鍵
And erika is our key to figuring out where they met.

407
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,670
噢 天 晚餐吃薄烤餅 還能有更好的嗎?
Oh, man, pancakes for dinner. Is there anything better?

408
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,750
不 沒有
No, ere's not.

409
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,190
嘿 Jack 這些人是誰?
Hey, jack, who are these guys?

410
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,320
這是你 這是壞人 他們在打架
This is you, and this is the bad guy. They're fighting.

411
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,860
那誰贏了 Jack?
Who wins, jack?

412
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,670
爸爸 沒人能戰勝我老爸
Daddy. No one beats daddy.

413
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,020
嘿 Jack Jessica阿姨差不多要做好飯了
Hey, jack. Aunt jessica's almost got dinner ready.

414
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,300
你告訴我 我們吃飯前該怎麼做?
I forgot, what do we do before we eat?

415
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,930
- 洗手 - 很好 去吧
- Wash our hands. - good job.Come on.

416
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,650
爸爸...
Daddy...

417
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,170
他自己想像出的那些 但願沒什麼問題
He built those himself. I hope it's ok.

418
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,040
當然
Of course.

419
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,310
聽著 我很感謝你過來
Listen, i really appreciate your coming over.

420
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,430
幫助和支持我們 實在是太好了
All your help and support, it's been great.

421
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,480
他是我的侄子 你是我的家人
He's my nephew, and you're my family.

422
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,850
只要你需要 我就來幫忙
I'll be here as much as you want.

423
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,670
局媗我退休
The bureau has offered me retirement.

424
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,460
那你怎麼說?
What did you tell them?

425
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,480
你知道 Jack比以前更需要我
You know, jack needs me now more than ever.

426
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,670
也就是說必須全天候在這兒
That means being here full-time.

427
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,820
Haley跟我分開之後 他沒怎麼跟我在一起 這很讓人難過
After haley and i were apart, he didn't havee very much, and that was hard,

428
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:53,230
但我知道他至少還有他媽媽 而現在 他正需要的是爸爸
I knew that at least he had his mom and right now he really needs his dad.

429
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,480
當然 Aaron
Ofourse he does, aaron.

430
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,550
你我都知道 你和Haley分開 並不是因為不再愛對方
We both know you and haley didn't separate beuse you stopped loving each other.

431
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,890
是工作成了個中阻礙
Your job just got in the way.

432
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,650
你的團隊需要你 即使讓你退休 他們還是需要你
Your team needed you, and despite this offer, i doubt that's changed.

433
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,160
或許你根本不用退休
Maybe you don't need to retire.

434
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,720
如果你不在的時候 我留下來照顧Jack呢?
What if i stayed with jack when you had to be away?

435
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,410
Jessica 我很感激你...
Jessica, i appreciate that...

436
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,420
拜託...
Please...

437
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,040
對我來說 讓我照顧Jack 也很重要
It would mean a lot to me if you'd let me help you out with jack.

438
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,950
為了Haley
For haley.

439
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,980
Garcia查到了些東西
Garcia's got something.

440
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,920
我簡直是個天才 看看我做了什麼
I'm a real genius 'cause this is what i di.

441
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,000
我從GPS系統堿d到了行程日誌
i took the travel logs from the gps sysms,

442
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,560
把他們的所有行程 覆蓋到地理側寫上 得出了書面追蹤查不到的信息
Overlaid their routes againsthe geographical profile to reveal what the paper trail could not.

443
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,670
是什麼呢?
Which was?

444
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,760
Erika Silverman是唯一個沒有去過 任何可能引來殺身之禍的酒吧 音樂會
While erika silverman is the only victim who didn't visit a private club, a concert,

445
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,270
或者什麼惟妙餐廳的受害者
Or go to a fancy restaurant in the days leading upo her death,

446
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,090
但週二 她卻在Cheekwood的 植物園塈b了一陣
She did spend a couple of hours at cheekwood botanical gardens on tuesday.

447
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,640
Garcia 其他的受害者也去過那個公園?
Garcia, did either of the other victims go to the park?

448
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,000
- 沒有 - 那我不覺得和這案子有什麼關繫了
- No. - I don't know if it's relevant, then.

449
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,090
當她的導航系統直線導航時 就有關聯了
It is when her navigation system reads in a straight line.

450
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,870
上班 回家 上班 回家 我認為她都沒走出過屋子
To work, back home, to work, back home. I don't think she ever left her house.

451
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,000
連生活日用她都要送貨上門
She even had her groceries delivered.

452
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,130
週二時她在做什麼?
What washe doi on tuesday?

453
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,480
一起查查吧
Let's find out.

454
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,610
人都到哪兒去了?
Where is everybody?

455
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,170
JJ和Reid追著一條線索查呢 Prentiss正在和Kaminski警官重新檢查
Well, jj and reid are checking on a lead, and prentiss is recanvassing with detective kaminski.

456
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,780
很好 那我們能聊聊了
Good. Then wcan talk.

457
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,860
Rossi...
Rossi...

458
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,220
這是他的團隊
It's his team.

459
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,200
我不會成為阻礙的
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.

460
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,840
- 不一定會像你說的 - 什麼意思?
- It might not come to that. - What do you mean?

461
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,310
Strauss為他提供了退休的機會
Strauss offered him retirement.

462
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,720
他不會接受的
He'll never accept it.

463
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,800
不要這麼肯定 這份工作犧牲了他的妻子
Don't be so sure. This job cost him his wife.

464
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,340
很久以前就發生了
It cost him that a long time ago.

465
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,310
這就是為什麼 他不會再犧牲他的兒子了
Which is why he won't let it cost him his son.

466
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,640
你認為他會怎麼做?
What do you think he'll do?

467
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,860
我怎麼想不重要
It doesn't matter what i think.

468
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,660
重要的是如果他回來了 你願意卸任麼?
What matters is whether you'll be willing to step down if he comes back.

469
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,140
或者是在他不願意回來時繼任
Or step up if heoesn't.

470
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,420
我會按Hotch需要的去做 他已經失去太多了
I'm gonna do whatever hotch needs me to do. He's lost enough.

471
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,610
Rossi 介意過來下嗎? 我有點東西要給你看看
Hey, rossi. You mind coming here for second? I want to throw something at you.

472
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,210
我們對兇手的側寫表明 他最近經歷了失去
We profiled that our unsub recently experienced a loss as well.

473
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,460
失去了他深愛的人 或許是和被害者 有著相同背景的的深褐髮色女性
A loved one. Probably a brunette who ran in the same circles as his victi.

474
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,680
對
Right.

475
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,010
如果愛情並不是他唯一失去的呢?
What if love wasn't the only loss?

476
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,140
我們這樣假設 是因為兇手能輕易地 跟蹤受害人的上層生活
I mean, we assumed that because our unsub could so easily navigate our victims' upscale world

477
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,550
說明他很有可能和受害者 有著相同的收入來源
That he most likely shared the same financial resources as his victims.

478
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,490
因為他的教養 他優雅的舉止
Because of his upbringing, his sophisticated behavior.

479
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,660
但是這種行為舉止是根深蒂固的 就是一種習慣
But that behavior is ingrained in him. It's habit.

480
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,650
是他從小就學到的 不是長大了才會的
It something he would have learned as a child, not as an adt.

481
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,930
如果他並沒有經濟獨立 但仍在試圖維持他的社會地位
If he didn't have financial independence but were still trying to keep up his social status,

482
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,590
他的資金會大量流失
He'd be hemorrhaging funds.

483
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,820
我們查錯方向了Rossi
We've been looking at this the wrong way, rossi.

484
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,020
我們調查了女傭 園丁 清潔泳池的 能進入房子的每一個人
We vetted the maids, the gardeners, the pool cleaners, anyone who had access to the houses,

485
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:26,230
但還有哪個人能不引人注意地 進入上流社會的圈子?
But who else might go unnoticed in a privileged society?

486
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,610
這堿OGarcia
Garcia here.

487
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,940
Garcia 檢查下 每個受害者死前一個星期
Garcia, eck employee records at each of the venues

488
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,810
所去場所的員工記錄
the victims visited in the week prior to their dth.

489
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,310
查找那些入不敷出
Look f men spending beyond their means.

490
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,430
負債纍纍的人 Garcia
A guy who's racked up a lot of debt, garcia.

491
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,420
注意車子 服飾等不符合他收入水平的東西
Look at cars, wardrobes, something that does not fit their current income level.

492
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,250
可能是在提供獎學金的私人學校 接受的教育
A scholarship-funded private school education maybe.

493
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,260
正如你們所見 公園能吸引各種遊人
As you can see the park attracts a variety of patrons.

494
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,350
老夫老妻 散步的人 旅行團
Older couples, walkers, tour groups.

495
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,950
我們會在上面的草坪 不定期的舉行婚禮或者是演唱會
We'll hold an occasional wedding or concert sers on our upper lawn.

496
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,070
上個星期二有什麼活動嗎?
Did you have any events here past tuesday?

497
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,840
週二
Tuesday.

498
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,520
4點到7點之間我們舉行了一場社團募捐
Oh, we had a corporate fund-raiser between 4:00 and 7:00.

499
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,730
就是Erika Silverman在場的時候
That's when erika sierman was here.

500
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,820
要讓高跟鞋女士們來這兒參加活動 簡直比強行推銷還難
An event up here would be a hard sell for women in heels.

501
