00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,200
ST.LOUIS,MISSOURI

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,880
Ok.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,340
Oh!

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,650
It is notjust me,right?

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,630
- Our girl'sgot an arm.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,720
Oh.
Just like her dad.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,960
Look at her.
We blinkedand 4 years went by.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,210
So,what do you think?
Should we do this again?

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,080
Sounds like a plan.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,700
Uh-oh.
Who's coming?Aah!

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,660
Ah.So,what doyou think,katie?

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,750
You want a littlebrother or sister?
Yeah?Well...

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,250
the boss has spoken.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,820
Ok.Well,you go get her,
and I'll go get lunch.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,040
Ok.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,230
My daughter molly.
She's 6.

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,660
She's got braids,yellow sweatshirt.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,600
- What am I gonna do?
- Ok,ok.Calm down.

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,500
Braids,yellow sweatshirt.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,830
We were playing hideand seek up here.
She must have gotten lost in the trees.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,500
Oh,god.
I'm so stupid.

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,680
Tom!
Tom!

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,690
Shh,shh,shh!
Wait.

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,310
Did you hear that?
It came from over here.

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,430
Molly?
Honey?!

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,440
Daddy's here.

27
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,450
Molly.

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,710
No.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,720
Did you find molly?
Is she ok?

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,130
Mommy,wake up.
It's past 10:00.

31
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,800
Ah!Damn it.
Why did you let me sleep?

32
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,290
Why don't you getan alarm clock?

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,710
- Did you eat?
- Pizza.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,660
- And the baby?
- Pizza.And milk.

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,420
Get some sleep,jay.

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,260
Hey,I'll bring yousome pancakes.

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,360
Yeah.
When?

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,240
Hi.
Want company?

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,170
Hi.

40
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,170
F.B.I. Headquarters
QUANTICO,VIRGINIA

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,700
Come in.

42
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,290
- Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,080
- Agent hotchner?
- Yes.

44
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,080
I'm agentemily prentiss.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,780
How do you do?
Oh,you're ambassadorprentiss' daughter.

46
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,210
I did security clearances
for your mother's staff.

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,170
It was oneof my first commands.

48
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,170
I believe you were off
to brown at the time.

49
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,160
- Actually,it was yale.
- Ah.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,580
I've been in the bureau almost 10 years now.

51
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,330
Don't tell me that.
Has it been that long?

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,390
Apparently,sir.But I work mostly
in the midwest.St.Louis,chicago.

53
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,890
Good.

54
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,500
- Your parents well?
- Yeah,yeah,they're great.

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,880
Excellent.

56
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,740
What can I do for you?

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,690
Uh,well,I guessI was hoping
you could tell mewhere to put my stuff.

58
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,750
I'm sorry?

59
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,090
I'm supposed to starthere today...
at the bau.

60
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,870
There's been a mistake.

61
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,070
- I don't think so,sir.
- There's definitelybeen a mistake.

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,370
Excuse me.
We'regetting started.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,540
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

64
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,130
I didn't approve
this transfer,agent prentiss.

65
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,690
I'm sorry for the confusion,
but you've been misinformed.

66
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,640
But--excuse me.
It's very goodto see you again.

67
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,500
did you approveany transfer?

68
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,520
No.
I would'vediscussed it.

69
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,780
That's what I thought.
She's got the paperworkto join the team.

70
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,730
- You want meto make a call?
- No.I'll make it.

71
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,570
St.Louis is in trouble.

72
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,860
They've got 2 serial killers.

73
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,650
This killer abducts his victims
from public places,dumps them in the woods.

74
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,730
They consulted us months ago
after the third murder.

75
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,260
Well,now it might beup to 6.

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,690
Ellen carroll's been missing
since yesterday.

77
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,890
The first 2 victimswere found near
mill creekin mark twainnational forest.

78
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,620
No wonder it takes daysto find the bodies.

79
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,980
The forestis 1.5 million acres
and 78,000of that is wilderness.

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,490
What's the storywith these women?

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,230
8 victims. All prostitutes.
Latest is marci mitchell.

82
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,410
She was killed last night
with a .44 magnum.

83
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,950
All are tiedto a serial shooter
claiming responsibility.

84
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,550
He's contactedjim meyers,
a reporterat the missouri herald.

85
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,190
So he's not getting
the attention he thinkshe deserves.

86
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,030
He signs itthe hollow man,
names himself for the press.

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,050
Why hollow man?
What,he feel emptyinside or something?

88
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,840
He uses hollow pointbullets.

89
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,430
No one even knewthis guy existed
until he sentthis letter.

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,770
Well,he's killedmore victims,
but lookwho he's chosen.

91
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,380
Hundreds of victimsgo unnoticed because
they'resocial outcastsand never makethe front page.

92
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,460
When mill creek kills,the hollow man
shoots another prostitute.

93
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,670
So one doesn't want to be
outdone by the other.

94
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,570
Sounds likesibling rivalry to me.

95
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,850
They've been killing
independently of eachother for a year now.

96
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,000
Each kill they'relearning something...

97
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,480
from the other.

98
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,440
No Woman is Safe

99
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:47,700
Elbert hubbert once wrote,"if men could only know each other,they would neitheridolize nor hate."

100
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,650
Thank you.

101
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,880
What's wrong?

102
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,440
Did you know there areroughly 30 serial killers
at large in the U.S.At any given time?

103
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,170
It's an incredibly rare occurrence
to have themoperating in the same city.

104
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,240
- How many timeshas that happened?
- To my knowledge,3 times.

105
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,000
There was a guy killing
at the same time as the son of sam.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,190
And then againin new orleans,
and most recentlywith the phoenix murders.

107
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,970
Serial shootersare typically loners.

108
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,560
This guy likesto kill at night.

109
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,780
His victimsare prostitutes,so he may lack confidence
with womenor have poorsocial skills.

110
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,360
No rape.
The guycould be impotent.

111
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,000
He's a wannabetough guy.

112
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,160
It's not hard to be  tough holding a .44.

113
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,140
The gun gives him power and
lets him maintaindistance from the kill.

114
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,480
This guy doesn'twant to touch
the bodieswith his hands.

115
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,800
Mill creek killer.

116
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,810
Hunts during the day, targets
educated,middle-class women.

117
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,970
He'd have to lookand act like they do.

118
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,770
The women die from blunt force head traumas.

119
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,470
This guy wantsto be close,
he wants to feel the lifeleave their bodies.

120
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,420
These guysare polar opposites.

121
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,930
Just like their victims.They live in
the samecity but they'reworlds apart.

122
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,210
I'm gonna see ifthe shooter's victims
have any familiesI can talk to.

123
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,640
That's a good idea.I'm already familiar
with the mill creek case.

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,860
Reid,can you takea look at the letter
for handwriting analysisand psycho linguistics?

125
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,110
- Of course.
- Looks like I'm with you.

126
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,100
I'll go aheadand talk with
ellencarroll's husband.

127
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,620
I'm meeting jim meyers,
the reporterfrom the missouri herald.

128
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,600
Well,tell him not to write about the hollow man.

129
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,440
If we want to drawthe shooter out,
best way to do that isto act like he doesn't exist.

130
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,920
I'd feel much betterwhen you find ellen.

131
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,940
Mr. Carroll,believe me,we are trying.

132
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:37,570
You know,when you have kids,you become so fixated
on where they areand what they're doing,

133
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,410
you don't thinkyou need  to worryabout your spouse.

134
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,770
I understandyour wife is
a partnerat a law firm.

135
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,940
Now aside from work,taking care of the family,
does she make timefor herself?

136
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,160
She's an avid runner,participates in the
st.Louis marathonevery year.

137
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,790
Is she shy,nervous about meeting new people?

138
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,220
Ever since we had katie, I'd say
she'smuch more trusting.

139
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,540
You don't rememberher talking to anyone
you don't knowat that playground?

140
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,930
No.
No one.

141
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,430
How did I not seesomeone take my wife?

142
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,010
Mr. Carroll,the man who did this,
somehow he justfits right in.

143
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,080
He doesn't look or sound like
he doesn't belong.

144
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,750
Oh,hey,little lady.

145
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,250
Hey.

146
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,810
She keeps asking me, when her
mommy'scoming home.

147
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,080
I don't knowwhat to saY.

148
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,360
I missed you.

149
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,160
You are so beautiful.

150
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,210
Agents hotchnerand reid,fbi.

151
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,380
- What do you want?
- We'd like to talk to you.

152
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,980
Hold thatbadge up again.

153
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,630
We're here to talk to you
about marcie mitchell.

154
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,970
- I'm her mother.
- I'm sorryfor your loss,ma'am.

155
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,200
What's this?

156
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,640
They're for me.
Take your brother inside.

157
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,980
- Is this about mom?
- I said inside.

158
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,170
You gonna judge meor ask questions?

159
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,210
Is there anyone who can
help youwith the kids?

160
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,950
Is that whatyou came here for?

161
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,340
Ma'am,we'vejust been assigned your daughter's case.

162
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,120
We're in the processof gathering information,
but so far no witnesseshave come forward.

163
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,130
Well,around here guns go off
like those damn car alarms--every 15 minutes.

164
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,420
Nobody'sstupid enough to talk, nobody cares.

165
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,140
We do.

166
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,170
You wouldn't even behere if
it wasn't for them.

167
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,080
"Heinous crimes against
upstanding membersof the community."

168
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,960
Nobody writes about
prostitutes being shot

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,180
because they won'tadmit they think
they'recleaning up the place.

170
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,690
You're right.

171
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,650
Caseslike your daughter's
usually go unsolved.

172
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,190
The problem is peoplearen't looking for them
because they don't knowthat they're missing.

173
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,390
Part of her job was to
stay below the radar.

174
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,870
Doesn't mean she wasany less important.

175
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,940
She made bad choices.

176
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,410
But she was a good person.

177
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,950
She loved those boys.

178
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,570
Whoever shot her should
pay for what they did.

179
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,160
So don't come in here
and say you're sorry.

180
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,330
Just dosomething about it.

181
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,090
We will,Ma'am.

182
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,320
Hi.
You must beagent sheridan?

183
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,550
- Agent jareau.
- Hi.

184
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,700
- Really appreciateyou coming so quickly.
- Yeah.

185
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,940
Why don't youset up in here?

186
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,460
Oh,wow.You've gotlots of evidence
for the mill creekkiller case.

187
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,750
- What aboutthe hollow man?
- Right here.

188
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,260
There's beenat least 8 women shot.
This is all we've got?

189
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,110
You know thesecases
don't generate much evidence.

190
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,880
All we have at the scene are
a couple of bulletsand no one's talking.

191
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,010
Well,hopefully,we can change that.

192
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,600
Agent jareau,there's
a reporter here to see you.

193
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,500
- Thank you.Excuse me.
- Sure.

194
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,010
Jim meyers.Hi.Agent jareau.
We spoke on the phone.

195
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,390
Hi.
Thanks for stopping by.

196
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,870
Sure.
Here's thatletter I faxed to you.

197
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh,great.

198
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,510
So,did the hollow manshoot those prostitutes
because I wrote aboutthe mill creek victims?

199
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,750
He would've killedthem anyway.

200
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,110
But right now he'slooking for recognition.
That's whyhe's contacted you.

201
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,410
But I'm not in any danger.

202
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,290
I mean,I don't wantto be
staring downthe barrel of a gun.

203
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,860
Right now he needs you.You're his
only hope toget on that front page.

204
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,660
You know,I had no ideaI could get on
a serial killer's radarby writing aboutanother one.

205
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,050
We're going to ask thatyou not print anything relatingto the hollow man orthe women he's killed.

206
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,360
Don't those victimsdeserve just
as much inkas those other women?

207
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,800
Of course they do.

208
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,650
But we needthe shooter
to keep communicatingwith you.

209
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,770
And if you satisfyhis need for attention,
he could disappear,and I'm sorry.

210
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,840
We just can't takethat chance.

211
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,120
Excuse me,agent jareau?

212
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,810
We just found ellencarroll's body.

213
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,570
Agents gideon,morgan,this is agent sheridan.

214
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,130
- How are you?
- Forgive me.

215
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,090
How faris the abduction
itefrom these woods?

216
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,550
About 40 miles or so.

217
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,430
He tried to hide itpretty well.
He covers the bodyvery carefully.

218
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,610
Must feel remorsefor killing them.

219
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,640
This lipstick's beenapplied recently.
It's still moist.

220
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,680
Look at her hair.
It's been brushed,put behind her ears.

221
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,320
She was abducted,what,an hour from here?
Draggedthrough these woods?

222
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,960
Her hair would notlook like that.

223
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,330
So he keeps her safefrom the elements
and then comes backfor the body.

224
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,870
That's why he chooses a
secondary locationthat's so remote.

225
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,600
- This isn'tabout remorse.
- No.

226
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,280
- He wantsto be alone with her.
- Needs his privacy.

227
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,150
You never noticed
the hair or the makeupbefore?

228
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,390
No.
Maybe it wasthe timing.

229
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,230
She was foundwithin 24 hours,and the others
had alreadysuccumbed to the elements.

230
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,470
Sex actswith dead bodies are rare occurrences.

231
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,230
However,bundy did it regularly.

232
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,590
So how is thisgoing to help usto catch him?

233
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,480
Now we knowhe has a ritual.
He needs to defilethe bodies.

234
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,590
Next timewe'll be herewaiting for him.

235
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,210
Sixth Victim Falls to Mill Creek Killer

236
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,180
We're off-duty just like you.

237
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,670
2 victims at once.
That's a first for him.

238
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,000
You think he wentout looking to kill more
than one woman,or is it just happenstance?

239
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,790
He chose a differenthunting ground.

240
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,580
Yes,we're in an alley,but we're behind
an expensive hotelin a nice neighborhood.

241
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,050
You get a differentclass of prostitute,
ones that don't walkthe street alone.

242
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,480
He was lookingfor a challenge.

243
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,610
Question is,what gavehim the confidence
to stray outof his comfort zone?

244
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,110
Make sure to runthat for prints.

245
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,260
He displayed the newspaperbetween them.

246
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,690
He took the time when he
could've just tossed it aside.

247
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,490
It's deliberatE.
He wants us to knowhe's angry.

248
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,180
Angry enoughto change his M.O.

249
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,470
I heard there was a double
homicide this morning.

250
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,720
Was it hollow man?

251
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,260
- Agents are confirmingthat now.
- I've written about him.

252
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,290
There's no guaranteethat he would've stopped
killingif you would've giveninto his demands.

253
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,810
In fact,media attention
could've fueled himto kill more.

254
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,960
We don't knowthat for sure.

255
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,680
This is all justa guessing game,isn't it?

256
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,780
No.
It's behavioralanalysis.

257
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,420
We're dealingwith an offenderwho believes
that murdering peopleis a good wayto become famous.

258
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,320
All I know is thatyou told me to
ignore himand he takes 2 lives.

259
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,090
If I dismissthis double homicide,
what happens tomorrow?

260
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,280
We won't knowuntil then.

261
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,950
Too bad we couldn'ttrace
any printsfrom the newspaper.

262
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,490
What have you got?

263
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,680
he only sent thisto an individual,

264
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,890
which shows he'snot confident enough
to initiate contactwith the masses.

265
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,800
Emotional indicators are analyzed through slants.

266
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,130
The shootermaintains vertical,
narrow-lettered writing,both signs of repression.

267
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,120
And the pressure,if you look closely, is excessively heavy,

268
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,600
which showsthat he's uptight and caneasily overreact.

269
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,000
You got all thatfrom his handwriting?

270
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,480
Graphology is an effectiveand reliable
indicatorof personality and behavior.

271
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,710
My writing'salways different.

272
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,760
That's because itexpresses
your emotionsat that given time,

273
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,370
just likeyour facial expressionsparallel
the wayyou're feeling whileyou're speaking.

274
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,220
I'm surprised this guywrites in cursive.

275
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,540
His message is so clear.
I would've thoughthe'd print everything.

276
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,080
Actually,his connectedwriting shows that he deals
with problemsin a practicaland direct manner.

277
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,850
- Like shooting someone.
- Exactly.

278
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,000
The hollow manuses simple statements, all first person.

279
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,970
For example,"I won't be ignored."

280
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,910
He's obviously tiredof feeling this way.

281
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:48,770
It's quite possible he'sgot a job in solitude
or one that he feelsstrips him of his identity.

282
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,620
His job might require himto wear a uniform,
something that showsabsolutely no individuality.

283
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,880
Or he may be overqualified for his menial job

284
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,770
and feels that he doesn't get
the respectthat he necessarilydeserves.

285
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,850
But todayhe's killed 2 women,
which tells ushe's growing confident.

286
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,060
This makes himunpredictable and dangerous.

287
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,920
And because he hasno physical
contactwith his victims,

288
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,760
it's going to make himthat
much harder to catch.

289
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,560
We have more informationon the mill creek killer

290
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,040
because he spendsa lot of timewith
his victimsbefore and afterhis kills.

291
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,380
Because his victimswillingly follow him
in broad daylight,he appears harmless.

292
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,190
- He's mostlikely handsome.
- Handsome?

293
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,900
Yes.These women wouldn't follow
an unattractive man.They just wouldn'T.

294
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,490
He's handsome,and he's got
the socialskills to trick his victims.

295
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,720
Those who know him well,they'd be shocked
to learn that he'sthe man that we're after.

296
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,160
He's been ableto get his victims
awayfrom family,friends.

297
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,080
Obviously,this makeshim feel powerful.

298
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,020
If this guy is so smart,why would he risk driving
his victimsfrom the abduction siteto the woods?

299
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,010
Because of the ritual.

300
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,270
It's become the mostimportant thing to him.

301
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,990
Dominates his thoughts.
Bullets providethe privacy he needs.

302
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,490
The hollow manis motivated
byexternal pressures.

303
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,210
This is a guy who simplywants attention.

304
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,800
The mill creek killer,on the other hand,
he's drivenby internal forces.

305
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,530
He's a sexuallymotivated offender.

306
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,960
Now,this makes hima lot more predictable

307
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,500
but don't think for a second
it makes himany easier to catch.

308
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,830
Where are you?

309
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,610
Excuse mE.

310
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,550
Meredith dale.
25.

311
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,320
She was supposedto meet her friend
for a bike ridebut disappeared.

312
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,870
- Disappeared when?
- An hour ago.

313
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,110
- How can we be sureit's him?
- Well,look at her.

314
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,610
She's his type physically,
she vanishes into thin air.

315
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,700
It's got the mill creek'sM.O.All over it.

316
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,420
I'll set up road blocks in and out of the forest.

317
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,200
Well,based onthe other timelines,
we have to assume he's hidingher body right now.

318
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,210
Best chanceof catching himis find
meredith dale's bodyand sit tight.

319
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,540
We know he'll be back.

320
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,580
I'm going to need you to step out of your vehicle.

321
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,620
- What's going onhere,officer?
- Just routine check.

322
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,650
- Can you open your back?
- Uh,yeah,sure.

323
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,100
Many people come throughhere today?

324
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,780
- What are youdoing up here?
- Went for a hike.

325
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,320
No water,no supplies?

326
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,030
My bootsare all I need.

327
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,190
That it?

328
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,290
- That's it.
- Ok.

329
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,650
What if these dumpsitesaren't random?

330
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,710
The bodies werescattered all over.

331
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,010
Look at this.
There's no pattern.

332
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,340
No,I see that,but we're talking
about a lotof area to cover here.

333
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,140
He had to havesome kind of
plan going into these woods.

334
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,620
Must have done his homework.

335
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,300
Ok.The first bodywas found
deep into the woods.

336
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,540
That's a 3-hour carride from the city.

337
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,300
The first time,he's more
carefulin disposing of her.

338
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,730
Her body was discovered by a
forest ranger5 daysafter the abduction.

339
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,910
And all the other victims--look at this¡ª
they followthe same pattern.

340
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,760
What are you saying?
You think he worksup there?

341
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,810
He might.

342
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,550
All I doknow for sureis that he has
to be familiar enoughwith these woods

343
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,170
to know when a rangeris on duty.

344
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,540
He knew preciselywhen and where
to drop the bodies.

345
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,660
Now that is an awesome
place to dump a person.

346
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,950
- Come on,garcia.
- What?I'm justsaying,angel fish.

347
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,500
A million acresconverts into
over 2,300square miles to cover.

348
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,060
Evil knewwhat he was doing.

349
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,870
Yeah?Well,now so do we.

350
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,430
Talk to me.
How's the rangerschedule break down?

351
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,890
Ok.The national forestis divided
into 6 ranger districts,

352
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,690
which are patrolledevery 3 to 5 days.

353
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,580
Now,the potosi-fredricktown area
must be where he'sheaded to next

354
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,580
because the rangers werejust there yesterday,

355
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,030
which means they're notscheduled
to revisit itfor at leastanother 3 days.

356
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,700
And look at that,
it's the district closest to the city.

357
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,920
Well,that makes sense.
He's in a hurry.

358
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,140
He wantsto get in and out of there
without a lot of trouble.

359
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,140
Which area has the easiest
access to the main road?

360
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,130
That would be...
saltgrass cove.

361
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,780
Saltgrass cove.

362
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,140
Yep.He'd have plentyof time to revisit her.

363
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,880
What?No,no.I don't want to know that.Bye-bye.

364
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,320
Think I know where he took meredith dale.

365
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,060
Brownie,come here.

366
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,410
Damn it.

367
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,840
Please,please.

368
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,730
Everything needsto look
the sameas when he left it.

369
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,790
- He'll come back.
- He needs to seemeredith again.

370
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,070
This bastard has killed
7 women on my watch.

371
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,810
- Comb the scene!
- Oh,no.Please,please!Stop!

372
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,430
Let's clearthe immediate area.

373
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,460
Post yourselvesalong the perimeter.
It's imperativethat you become invisible.

374
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,770
He set his own trap.

375
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,380
What we need to do now
is stake out in the woodsand hunt him,

376
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,290
just like he doeshis victims.

377
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,900
That's got to be him.

378
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,970
Fbi!Stay down!
Hands whereI can see them.

379
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,430
Ok,ok.
Just take it easy.

380
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,420
Jim meyers.
What the hell?

381
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,730
- You'rethe mill creek killer?
- What?No.

382
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,170
Then how the helldid you get here?

383
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,120
I got another letter from the hollow man.

384
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,130
Telling you exactly where to findmeredith dale?

385
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,490
I swear.
You can read it.

386
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,530
"Follow the cottonwood trail
throughsaltgrass cove."

387
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,390
Wait a minute.
We just figuredthis out ourselves.

388
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,550
How can another killerknow
the specificsabout someone else'sdumpsite?

389
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,580
What's going on?

390
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,820
It's going to beall over the news.

391
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,570
Looklikethe hollow man
didn't give youthe exclusive this time.

392
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,710
So our plan to catchthe mill creek killer
was ruinedby the hollow man?

393
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,400
And now the hollow man'son a high.

394
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,140
He hasn't pulledthe trigger
since he took2 victims yesterday.

395
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,560
Is he satisfied or
is he just getting started?

396
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,100
We'll find out.

397
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,880
"Hollow man helps fbifind
the mill creekkiller's victim."

398
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,150
Nice.He's alerted the media and injected
himselfinto the investigation.

399
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,990
He's getting the attentionhe's been craving.

400
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,280
But if the shooterreally wants
to getthe other guy arrested,

401
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,190
he would've called usand not the media.

402
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,030
He must knowthe mill creek killer
needsto revisit the body.

403
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,440
If he can't defilethe woman again,the need'll
become so strong,it could pushhim into a frenzy.

404
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,650
And if that happens,this guy is just
a time bombwaiting to explode.

405
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,310
Excuse me.

406
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,010
Hi.
Look,I'm having a day.

407
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,810
My car won't startand I forgot my phone.

408
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,860
Could I use yoursto make a call?

409
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,710
Yeah.
Ok.I know it's here.
I just used it.

410
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,520
What,you know what?
Forget the phone.

411
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,490
Maybe it'll start for you.

412
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,780
Walk with me.
It's rightaround the corner.

413
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,050
- No,that's ok.
- No,come on.

414
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,750
No.
No!

415
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,340
- Walk with me.
- Let go of me!

416
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,610
- Now!
- Let me go!

417
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,030
Help!
Help!

418
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,330
Somebody!
Somebody!Help,please!

419
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,070
Somebody!
Please!

420
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,260
- At first he seemedso normal.
- Was he handsome?

421
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,690
- Excuse me?
- Was he handsome?

422
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,600
Yeah.
He was.

423
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,130
Actually,that'swhy I stopped.

424
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,720
When didhis demeanor change?

425
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,630
After I refusedto go to his car.

426
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,780
He grabbedmy arm so hard
I thought thatit would break.

427
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,750
I've been watching the newsabout all these women
being abducted,and I just started screaming.

428
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,390
You trustedyour instincts.

429
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,720
Because of that,you're still alive.

430
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,470
Miss,there's a sketch artist here with us.

431
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,640
He can create a prettyaccurate rendition
from your descriptionof this man.

432
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,350
- Would you sit with him?
- Absolutely.

433
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,780
officer.

434
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,060
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

435
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,440
Well,he's becoming
irrational and violentin public.

436
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,330
That's exactlywhat the hollow man
wanted him to do.

437
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,840
Well,if he doesn'tfind a victim soon,
he'll becomemore dangerous.

438
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,450
How's that possible?

439
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,620
He'll dropthe ruse entirely and just
startgrabbing women at random.

440
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,620
Great.
Thanks,man.

441
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,590
The witness gota good look  
at themill creek killer.

442
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,540
You know,if it'sthe hollow man's
intentionto force himinto a frenzy,

443
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,260
he's getting what he wants.

444
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,540
He knew exactly where to
find meredith dale's body.

445
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,830
He figured out the route
to the dumpsitethe same way we did.

446
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,010
They always sayserial killers
makethe best profilers.

447
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,580
Yeah,butthis guy's dead-on.

448
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,900
Yeah.The headline doesn't
mention the shooter at all.

449
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,800
We talked to jim meyers,the reporter,
asked him not to respondto the letter,

450
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,310
he doesn't,and thenthe guy
goes out andshoots 2 more women.

451
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,320
- In a betterpart of town.
- What gives himthis confidence?

452
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,060
What's the significance
of the paper at the scene?

453
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,830
We know he wantsto be newsworthy.
He could've justtossed it aside.

454
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,210
Instead,he displayed it.

455
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,630
There's somethinghe wants us to look at.
There's definitelysomething in the paper.

456
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,340
I thinkI figured it out.

457
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,820
What is it?

458
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,190
They're talking.
In the classifieds.

459
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,370
classifieds,code names.
This feels likean old spy movie.

460
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,430
It's low-tech,simple,but very effective.

461
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,480
They've beendoing this for months,
and nobody ever knew it.

462
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,920
This is the first onethat I found.
The references arewhat made me suspicious.

463
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,580
"Sunny,are you an artist too?

464
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,040
I'd love to see your work
sometime.Holden."

465
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,360
Sunny?
Holden?

466
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,700
They're charactersfrom catcher in the rye.

467
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,960
Widely acceptedas a loved bookof sociopaths.

468
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,240
Mark david chapman quoted it
after killing john lennon.

469
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,790
Deranged minds identifywith
holden's alienationand detachment.

470
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,290
I found the initial contact.
It ran in the paperunchanged for months.

471
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:47,280
"We have differenttastes,
but I can appreciate your art.Sunny."

472
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,730
Sunny's the hollow man.
He initiated contact.

473
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,350
- What's he gettingout of it?
- A mentor.

474
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,920
Offered admirationand respect.

475
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,020
In return,he gains 
encouragementand confidence.

476
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,160
But when the hollow manremained
unnoticedby the press,

477
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,560
he resented his mentor and
turned itinto a rivalry.

478
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,330
Hollow man became jealous.

479
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,950
They were both killers,but they weren't
seen in the same playing field.

480
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,300
What else did you find?

481
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,340
"An overwhelming area and you never get lost?"

482
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,140
Then the answerto this question.

483
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,300
"I do my research."
It's not so randomwhen you know the area.

484
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,790
I like cotton woodin sgc."

485
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,570
Sgc?He's talking aboutsaltgrass cove.

486
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,980
- He told him howto find meredith dale.
- Why?

487
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,320
Teaching his studenta lesson.

488
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,230
We understandtheir relationship.

489
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,090
Let's use itagainst them.

490
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,880
Hey,sweetness.Make me smile
and tell meyou got a name.

491
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,770
Oh,I got scadsof them,babe,
but none paid for thesepersonal ads.

492
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,620
They went with cash, totally old school.

493
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,790
I hate itwhen they're smart.
2 separate accountsin good standing.

494
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,990
Well,these guysare good.
Thanks.

495
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,560
Garcia saysthey coveredtheir tracks.
How's it goingin here?

496
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,150
Reid's imitatingthe hollow man'slanguage patterns
to send a messageto the mill creek killer.

497
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,310
He's offering condolenceson
losing meredith dale.

498
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,540
Well,if he can'tget to meredith dale,
he's gonna needa body.

499
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,520
He's gonnaneed it real soon.

500
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,660
You guys worriedthat the hollow
man's going to ruinour plan again?

501
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,420
He wants the mill creek killer to get caught.

502
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,780
The pupil's tryingto kill the teacher?

503
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,630
Hope you're close,reid.

504
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,780
You got less than an hour 
to meet the deadline.

505
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,580
You'll be surrounded.

506
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,330
Need you to relax...
as best you can.

507
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,780
This guy's going to wantto get close to you,
and he's goingto want to examine you.

508
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,110
He's going to wantto touch me?

509
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,360
Since you're a gift,not a marked victim,
he might tryto make you his own.

510
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,770
But we're not going to 
let him get that far.

511
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,850
We need him to getclose
to confirmhe's the killer.

512
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,750
There's nothing normal
about this guy.Nothing.

513
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,150
You have any questions?

514
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,320
Let's do this.

515
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,400
Ok.
Down you go.

516
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,470
Close your eyes. Try to relax.

517
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,450
What do you think?
Did it sound likethe hollow man?

518
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,920
Hopefully the mill 
creekkiller will buy it.

519
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:30,190
"Dear holden,they say imitation"
is the highest formof flattery.

520
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,980
"Since you were almostin harm's way,
"I thought I'd sharesome art.

521
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,550
Should make youfeel better.
here's my gift to you.sunny.

522
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,820
Hello.

523
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,400
Fbi!
Get down!Stay down!

524
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,970
One down,one to go.

525
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,740
Stop right here.

526
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,710
It's going to betough to
pushthrough this crowd.

527
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,370
That's the idea.

528
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,900
I'm getting out.
Securea path to the door.

529
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,250
Everyone,take a step back.
Get back!

530
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,190
What do you have to sayto the families
of the women you killed?

531
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,270
Do you have any remorse
for what you've done?

532
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,670
- You're going to hell.
- You deserve to die!

533
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,840
I've alertedall news outletsthat
we'll be holdinga press conferencein 10 minutes.

534
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,550
- And you havethe script?
- Right here.

535
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,120
Be sure to sayexactly those words.

536
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,120
- The wording'simportant,jj.
- Relax.

537
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,420
It's notmy first party,boys.

538
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,170
Gideon,we don't havemuch on mill creek,
especially if he sayshe stumbled on the body.

539
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,980
So what arewe going to do?

540
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,190
I'll go tryand do my job.

541
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,070
Ok.
Thanks.

542
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,870
You comfortable?

543
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,490
As comfortable as 
anyonecan be in handcuffs.

544
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,670
Let me see.

545
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,430
I'm jason gideon.

546
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,660
You know,I don'tknow
your name or where you're from...

547
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,820
the only thingwe do knowis
you'rean intelligent,good-looking man

548
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,450
with an inflated ego who happens
to likekilling women.

549
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:56,610
Well,you had metill that last part...
agent gideon.

550
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,960
Imagine how shockedI am,
considering I haven'tdone anything.

551
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,410
I see a woman whoI think is
in distressin the woodsand I get...

552
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,580
pounced on.

553
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:15,020
Fbi wantsto interview you.
Talk about your work.

554
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,650
We never believed we'dhave you in custody.

555
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,860
I mean,definitelythought the hollow
man would be easierto catch.

556
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,910
Is that upsetting?

557
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,930
I thought the twoof you were friends,
that you admired eachother's work and...

558
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,030
I don't knowthe hollow man.

559
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,700
But if I did,I'd say he sounds like an obsessed fan.

560
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,760
Is that howyou see yourself, as somebody famous?

561
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,460
Well,from what I've read about the mill
creek killer,I'd say he's an artist.

562
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,310
Fascination wasn'tcompletely one-sided.

563
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,340
You did respondto his ads in the paper.

564
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,400
No one can respectwhat
the hollow man has done.

565
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,720
He's got no imagination.

566
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,090
But he's smart.

567
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:03,460
Foundmeredith dale's body,
even toldthe media about it.

568
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,870
Whoever taught him, taught him very well.

569
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,450
That's very true.

570
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,970
It just soundslike the student
turnson the teacher.

571
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,910
No,no.
He wasprotecting him.

572
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,220
Is that what you think
the hollow manwas doing?

573
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,840
Well,what elsecould it be?

574
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,050
Manipulating you,
gaining your trust.

575
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,610
When he got it,
the hollow manset you up.

576
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,730
You werefront page newS.
Now you'd be a footnote.

577
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,390
Hollow man's out there,you're in here.
It's all because of him.

578
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,170
Is that what you want?

579
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,850
You want meto get angry
to help you catch him?

580
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,620
That is notyour problem,sir.

581
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,040
Then what do you want?

582
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,290
I have just have one question.

583
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:51,010
If killing those womenmade you an artist,
the thingsyou did to them afterthey were dead...

584
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,940
what does that make you?

585
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,030
I mean,really it...

586
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,700
it just doesn't seemvery artistic,does it?

587
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,790
You went back,you fix their make-up,
you'd comb their hair.

588
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,750
And you visited them...

589
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,810
- over and over and over.
- I didn't do that.

590
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,660
If you thoughtyou were famous before,
wait until the pressgets a hold of you--

591
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,480
- you shut your mouth.
- Details of your visit.

592
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,820
Shut your mouth.
I never went back.

593
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,930
You expect meto believe that
you onlykilled those women?

594
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,820
That it wasn'tyou who kept
visitingthe corpses?

595
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,250
We foundlipstick in your hand
when we caught you.

596
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,130
- You will nottell anyone that.
- Excuse me?

597
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,960
I said you cannever say that.

598
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,410
- You didn't visitthe corpses?
- No.

599
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,760
- No,you justkilled them.
- Yes.

600
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,480
Yes.
I killed them.

601
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:40,110
But...but you can'ttell anyone...
that I went back.

602
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,630
You can't do that.

603
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,270
The women of st.Louiscan rest easy tonight...

604
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,960
after a long year,the mill
creek killeris in custody.

605
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,040
This manis highly intelligent
and he usesa sophisticated rouse

606
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,400
when luring these womenin public places.

607
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,370
The mill creek killeris someone
the bauwill want to study

608
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,040
as one of the mostcomplex criminals
we've dealt with in years.

609
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,210
- Questions?
- Yes?

610
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,720
What's the fbi doingabout
the other serial killer?

611
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,420
We have new information
about that case.

612
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,420
We no longerbelieve
the shootingsare related.

613
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,440
- Yes?
- What's the new information?

614
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,310
We believe they areisolated incidents,

615
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,500
and we're lookinginto the possibility
that the last 2were copycats.

616
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,490
Jim meyers?

617
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,900
Are you referringto the killer
who callshimself the hollow man?

618
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,680
We believe the personwho wrote
that letteris nothingbut a street thug.

619
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,430
We have evidencethat indicates
that the letterwas just a prank

620
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,430
to throw us offthe investigation
of the mill creek killer.

621
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,810
This is no longera bau case.

622
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:43,790
It lacks a certainsophistication,class,
there'sjust nothing elegantabout it.

623
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,810
That's all the questions
we'll take for now.Thank you.

624
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,410
Well,we set the bait,
we'll seeif he takes it.

625
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,330
Place your coins,keys,
belts in the basket.

626
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,390
Walk this way.

627
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,750
Walk this way.

628
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,740
Stepto the side,please.

629
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,430
Extend your arms.

630
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,790
Stay down.

631
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,300
give your weaponright now.

632
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,590
Get up.

633
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,300
Where is he?
I wantto see him right now.

634
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,830
You tell himthe hollow man's here.

635
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,690
He told youto say those
things about me,didn't he?

636
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,110
He told youto use those words.

637
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,290
Get him out of here.

638
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,220
I'm no lesselegant than he is.

639
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,620
- I'm no copycat.
- Shut your mouth.

640
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,830
I left youthe newspaper!
I gave youthe mill creek killer!

641
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,980
What elsedo I have to do?

642
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,910
Go!
Get him out of here!

643
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,210
This is the storyfor tomorrow.

644
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,780
"they were our daughters,
sisters,brothers,and friends."

645
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:15,850
they have every rightto be remembered...
and memorialized.

646
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,410
*There are nonewho live downtown...*

647
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,240
they didn't mentionthe shooter.

648
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:34,670
He was a nobody whowanted to be somebody
by killing people andthey didn't give him that.

649
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,930
Good.

650
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:44,030
Mahatma gandhi once said,"remember that allthrough
historythere have been tyrants and murderers

651
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,960
and for a timethey seem invincible..."

652
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,600
*like ancient bruises...*

653
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,010
"but in the end,they always fall.
Always."

654
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,620
*I'm awake to feel...*

655
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,350
please tell meyou haven't been
there for the last 4 days.

656
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,720
I heard you wereflying back tonight.

657
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,990
Heard?How couldyou
have heard a thing like that?

658
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,050
This was dropped offtoday.

659
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,300
I appreciateyour interest,agent,
but profilingis a specialty.

660
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,930
We can't just letanyone
who wants togive it a whirl.

661
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,800
The I-80 killer?
Co-eds in indiana?

662
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,510
Yes,I read iton the plane.

663
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,610
They aren'tblitz attacks.
This guy's organized.

664
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,850
He's a white male,early 30s,
and a smooth talker,

665
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,110
because evenafter 11 victims,
he can still convince

666
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,910
educated women who know there's
a predator out thereto get into his car.

667
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,450
How would youadvise the police?

668
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,740
I would stake outthe ranch house,
a night club in gary.

669
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,490
They have a very popular
ladies night on thursdays.

670
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,680
If you look closely,you'll see that 8 outof
the 11 victimswent missingon a friday morning.

671
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,290
So something gets this creep's
motor runningon thursdays.

672
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,400
This isn't a whirl,agent hotchner.

673
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,530
I don't know how thepaperwork
got screwed up

674
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:02,150
or maybe youbelieve my parents pulled
some strings,which they didn't,by the way.

675
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,140
I belong in this unit.

676
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,550
And all I'masking you for
is the chanceto show you that.

677
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,570
I still needto look into this.
I'm notpromising anything.

678
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,220
Understood.

679
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,250
We brief new cases
every morning at 10:00 am.

680
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,340
You can see facilities
management about a desk.

681
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,700
You won't be sorry.
