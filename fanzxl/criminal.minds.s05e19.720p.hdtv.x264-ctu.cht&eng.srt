1
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,080
別 求你了

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,680
別 求你了

3
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,620
別 求你了

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,590
等下 別!

5
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,160
等等 不要!

6
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,060
- 嘿 Hotch在哪?  - 在開預算會議 
- Hey,where's hotch? - Budget meeting.

7
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,420
也許他會給我們爭取到預算增加
Maybe he'll get us a raise.

8
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,450
上頭巴不得減預算呢 怎麼會加錢 只希望別省了咖啡錢
They're cutting, not raising. I just hope they don't take the coffee.

9
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,840
- 那我不幹了 - 行啊 你不幹 每周省50塊給我
- I'd quit. - Oh,yeah. That'll save 'em like 50 bucks a week.

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,250
- 他會在飛機上跟我們碰頭  - 我們去哪? 
- He'll meet us on the plane. - Where are we going?

11
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,560
昨晚 警長辦公室門口  發現3個被斬首的人頭
Last night, 3 decapitated heads were found in front of a sheriff's station

12
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,300
在德克薩斯州的一個邊陲小鎮Terlingua
in the small border town of terlingua,texas.

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,860
一次發現三個受害人?
3 victims at once?

14
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,480
其實 三人的屍首腐爛程度不同
Actually,they appear to be in different stages of decomposition.

15
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,900
驗屍證實 其中一個人頭剛被砍下一天左右
M.e.confirmed that one of the heads is a day or so old.

16
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,390
其他兩人似乎死於幾個月前 
The other 2 appear to have died a few months ago,

17
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,280
但傷口砍痕顯示他們是最近被斬首 
But the wound edges suggest that they were decapitated recently.

18
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,240
口 耳 鼻均有泥土
Dirt in their mouth, ears,and nose.

19
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,890
- 表明這兩個頭被埋過 - 然後又被挖出來
- At some point, these two heads were buried. - And then dug up.

20
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,200
好的 那為何又突然挖出他們? 
Ok,so why the sudden need to display them?

21
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,060
可能並不是突然需要挖出
The need may not be so sudden.

22
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,330
墨西哥 僅2009年一年 就發現10個被斬首的人頭
Mexico,in 2009 alone, 10 heads in coolers,

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,380
而這些人頭所屬的受害者 都是發現前幾小時才被殺
And the people belonging to these heads we're killed just hours before they were found.

24
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,720
販毒集團幫派爭鬥的結果 
Result of a battle between feuding drug cartels.

25
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,070
DEA(違禁藥品緝查局)不感興趣嗎?
Dea's not interested?

26
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,380
他們說讓我們先看看
They asked us to take a look at it.

27
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,970
考慮到屍首腐爛程度不同 說可能無關毒品
Considering the different decomposition, this might not even be about drugs.

28
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,780
我們有什麼線索? 
Then what do we have?

29
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,630
受害者是兩名男性 一名女性  所以沒有性別偏好
Well,the victims are two males,one female, so no gender preference.

30
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,670
在警長辦公室門口拋下斬首的頭顱 這是侵略性的表示
Staging the heads in front of a sheriff's station-- that's aggressive.

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,400
- 3名受害者均為拉美裔  - 身份不明
- All 3 victims are hispanic. - And unidentified.

32
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,330
Terlingua的非法"盲流"很多
Terlingua has a large illegal population.

33
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,680
取證這些受害者的身份非常困難 
It's made i.d.ing the victims that much harder.

34
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,790
兇手可能試圖發出某種類型的政治聲明 
He might be trying to make some type of political statement.

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,690
那堛疑銋狳腋犑蚅@者 分擔了警察很多工作
Volunteer border patrols do a lot of personal policing down there.

36
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,480
民兵等團體認為維持治安高於一切 
Groups like the minutemen prize law and order above everything else.

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,480
這些巡邏是他們的政治議程 
And those patrols serve their political agenda.

38
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,750
謀殺會破壞他們的形象 
Murder would be bad for their image.

39
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,690
拋屍首在警站門口 表明不明嫌犯很可能是當地人 
Staging the heads in front of a police station suggests that the unsub might be local.

40
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,470
他必須掌握詳細的情況 才能不被人看見 
He'd have to have a knowledge about how to do something like that without being seen.

41
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,650
我們要面對的是 數百英里未列入轄區的沙漠
So what we have is hundreds of miles of unincorporated desert

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,200
以及龐大的每天偷越境的偷渡群
And an endless supply of anonymous victims crossing the border every day.

43
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,790
這是連環殺手的完美殺戮風暴 
It's a serial killer's perfect storm.

"只有飢餓的時候 獅子才會出動捕獵"
"a lion's work hours are only when he's hungry.

46
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,820
"一旦飽腹 捕食者與獵物也就和平共處"
"once he's satisfied, the predator and prey live peacefully together."

47

Chuck Jones (美國動畫大師 編劇 製片人)
Chuck jones.

48
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,800
給我解釋一下這個 
Explain this to me.

49
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,280
不明嫌犯在美墨邊境地區找尋目標
The unsub hunts along the u.s.-mexico border.

50
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,800
這地有多大?
How big is that area?

51
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,180
5000多平方英里的沙漠 
Over 5,000 square miles of desert.

52
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,610
他很可能行兇多年一直未被發現 
He could have gone undetected for years.

53
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,180
- 為什麼現在要暴露自己?  - 最近一定發生了什麼事
- So why announce himself? - Something happened recently.

54
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,590
關於Terlingua的犯罪情況 我們知道些什麼? 
What do we know about crime in terlingua?

55
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,220
這是一個暫居城鎮 
It's a stop-over town.

56
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,820
移民入境會在此停留24小時 然後再進入美國 
Immigrants stay only 24 hours before moving on,

57
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,660
但這也使該鎮成為販毒中心
but that also makes them narco-trafficking hubs.

58
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,640
除了違反移民法之外 大部分是跟毒品有關的逮捕案 
Outside of immigration violations, most of the arrests are drug related.

59
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,840
美人兒 你可是輕描淡寫了
That,my pretties, in an understatement.

60
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,780
有人熟悉下加州的Lugo販毒集團嗎? (下加州: 墨西哥最北最西的州)
Anyone familiar with the lugo cartel out of baja california?

61
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,930
他們跟兩大罪惡脫不了干係 (hit也有毒品計量的意思)
Their greatest hits-- the pun being inescapable--

62
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,610
1990-2009間 犯下多起殘忍謀殺 以及進口分銷
Include multiple brutal murders along with importing and distributing nearly 2 tons of cocaine

63
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,570
近2噸的可卡因 和大量海洛因
And copious amounts of heroin between 1990 and 2009.

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,110
弱我們登上BAU的"時間機器"來到當下 便會發現一種超級便宜 更容易上癮 
Now,if we get in our bau time machine, flash forward to now, a super cheap, highly addictive,

65
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,500
從黑焦油海洛因提煉出的不純毒品 剛在Terlingua的大街小巷上市
And totally impure form of black tar heroin just showed up on the streets of terlingua,

66
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,780
而DEA認為 Lugo販毒集團應為此事負責
And the dea thinks the lugo cartel is directly responsible.

67
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,810
他們正在拓展他們的生意 
So they're expanding their operation.

68
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,230
而這往往會掀起腥風血浪 
Which is often announced by a wave of violence.

69
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,820
Lugo集團去年殺了兩個DEA的探員 
The lugo cartel killed 2 dea agents last year.

70
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,730
我們必須加倍小心
We're going to need to watch our backs.

71
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,870
對於販毒集團 FBI是他們的死對頭 甚至還會設立獎賞 所以...
To cartels, feds are fair game. There's even usually a bounty,so...

72
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,970
我們得隨身帶著這些大"玩具"
We're going to bring in the toys.

73
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,580
小心 我可不想在預算上增加 維修MP5槍的費用
Be careful with those. I don't need broken mp-5s on our budget.

74
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,450
各位 問個問題
Guys,here's the thing.

75
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,420
我好像沒被授權 攜帶此類武器
I don't think i technically have authorization to carry a weapon like that.

76
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,480
- 你沒有 - 你沒有
- You don't. - You don't.

77
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,870
我們這次面對的受害者群體 都不會情願和我們交談
You know,we're going to have a victim pool that is extremely hesitant to talk to us.

78
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Prentiss 你和Morgan從移民社區入手 看能造成多大反響
Prentiss,you and morgan start with the migrant community, see what inroads you can make.

79
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,000
強調我們只是為了找出兇手
Stress that we're only there to catch a killer.

80
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,150
Rossi和Reid 驗屍官等著帶你們去看頭顱
Rossi and reid, the m.e.is waiting to show you the heads.

81
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,620
也許它們能給我們透點線索
Maybe they can tell us something.

82
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,190
<i>德州 Terlingua</i>

83
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,330
怎麼回事?
What's this about?

84
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,130
這是Lugo集團的一部分
This is part of the lugo cartel.

85
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,820
借過
Excuse us.

86
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,140
聯邦探員 請讓開
Federal agents. Step aside.

87
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,120
我們是這個國家的合法公民 在行使 憲法第一修正案賦予的和平集會的權利
We're legal citizens of this country demonstrating our first amendment rights to a peaceful assembly,

88
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,880
來抗議當局非法逮捕Omar Morales
In order to protest the unlawful arrest of omar morales.

89
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,860
請繞道而行
You walk around us.

90
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,320
警探們 Ruiz警長在堶惜[候  忽略這幫人
Agents,sheriff ruiz is waiting inside. Ignore them.

91
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,960
別幹傻事 警察同學
Don't do nothin' stupid,deputies.

92
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,580
你啥時候想動手 Jose  你知道去哪塈銣畯
Anytime you want to make a move,jose, you know where to find us.

93
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,390
你們都知道
All y'all do.

94
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,570
很抱歉 門口的"迎賓小組"
Sorry about the welcoming committee.

95
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,600
還以為你們半小時後才到
We didn't expect you for another half hour.

96
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,310
有多少 呃 警局埵@有幾個警察?
How many,uh, how many officers in the whole department?

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,410
包括警長的話 5個
Including the sheriff,5.

98
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,030
門口有8個大漢
There are 8 men outside.

99
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,230
這就是他們的目的 對吧? 拿人數來唬你們
And that's the point,right? To show that they outnumber you.

100
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,740
是啊 如果按人頭算 我們毫無勝券
Well,if it came down to numbers, we wouldn't stand a chance.

101
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,070
那些個混混只是為Omar Morales 賣命的士兵的零頭
Those scumbags are only a handful of the soldiers who work for omar morales.

102
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,100
他是當地毒品交易的樞紐點
He's the head of a local narco traffic ring.

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
我們今早在鎮外把他逮捕的
We picked him up this morning just outside of town.

104
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,860
他正往飛機場去
He was headed for the airport.

105
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,940
他錄口供了嗎?
Has he made a statement?

106
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,020
- 不好說 - 什麼意思?
- Not exactly. - Meaning?

107
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,670
Ruiz警長不讓我們進去問話
Sheriff ruiz won't let us talk to him.

108
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,010
- 為什麼? - 也許你該親自問問她
- And why is that? - Well,maybe you can ask her why.

109
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,710
這邊請
Right this way.

110
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,180

- Can i get you anything? Coffee? - No,thank you.

114
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,270
長官 你打算怎麼對付外面的小軍隊?
Ma'am,how do you plan on dealing with the small army outside?

115
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,880
我計劃忽略他們
I plan on ignoring them.

116
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,730
- 我們可以... - 他們會站得又熱又累 然後自己走掉
- Well,we can have some of-- - they'll get hot and tired and go away on their own.

117
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,540
我並不擔心他們
They're the least of my worries.

118
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,580
- 聽說你抓了個人 - 我的手下抓的
- We heard you made an arrest. - My deputies did.

119
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,770
- 你不贊成? - 因為他們做錯了
- But you don't agree? - Because they're wrong.

120
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,180
把頭顱擺在你局門口的人  想給你傳條信息
Whoever staged these heads in front of your office is trying to tell you something.

121
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,280
- 他們想讓我收手 - 收手什麼?
- They want me to butt out. - Of what,exactly?

122
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,000
我數過 我做警長的半年來 有超過20個移民失蹤
I count more than 20 missing immigrants just in the 6 months i've been sheriff.

123
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,030
- 每月不止3個 - 幾乎每周一個
- That's more than 3 in a month. - Almost one victim a week.

124
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,740
這堨u有名字和粗略的介紹 有其他書面材料嗎?
These are just names and cursory descriptions. Is there any other paperwork?

125
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,770
有進行調查嗎?
Has there been any investigation?

126
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,900
沒人會來報案
No one will make an official report,

127
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,100
但我相信 這邊有人長時間行兇
But i believe somebody around here has been killing for a long time.

128
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,610
想笑嗎? 我離開北布魯克林 那邊的兇殺案開始減少
Want a laugh? I left brooklyn north homicide to slow down.

129
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,670
我為自己的半退休選錯了地點
I picked the wrong part of the country to semi-retire.

130
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,860
這地方亂了套
This place is swimming in dysfunction.

131
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,520
壓根是倖存者遊戲 沒人可信
It's a game of survival, and i can't trust anyone.

132
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,860
長官 你有4名警員
Ma'am,you've got 4 deputies.

133
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,160
我清楚地告訴他們 不要惹Omar Morales
Who i expressly told to leave omar morales alone.

134
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,190
看他們是怎麼執行我的命令的
You can see how well they follow orders.

135
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,320
你確定不是Lugo集團所為?
Then you're sure this isn't the lugo cartel?

136
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,370
用謀殺來傳口信  正是這些人交流的風格
Murder to send a message is the way these guys communicate.

137
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,600
跟我來
Come with me.

138
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,760
知道嗎 和普遍觀念相反 斬首並不輕鬆
You know,contrary to popular belief, decapitation is not that easy.

139
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,320
普遍和斬首在同一句子 還真不常見
You don't often hear popular and decapitation in the same sentence.

140
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,280
必須從脊柱最薄弱的地方下手
You need to strike on the weakest point of the spine.

141
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,120
通常在C3和C7脊椎骨之間
It's normally between the c3 and c7 vertebrae.

142
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,410
這埵釵h處落刀點 但每刀都砍得利落
There are multiple strikes, but they don't show any hesitation.

143
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,360
我知道你沒啥好解剖的  但除了表面現象外
I realize you didn't have much to work with here, but outside of the obvious,

144
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,230
受害者們有什麼不尋常之處嗎?
Was there anything unusual about these victims?

145
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,820
第二名受害者好像是盲人 如果不全瞎的話
Well,the second victim appeared to have been blind, if not completely,

146
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,440
也有嚴重的白內障 行動都有困難
Then he had cataracts bad enough that it was difficult for him to get around.

147
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,970
- 另外2人呢? - 沒這情況
- What about the other two? - No.

148
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,700
最近一位受害者相對年長 第一位女性受害者也較年長
The most recent victim is older. So is the first one, the woman.

149
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,870
我只有牙齒能做比對
Well,i only had their teeth to go by,

150
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,580
需要點時間才能算出準確年齡 但 是的 我同意 他們相對年長
So it would take some time to get an accurate age, but,yeah,i'd agree. They were older.

151
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,430
我們要找的是 所謂的個性簽名
We're looking for something that we call a signature.

152
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,110
所有受害者共有的特性 身體上的記號 死後才顯現的
Something that all the victims shared, some physical mark, something postmortem.

153
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,470
不知道這是不是你們要找的
Well,i don't know if this is what you mean,

154
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,880
他們的鼻子和喉嚨堻ㄕ釣F子殘渣
But they all had sand residue in their noses and throats.

155
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,180
- 會不會是掩埋的時候留下的? - 有可能
- Could that be from being buried? - Possibly.

156
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,970
但是氣管和鼻腔 有撕裂痕跡
But the trachea and the nasal passage, they were kind of torn up.

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,820
如果能看到他們的肺 我猜堶惜]滿是沙子
If i had the lungs here, i'd guess that they were full of sand as well.

158
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,040
像是在沙子堜I吸?
You mean like they breathed in sand?

159
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,060
呼吸猛烈到撕裂他們的腔管
Forcefully enough that it lacerated the passages.

160
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,060
他們在奔跑
They were running.

161
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,250
這位是FBI的Hotchner探員
This is agent hotchner from the fbi.

162
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,700
體面的西裝
Nice suit.

163
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,860
知道那傢伙帶來了多少痛苦嗎?
You know how much misery that guy is responsible for?

164
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,670
我是聽說過販毒集團的殘忍勾當
Yeah,i've heard some of the things this cartel's capable of.

165
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,370
你上司要跟他談?
Your boss gonna talk to him?

166
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,560
他會試試看
He's gonna try.

167
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,390
祝他好運
Good luck.

168
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,410
這要傳達什麼信息?
What kind of message is this?

169
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,090
可笑嗎?
It's funny?

170
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,630
有點
Kind of,yeah.

171
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,370
如果發現有競爭對手了 你們就下此毒手嗎?
A competitor moves in on your business, is that what you would do?

172
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,270
- 假設? - 是的
- Hypothetically? - Yeah.

173
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,540
我會把他開膛破肚 把內臟留給動物享用
I'd gut him from crotch to chin, then leave his intestines open for the animals,

174
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,130
把他的左手寄給他老婆 眼睛寄給他媽
After i sent his left hand to his wife, his eyes to his mother,

175
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,970
給他孩子寄舌頭 再留張紙條 說爸爸死的時候嚇得尿褲子了
And his tongue to his kids, with a note saying that their papa had died wetting himself.

176
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,980
是個懦夫
A coward.

177
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,290
就算假設來說 這個也不叫信息
This,this ain't no message. Hypothetically.

178
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,340
這個辯解很有趣 說你下手會更狠
That's an interesting defense, saying that you would do worse.

179
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,090
辯解? 是你問了我問題
A defense? You asked me a question.

180
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,260
要是覺得我需要辯解 那就起訴我
You think i need a defense, charge me with something.

181
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,650
昨晚留在警局門外的那些頭 你怎麼看?
What do you know about the heads that were left outside the sheriff's station last night?

182
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,850
- 說真的? - 你是個喜歡掌控一切的男人
- Seriously? - You're a man who likes to be in control.

183
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,680
你還有個小型的軍隊在外面站崗
You have a small army standing guard outside.

184
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,220
他們保護你 因為你讓他們相信 他們需要你
They protect you because you've convinced them somehow that they need you,

185
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,780
你卻不明白 你的鎮上出了什麼事?
And you don't know what's going on in your town?

186
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,550
- 你沒告訴他? - 告訴我什麼?
- You didn't tell him? - Tell me what?

187
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,040
你要找的是Santa Muerte
You're looking for santa muerte.

188
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,060
死亡之神
The saint of death.

189
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,570
警長 Omar說的是什麼意思?
Sheriff,what exactly is omar talking about?

190
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,890
任何職業都有自己的保護神
Every job has a patron saint.

191
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,690
警察的是聖猶大 醫生的是大天使拉斐爾
Cops have saint jude, doctors have raphael the archangel.

192
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,940
但要是你是毒販子或者殺手  你會向誰祈禱?
But if you're a drug dealer or a killer, who do you pray to?

193
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,940
死亡之神
The saint of death.

194
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,520
我聽說 要是你 在穿越沙漠到這的路上走失 你就會死 
I've learned that crossing the desert to get here, you lose track of the ways you can die.

195
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,180
如果你有親近的人沒有挺過去 怪罪迷信有時候反而會好過些
So if someone close doesn't make it, sometimes it's easier to blame a superstitious figure.

196
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,130
Omar看起來不相信他說的那些
Well,omar doesn't seem like he believes what he's saying.

197
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,630
我沒說他信
I didn't say he believes it.

198
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,990
- 我說的是人們怪罪的那個 - 什麼人?
- I said it's who people are blaming. - What people?

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,540
聽著 Santa Muerte出現的越來越頻繁
Look,santa muerte has been coming up more and more.

200
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,690
我遣送回去的非法人員 逮捕的蛇頭
The illegals i send back. The coyotes i arrest.

201
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,700
還有些毒品販子 他們很害怕
Some of the drug traffickers, they're afraid.

202
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,960
害怕這個神?
Afraid of a saint?

203
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,220
我曾經手過一件謀殺案 唯一的證人是一個4歲的女孩子
I handled a homicide once where my only witness was this 4-year-old girl.

204
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,990
她告訴我 她父母是被一條龍殺死的
And she told me her mom and dad got killed by a dragon.

205
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,410
結果是那個兇手穿件綠色的雨衣 戴了只尖頭的帽子
Turns out the bad guy wore a green rain suit with a pointy hood.

206
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,850
在孩子看來 就像條龍
To the kid it looked like a dragon.

207
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
所以 要是有很多人都在談論同一個怪物
So when hundreds of people are talking about the same monster,

208
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,790
那麼一定是有事發生了
It's a sure bet something's going on.

209
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,660
他們只是不知道要怎麼稱呼它
They just don't know what to call it.

210
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,830
所以 他們叫他Santa Muerte
So they call it santa muerte.

211
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,040
快點

212
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,550
我只能送到這了 

213
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,490
沿著這兒爬過去

214
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,940
我只能送到這了 

215
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,990
我要休息會

216
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,230
一會就跟上來

217
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,870
我早說我們不該放走那個混蛋的
I told you we should have kept that bastard locked up.

218
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,520
我最後再說一次 Boyd 回去巡邏
And i'm telling you for the last time,boyd, go back on patrol.

219
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,120
沒有腐爛 這個受害人剛剛遇害
No decomposition. It's a new victim.

220
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,960
他的矛頭更集中在你身上了 警長
He's becoming more focused on you,sheriff.

221
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,900
警長 能單獨跟你說句嗎?
Sheriff,may i have a word with you?

222
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,900
很明顯 這是私人恩怨
It's clear that this is personal.

223
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,580
- 一直就是的 - 怎麼說?
- It always was. - How's that?

224
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,640
我不知道這幾年有多少這樣的人失蹤了
Look,i have no idea how many of these people have gone missing over the years,

225
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,970
但有一件事很清楚 我是唯一一個在乎的人
but one thing is clear.I'm the only one who seems to give a damn.

226
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,520
所以 這事的矛頭會向著我
That's as personal as it gets for me.

227
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,810
我們就是因為在乎才會站在這
We're here because we care.

228
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,490
我能收集到的 就只有大把的故事和迷信
Well... All i've got is a bunch of stories and superstitions.

229
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,260
要是根本就沒有這麼回事呢?
What if it isn't even happening?

230
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,310
警長 我不知道這已經持續了多久
Sheriff,i can't tell you how long this has been going on,

231
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,810
但現在絕對有事發生了
But something's definitely happening now.

232
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,800
而且從不明疑犯的行為來看 很明顯你觸動到他了
And from the way the unsub is acting, it's obvious that you've touched a nerve.

233
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,480
不管他是誰 我相信你有可能和他談過
Whoever he is,i think you've probably talked to him.

234
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,190
只要有人願意聽 我都會說
I've talked to anyone who will listen.

235
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,590
毒販子 移民 生意人
Drug dealers,immigrants, business owners--

236
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,960
Santa Muerte就是他們中的一個 他感覺到了壓力
Well,one of them is your santa muerte, and he's feeling the pressure.

237
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,690
等我們回到警局  我想查看每一個你做過的詢問
When we get back to the station, i want to go over every single interview you've done.

238
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,150
怎麼做? 我們要找的是誰?
How? Who are we even looking for?

239
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,000
我們有側寫給你和你的警員們
We have a profile to give you and your deputies.

240
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,130
我們要找的人格類型叫做人類捕手
We're searching for a personality type called a human predator--

241
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,320
用傳統的話說就是 獵手
In the classic sense, a hunter.

242
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,350
所有能明確指向他的受害人 都是相對年長 或有某種殘疾
All the victims we've been able to conclusively tie to him have been older or handicapped in some way.

243
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,080
這就說明他會等有人脫離隊伍 尋找最弱勢的一個
This suggests he waits for someone to separate from the pack, looks for the weakest.

244
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,350
像獅子之類的
Like a lion or something.

245
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,150
只是獅子是狩獵食物 這類獵手 獵的是力量
Except a lion hunts food. This type of predator hunts power.

246
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,160
這不是為了滿足需求 所有一切都是為了一個目的
It's not about serving a need, and everything is a means to that end.

247
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,540
我們還認為他是為了削弱受害人的力量 才會迫使他們穿越沙漠
We also believe that he makes his victims run through the desert in order to weaken them.

248
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,120
雖然受害者年長或有殘疾 他也可能 無法在他們最強的狀態下擊倒他們
He may not be capable of taking them on in their strongest state, despite their age or infirmity.

249
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,050
這意味著他有可能在某方面有殘障
This suggests that he's possibly handicapped in some way himself.

250
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,840
但問題不大 或許很小很輕微
Certainly weak, maybe small or even thin.

251
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,510
這樣的製造混亂 然後進行攻擊的行為 會表現在不明嫌犯生活中的所有方面
And an unsub who creates chaos and then attacks typically carries this through to all aspects of his life.

252
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,310
所以他不可能維持一段正常關係
He's unlikely to be in a relationship.

253
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,700
或者在一段關係中 他會是暴力的一方 他很享受他的控制欲
If he is, it's an abusive one. This guy gets off on control.

254
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,920
他會很關注調查進度
He will have tried to stay very close to the investigation.

255
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,040
他很清楚 警長已經開始調查失蹤的非法移民
He's well aware that the sheriff has started looking into the missing illegal immigrants.

256
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,310
你是怎麼看出來的?
How do you know that?

257
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,620
這很有可能是他開始斬首的原因 作為對你的應對對策
It's probably why the decapitations started, as a countermeasure.

258
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,360
他想叫停這個調查
He's trying to throw off the investigation.

259
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,970
這是有組織罪犯的慣用手段
It's typical in an organized offender like this.

260
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,150
Cary Stayner 優勝美地國家公園殺手 故意開車到50英里以外的十字路口
Cary stayner, the yosemite killer, drove more than 50 miles to dump cigarette packs

261
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,250
扔掉他的煙盒和駕照來擺脫自己的嫌疑
And driver's licenses at intersections to throw off suspicion.

262
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,770
從你們已經問過話的 和這些謀殺有關係的人開始著手
Start by looking back at everyone you've talked to in connection with these killings.

263
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,660
和那些熟悉移民的偷渡路線的人開始
We need to start with people who are familiar with the immigrant journey.

264
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,910
例如像誰? 擁護者? 沒人會跟我們說話的 我們已經試過了
Like who? Advocates? None of them will talk to us. I've tried.

265
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,680
蛇頭們希望這個人能消失
Well,the coyotes want this guy caught.

266
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,880
他在損害他們的生意
He's hurting their business.

267
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,150
如果那些擁護者們真的關心那些移民
And if the advocates really care about the immigrants,

268
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,860
他們也想把這個人給揪出來
They're gonna want to find whoever is responsible as well.

269
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,870
有個人或許能幫上忙
There's one guy who could help.

270
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,320
他運營著一個叫Libertad的擴大項目
He runs an outreach program called libertad.

271
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,010
在哪堹鄑鋮鴠L?
Where can we find him?

272
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,880
Clyde 你想帶他們去見Richard Corral嗎?
Clyde,you want to take them over to meet richard corral?

273
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,810
真是我的幸運日啊
My lucky day.

274
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,940
這些FBI探員想跟你談會
These fbi agents want a word with you.

275
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,820
瘸腿 看到嗎?
See the limp?

276
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,260
嗨 寶貝女 我需要你幫我查一個人
Hey,baby girl, i need you to run a check on someone for me.

277
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,080
你有毛病啊 Clyde?
What is wrong with you, clyde?

278
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,480
如果聯邦探員出現在我地盤 我的顧客還會再相信我嗎
None of my clients will trust me if i've got federal agents walking around here.

279
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,710
或許你不應該把你的時間花在 幫非法移民偷渡進國家
Well,maybe you shouldn't spend your time helping illegals sneak into the country.

280
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,970
- 他們只是想要一個更好的生活 - 那他們就應該通過合法途徑
- They only want a better life. - Well,then,they ought to come in the front door.

281
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,560
先生們 改天再吵吧?
Uh,gentlemen, another day?

282
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,840
Corral先生 我們理解你的猶豫
Mr. Corral, we understand your hesitation,

283
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,270
但今天 我們不是為了移民政策來的 是為了謀殺
But we aren't here about immigration, we're here about murder.

284
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,750
你知道前幾天放在警長辦公室門前 那些被砍下的頭嗎?
Do you know anything about the heads that were left in front of the sheriff's station a few days ago?

285
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,480
誰不知道 我的顧客都害怕死了
Everyone does. My clients are terrified.

286
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,030
- 顧客... - 副警長...
- Clients. - Deputy...

287
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,170
昨晚 又有一個人被殺了  一個移民
Another man was murdered last night. An immigrant.

288
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,260
我們需要知道 兇手是怎麼找到他的受害人的
We need to figure out how this man finds his victims.

289
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,660
Ruiz警長說 你比任何人都清楚 非法移民的偷渡路線
Sheriff ruiz said you know more about these people's journey than anyone.

290
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,790
- 是的 - 他們要穿過多少地方?
- Yeah. - How many places are there to cross?

291
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,440
從我們能找到的隧道看來 還有12條隧道沒找到
For every tunnel we find, there's 12 more we don't know about.

292
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,310
當他們穿過了邊境以後呢?
And once they've made it?

293
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,630
蛇頭把檔案都放在他們的卡車上
Runners keep documents in the trunks of their cars.

294
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,960
護照 假社保號 綠卡什麼的
Passports,fake social security numbers, green cards.

295
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,680
這是一盤大生意 特別是在邊境城鎮
It's a big business. Especially in border towns.

296
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,880
你都認識這些蛇頭嗎?
Do you know these runners?

297
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,450
他們老是換人
They change all the time.

298
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,140
如果偷渡的人沒來找你 他們會怎麼辦?
If immigrants don't find you,where do they go?

299
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,760
安全屋 他們本來能在那休息  找到水和食物 
Safe houses. It's supposed to be where they can find rest, water,food.

300
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,470
本來能?
Supposed to be?

301
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,170
其實更像是監獄 他們只能一直待在那 直到他們的家人把錢付清給蛇頭
It's more like a prison, until their families can pay off the coyotes.

302
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,580
這些安全屋都在哪?
Where are these safe houses?

303
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,550
你在開玩笑嗎? 它們出現消失得比隧道還快
Are you kidding? They come and go faster than the tunnels.

304
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,560
好的 謝謝你的寶貴時間
Ok. Thank you for your time.

305
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,220
<i>布魯克林一家人被闖入者滅口</i>

306
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,350
警長 我們的地理側寫需要幫助
Sheriff,we could use a hand with the geographical profile.

307
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,360
我們嘗試找出安全屋的地點
We're trying to locate likely safe houses.

308
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,700
你的小隊去遍了整個國家 是吧?
Your team travels all around the country, right?

309
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,040
是的
That's right.

310
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,690
我在兇案組的最後一年 經手了36個謀殺案
My last year in homicide, i handled 36 murders.

311
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,090
我的小隊堣@共20個警探 算一下吧
I was one of 20 detectives in my unit. Do the math.

312
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,230
別問我在那當中 我解決了多少個
Don't ask me how many i solved.

313
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,590
我肯定你已經盡了最大努力了
I'm sure you did the best you could.

314
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,940
就沒有一個地方人們不會互相殘殺嗎?
There really isn't anywhere to go where people aren't killing each other, is there?

315
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,910
可能的安全屋?
Likely safe houses?

316
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,900
即使我們能找到一個
Even if we could find a safe house,

317
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,090
你還真覺得一個剛剛穿過邊境的人 會和我們說話嗎?
You really think someone who just crossed is gonna talk to us?

318
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,820
昨晚的被害人很有可能不是一個人來的
Well,there's a good chance that last night's victim didn't cross alone.

319
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,210
或許有人會掛念他
Someone may be missing him.

320
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,000
如果昨晚才到的非法移民還在安全屋
If last night's illegals are still at safe houses,

321
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,170
我們就能找到他們的偷渡路線 也就知道不明嫌犯的獵殺場了
We can find the route they used and we'll know the unsub's hunting grounds.

322
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,820
安全屋的意義 就在於  它們是個秘密地點
The whole point of a safe house is it's a secret.

323
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,060
如果我能找到它們 我就會把它們搗了
If i'd could find them, i'd shut them down.

324
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,500
好吧 如果那堿O第一站 我們應該從離邊境最近的開始找
All right,if it's a first stop, we should start with homes that are closest to the border.

325
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,970
我能查一下土地契約 但會費點時間
I could pull land deeds. Might take a while.

326
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,590
我們有快一點的方法
We've got something faster.

327
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,890
- Garcia - 長官
- Garcia. - Sir.

328
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,610
我們在搜尋Terlingua的非法移民安全屋
We're looking for illegal immigrant safe houses in terlingua.

329
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,800
有哪些特徵?
What are the parameters?

330
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,350
從有犯罪記錄的房主和租客開始查
Start with homeowners and renters with criminal records.

331
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,460
好的 還有呢
That's a start. Give me more.

332
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,760
Morgan說他們不會總在一個地方 找短期租房
Morgan said they're always moving. Look for homes with short-term leases.

333
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,980
水電用量也會很高
And spikes in utilities.

334
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,500
如果是非法租房 那堨庣q量和用水量會更高
If they're housing illegals, there'll be a higher usage of power and water.

335
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,250
我正在德州所有的公共事業公司
I'm crossing with all texas utility companies.

336
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,990
找到3個地方 已經把地址發到你們手機了
And i have 3. And i just sent the addresses to your phones.

337
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,130
謝謝 Garcia
Thanks,garcia.

338
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,750
如果你們想送給我禮物 像她這樣的就最好不過了
If you're looking for a gift to get me, one of her would be greatly appreciated.

339
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,630
一定不是常規住所
We're pretty sure they broke the mold.

340
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,280
是我
Yeah.

341
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,700
如果你不停的說這違法那違法 我們可查不出什麼東西
You know,we're not going to get very far if you keep arguing about illegals with everyone.

342
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,040
- 這地方以前不是這樣的 - 什麼意思?
- This place used to be different. - How do you mean?

343
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,970
不知道 就是不同
I don't know. Different.

344
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,230
知道了 我們得對各個安全屋各個擊破
Got it,sir. We're gonna split up possible safe houses.

345
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,660
離我們最近的一個離這10分鐘
The closest one to us is 10 minutes from here.

346
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,400
- 他們不會高興見我們的 - 你有手機嗎?
- They ain't gonna be happy to see us. - You got a cell phone?

347
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,750
- 有 - 告訴我號碼
- Yeah. - Give me the number.

348
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,720
副警長 我們在後門 上前敲門
Deputy, we're at the back door. Go ahead and knock.

349
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,000
警察! 開門!
Police! Open up!

350
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,110
漂亮
Nice.

351

我在大學堿O強衛 (橄欖球堣公礙漱@種)
I played a little strong safety in college.

352
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,900
- 不知道你在說什麼 - FBI 我們有幾個問題要問你
- No idea what that means. - Fbi. We got a few questions for you.

353
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,790
我不會英語

354
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,100
FBI 我們有幾個問題要問你

355
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,240
在這堶?
In here?

356
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,740
你把他們藏在馬棚?
You keep them in a stable?

357
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,960
- 你抓住他? - 好
- You got him? - Yeah.

358
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,800
走
Go.

359
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,510
大家沒事吧?

360
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,330
還有別的人在這嗎?

361
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,340
我媽媽

362
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,980
那個男人把她帶走了

363
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,790
我聽到她哭了

364
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,370
他媽媽
His mother.

365
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,870
Prentiss.

366
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,010
拜託

367
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,240
求你們了...

368
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,520
他強姦我...

369
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,700
別讓我兒子看到我這樣子

370
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,980
Gentry! 我們需要支援和醫療隊!
Gentry! We need backup and medical units!

371
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,380
沒事了 親愛的
Esta bien,querida.

372
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,000
沒事了
Esta bien.

373
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,730
我不會讓他看見你這樣的

374
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,070
謝謝你

375
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,040
現在 你聽我說
Now,you listen to me.

376
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,960
如果你不想和我說話 沒關係 我不介意
If you don't want to talk to me,that's fine. I don't care.

377
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,930
你現在面臨強姦 綁架 持有武器的指控
But you're facing rape, kidnapping, weapons charges,

378
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,870
還有一系列走私和偷渡的聯邦共謀罪名
And numerous counts of federal conspiracy to smuggle and harbor illegal aliens.

379
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,290
這是你能幫自己的最後機會 朋友
This is your last chance to help yourself,my friend.

380
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,470
他看起來一點都不在意
He doesn't look concerned.

381
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,430
因為整個邊境的狀況非常混亂
It's because the whole border situation is chaos.

382
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,360
他被驅逐出境的可能 和入獄的可能差不多
He has as much chance of just getting deported as he does of doing prison time.

383
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,670
我來打幾個電話 看看能不能走點關係
I'll make some calls, see if i can pull some federal strings.

384
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,600
你們走了 誰來幫我們走關係?
Who's gonna pull the strings when you go home?

385
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,790
我們在沙漠中間

386
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,640
我丈夫...

387
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,850
他一直在生病...

388
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,160
...跟不上我們

389
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,610
他不讓我們留下陪他

390
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,450
她丈夫病了 所以落後
Her husband was sick and he stayed behind.

391
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,840
和其他人一樣
Just like the others.

392
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,180
還記得什麼途中的事嗎?

393
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,460
太陽

394
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,620
我看到了太陽

395
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,300
你是說"月亮"

396
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,930
那是晚上 我的寶貝

397
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,510
他是說月亮
El quiere decir la luna.

398
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,600
不 那是太陽

399
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,690
- 他能喝點飲料嗎? - 可以 當然可以
- Can he have soda? - Yeah. Yeah,of course.

400
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,910
來吧 勇敢的孩子 我們去喝飲料
Come on,big man, let's get a soda.

401
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,910
你會找到我丈夫的 對不對?

402
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,520
求你了
Por favor.

403
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,690
我不是一小時以前就讓你回去了嗎
I thought i sent you home an hour ago.

404
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,450
是 但是有點事困擾我
Yeah,uh,something's bugging me.

405
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,850
那個男孩說 他記得偷渡過境的時候 看到了太陽
That young boy says he remembers seeing the sun when he crossed the border.

406
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,570
- 他們是晚上過境的 - 是 我知道 它讓我想起了什麼
- They crossed at night. - Yeah,i know. It got me thinking.

407
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,020
某處舊馬棚邊有一幅很大的壁畫 畫的是太陽
There's a big mural on the side of an old barn. It's of the sun.

408
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,460
- 離這多遠? - 大約15分鐘
- How far out? - About 15 minutes.

409
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,020
- 要一起來嗎? - 好的
- Want to take a ride? - Sure.

410
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,740
我覺著自己從沒來過這地兒
Don't think i've been out this way.

411
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,060
我小時候來這
I used to ride out here when i was a kid.

412
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,380
- 騎馬來的? - 全地形車
- Horses? - Atvs.

413
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,650
從沒坐過
Never been on one of those.

414
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,950
開得時候得小心了 很容易受傷的
Yeah,you gotta be careful with them. You can wreck pretty good.

415
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,240
從小到大我只能騎自行車 還得時刻提防被人偷走
Growing up,all i ever had was a bicycle if i could keep it long enough before it got stolen to ride it.

416
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,880
住城奡N這點不好 對吧
Good reason to hate the city,right?

417
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,900
算是缺點之一
One of them.

418
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:00,260
那兒 跟那孩子描述的很像
There. It looks a lot like the kid described.

419
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,000
Santa Muerte 和太陽
Santa muerte and the sun.

420
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,620
做的很好 Boyd
That's good police work, boyd.

421
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,110
你覺得FBI的側寫做的怎麼樣?
Hey,what do you think about that profile the fbi gave?

422
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,060
問我的意見?
What do i think?

423
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,850
雖然受害者年長或有殘疾 他也可能 無法在他們最強的狀態下擊倒他們
He may not be capable of taking them on in their strongest state, despite their age or infirmity.

424
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,600
他們說那個男人是個懦夫
They said the guy was a coward.

425
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,710
殺了那麼多人 他就是個混蛋
Anyone kills that many people has gotta be a real bad-ass.

426
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,120
襲擊那些手無縛雞之力的人 在我們那兒 都被叫做膽小鬼
Well,where i come from, preying on people who can't defend themselves makes him a punk-ass.

427
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,130
懦夫
A coward.

428
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,500
把死人頭插在你房子外面 這可不像懦夫
Putting a man's head outside your house hardly seems like a coward.

429
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,020
你腿怎麼了 Boyd?
Something wrong with your leg,boyd?

430
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,810
我十幾歲時腿嚴重骨折過
Yeah,i busted it up pretty bad when i was a teenager.

431
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,410
幾乎沒法跑步
Can't hardly run anymore.

432
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,490
每次臨下雨前都疼得要死
Ooh,it hurts like a bitch every time it's gonna rain now.

433
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,920
這意味著他有可能在某方面有殘障 但問題不大 
He's possibly handicapped in some way himself. Certainly weak.

434
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,210
或許很小很輕微
Maybe small or even thin.

435
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,870
我不知道你的腿行動不便
I didn't know you had a bad leg.

436
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,660
- 你對我一無所知 - 你說什麼?
- You didn't know anything about me. - Excuse me?

437
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,640
你從紐約來 然後接管一切
You just came from new york and took over,

438
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,930
只盯著些容易解決的事兒
sticking your nose in things that were going just fine.

439
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,540
你是說那些失蹤案?
You're talking about the missings?

440
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,720
失蹤案 如果那些人一開始
The missing.Now,how could someone be missing

441
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:26,070
就不該出現在這兒 又怎麼會失蹤呢?
if they ain't supposed to be here in the first damn place?

442
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,890
他們會把一切責任推給Omar
They're gonna blame it all on omar.

443
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,940
我可以擺脫那個賤人和你了
I can get rid of that son of a bitch and you.

444
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,540
為什麼這兒做 Boyd?
Why,boyd?

445
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,580
為什麼? 為什麼不呢?
Why? Why not?

446
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,090
- 你沒法成功的 - 我得試試
- You won't make it. - I gotta try.

447
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,580
我知道
Yeah,i know.

448
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,960
警察都到哪兒去了?
Where are all the deputies?

449
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,510
也許他們發現了另一顆頭
Maybe they found another head.

450
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,230
不會 不然警長會通知我們的 你今早見到她了嗎?
No,the sheriff would have contacted us. Have you heard from her this morning?

451
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,630
沒有 長官 本來也沒指望見到她
No,sir,i wasn't expecting to,though.

452
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,460
JJ 跟我來
Jj,come with me.

453
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,060
收到 第三分隊 隨時更新你的進展
10-4,unit 3. Keep us posted on your progress.

454
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,160
發生什麼了?
What's going on?

455
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,040
警長失蹤了
It's the sheriff. She's missing.

456
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,840
今早她沒出現
She never came in this morning.

457
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,900
巡邏警車也失蹤了 整個部門都在尋找她
Her cruiser's missing,too. The whole department's looking for her.

458
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,770
她對你說過什麼嗎? 她有沒有在跟進什麼?
Did she say anything to you? Was she working on something?

459
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,620
她昨晚比我們先離開
She was gone before we left here last night.

460
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,570
- 去哪兒了? - 我想她是回家了
- Gone where? - I thought she went home.

461
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,730
讓Garcia追蹤她的電話 看看她昨晚 有沒有電話打進來
Have garcia trace her cell phone. See if she had any incoming calls last night.

462
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,640
這是Boyd 上帝啊 我找到她了
This is boyd. Oh,god. I found her.

463
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:53,320
天 她...請求支援 快!
God,she's all... Just get me some help. Hurry.

464
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,990
- 副警長 - 他做了什麼?
- Deputy. - What he did...

465
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,580
- 是警長嗎? - 沒錯 是她
- It's the sheriff? - Yeah. Yeah,it's her.

466
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,810
這次不一樣 充斥了憤怒
This isn't the same. This is angry.

467
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,340
過度殺戮
And overkill.

468
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,470
作案模式完全不同
It's a completely different m.o.

469
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,340
新的被害者類型
and a new victimology.

470
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:23,180
他不僅能辨別非法移民  還認得出執法官員?
He goes from impossible to identify illegal immigrants to a law enforcement officer?

471
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,880
側寫中說這男人出於膽小 會挑體弱的人下手
We're profiling a guy who picks on the weakest in a crowd.

472
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,920
我不大瞭解警長  不過她絕不是手無縛雞之力
I didn't know her that well, but weak doesn't seem to fit the sheriff.

473
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,450
- 這不是隨機下手 - 此話怎講?
- It's also not random. - How so?

474
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,820
Omar Morales說過 換作他會這麼做 以發出信息
It's what omar morales said he would do to a body to send a message.

475
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,410
他會這樣子肢解屍體?
He'd tear someone up like that?

476
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,980
這跟他描述的一樣 內臟 頭 舌頭
That's exactly what he said he would do. The evisceration, hand,the tongue.

477
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,930
我和Ruiz在審訊室堮 他說的
He told ruiz and i when we first came into the interrogation room.

478
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,360
- 我們是取證組 - 那邊
- We're the evidence team. - Right there.

479
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,150
- 是她嗎? - 她的一部分
- Is it her? - What's left of her.

480
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,690
車埵酗偵繲?
Is there anything in the car?

481
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,970
沒發現她昨晚去了哪兒
Nothing that would indicate where she was headed last night.

482
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,070
沒筆記 沒日記
There's no notebooks, no log.

483
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,220
肢解方式 和毒販Omar Morales 描述得一模一樣
Her body is mutilated in exactly the way that omar morales,

484
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,220
The drug trafficker, said he would mutilate a body.

485
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,210
側寫指出不明嫌犯和這次的調查關繫緊密
We did profile the unsub would be someone close to the investigation.

486
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,900
可只有Ruiz和我聽到了他的話
But only ruiz and i heard him say it.

487
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,870
所以這都是Omar干的?
So omar looks good for this?

488
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,790
可他幹嗎要殺了全鎮唯一相信 他不是不明嫌犯的人呢?
Except why would he kill the one person in town who didn't think he was the unsub?

489
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,310
Garcia說昨晚九點以後 警長辦公室就沒活動了
Garcia says there's no activity on the sheriff's cell past 9 p.m.

490
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,780
昨晚我們到達時 誰還在局子?
Does anybody remember who was at the station last night when we arrived?

491
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,120
警察局?
The station?

492
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,930
警長被肢解了 和那毒販描述的一模一樣
The sheriff's body was mutilated exactly the way the drug trafficker said he would do it.

493
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,370
- 一模一樣嗎? 舌頭也割了? - 你也聽到了?
- Oh,no,all of it? The tongue,too? - You heard that?

494
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,060
你們和他交談的時候我站在窗戶那兒
Yeah,i was at the window when you were talking to him.

495
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,810
- 牆上有個揚聲器 - 還有誰在那兒?
- There was a speaker on the wall. - Was anybody else there?

496
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,220
Boyd副警長
Yeah,deputy boyd.

497
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,870
Gannon副警長 Boyd副警長在哪兒?
Deputy gannon, where's deputy boyd?

498
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,380
他和Gentry去接他了
Him and gentry went to pick him up.

499
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,490
- 接誰? - Omar Morales
- Pick up who? - Omar morales.

500
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,210
你打算怎麼做?
How do you want to play this?

501
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,680
Boyd!
Boyd!

502
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,180
別幹傻事 Jose
Don't do something stupid,jose.

503
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,620
嘿 別這樣 有話咱好好說
Hey,take it easy. We can work this out.

504
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,410
Boyd! 你他娘的到底在幹啥?
Boyd! What the hell are you doing?

505
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,360
這可不會有用啊
This ain't gonna stick, you know.

506
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,130
Ronny 你都幹了些什麼啊?
Ronny,what did you do?

507
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,310
- 他有槍 - 什麼?
- He had a gun. - What?

508
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,630
他有槍
He had a gun.

509
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,570
Ronny 他沒有
Ronny,he ain't got no gun.

510
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,200
我只能開槍
I had to shoot him.

511
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,370
- 他殺了兩個警察 - 什麼?
- He killed two cops. - What?

512
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,110
- Gentry - Gentry 我是Prentiss探員
- Gentry. - Gentry,this is agent prentiss.

513
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,960
如果他在你旁邊 別說話
If he's near you, please don't say anything.

514
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,400
我們認為Boyd副警長就是不明嫌犯
We think the unsub may be deputy boyd.

515
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,670
Gentry 你在聽嗎?
Gentry,are you there?

516
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,420
- Reid JJ 待在這 保持警惕 - 好的
- Reid,jj,stay out here and stay alert. - Yeah.

517
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,210
是Gentry
It's gentry.

518
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,140
你覺得這合理嗎?
Does this look legit to you?

519
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,960
Omar是被散彈獵槍打中的 Gentry只有把手槍
Omar took shotgun hits. Gentry only has a pistol.

520
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,940
Omar兩隻手上也都沒有火藥殘餘
There's no powder residue on omar's hands,either.

521
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,020
哦 我的天 萬一是他接的電話呢?
Oh,my god. What if he heard me?

522
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,640
- Gannon Boyd會去哪? - 不知道
- Gannon, where would boyd go? - I don't know.

523
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,260
沒時間包庇他了  他殺了你們的頭還有Gentry
This is no time to be covering up. He killed your boss and gentry.

524
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,960
我沒包庇他 我真不知道  我不是很瞭解他 沒人瞭解
I'm not covering. I don't know the guy that well. No one does.

525
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,950
他總是獨來獨往
He's a loner.

526
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,630
- 大人 - Garcia  Boyd副警長 就是不明嫌犯 他有警用無線電
- My liege. - Garcia,deputy boyd is our unsub. He has a police radio.

527
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,790
- 你能追蹤到嗎? - 可以 單位號是多少?
- Can you track it? - Yeah. What's his unit number?

528
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,450
打電話給警長辦公室  問調度員序列號
Call the sheriff's station. Get the serial numbers from the dispatcher.

529
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,470
好 我再打給你
Ok,i'll get back to you.

530
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,620
- 我們側寫他是個獵人 - 現在是獵物了
- We profiled him as a hunter. - Well, now he's the hunted.

531
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,080
他一定會去讓他有安全感的地方
He'll go someplace he feels safe.

532
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,460
- 他能控制的地方 - 回家?
- Someplace he knows he can control. - Home?

533
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,950
不會 應該是事先設計好的地方
No,i think a preplanned location.

534
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,880
長官 發現他了 他在往北的方向
Sir,i've got him. He's heading northbound.

535
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:19,220
- 州際公路? - 不是  他根本沒開上路 他在沙漠媔}
- Interstate? - No,he is not on a road at all. He's driving through the desert.

536
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,520
- 繼續追蹤 Garcia - 他想逃跑
- Keep tracking him,garcia. - He's running.

537
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,970
肯定不是跑回家  他住在城外西邊的一部拖車
Not home for sure. He lives in a trailer out west of town.

538
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,740
那他是要跑去哪?
So where's he running to?

539
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,710
Morgan Prentiss Reid 副警長 你帶他們去拖車 看能發現點什麼
Morgan,prentiss,reid-- deputy, you take them to his house, see what you can find.

540
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,100
把你無線電給我
I need your radio.

541
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,600
- 你要怎麼做? - 不讓他閒著
- What are you gonna do? - Keep him busy.

542
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,500
副警長Boyd  我是FBI的Hotchner探員
Deputy boyd, this is agent hotchner with the fbi.

543
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,650
我知道你能聽到我 你無處可逃
I know you can hear me. You have no place to go.

544
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,240
這沙漠是我的地盤
This is my desert.

545
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,260
你以為能把我找出來麼 哼 試試吧
You think you can find me out here, yeah,well,come on out.

546
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,830
自以為了不起的混蛋
Cocky little bastard.

547
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,430
問題是他說得沒錯  我們對這沙漠一無所知
The trouble is he's right. We don't know anything about this desert.

548
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,620
也許他們能發現點線索
Hope they can find something.

549
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,410
哦 天啊
Oh,god.

550
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,410
看來我們真是找對地方了
Well,we're definitely in the right place.

551
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,960
和平常一樣呼吸就好了  嗅覺是最弱的感官知覺
Just breathe through your nose like normal. Smell is the weakest sense.

552
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,980
過個幾分鐘 你就聞不出什麼了
In a few more minutes, you won't even notice it.

553
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,020
那味覺呢?
What about the taste?

554
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,040
那是你自己想的
I think that's in your head.

555
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,120
好 分頭找吧 看看這傢伙要去哪
All right,spread out. Let's find out where this guy's headed here.

556
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,630
Boyd 沒必要讓這一切變得更糟的
Boyd,this doesn't have to end any worse than it already is.

557
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,110
- 怎麼說? - 你自首 我會和法官說你很合作
- Is that right? - Turn yourself in. I'll tell the judge you cooperated.

558
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,600
這兒是德克薩斯 探員  你以為法官在能判人死刑時
This is texas,agent.You think the judge gives a damn

559
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,670
還會在乎他有沒有合作嗎?
whether or not someone cooperated when he's handing out the death penalty?

560
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,720
別理解錯了
Now,don't get me wrong.

561
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,020
我也會用一樣的方式結束這一切
I wouldn't have it any other way.

562
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,850
那是對付我這種人唯一的方式
That's the only way to deal with someone like me.

563
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,630
他會自殺嗎?
Think he's suicidal?

564
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,480
- 要不就是嚇唬人 - 北邊有什麼東西?
- Or he's bluffing. - What's north of here?

565
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:51,790
- 空空如也 - 他一點也不驚慌
- A whole lot of nothing. - He's not panicking.

566
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,810
那兒一定有什麼東西吸引著他
There's something out there, and he's headed for it.

567
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,170
哦 天哪 我發現那氣味是哪來的了
Oh,god. I found where the source of that smell is coming from.

568
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,990
哦 我的天
Oh,my god.

569
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,180
這就是他砍人頭的地方了
Well,this is where he decapitated them.

570
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,410
夥計們 來看這個
Guys,come look at this.

571
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,830
我一直等著嗅覺失靈呢 Reid
I'm ready for that smell weakness to kick in anytime,reid.

572
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,920
你們聽 "金色收穫穀物供給倉庫
Listen."golden harvest grain and feed

573
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,860
今天又一次遭受了因組長Fred Boyd 死亡而起的控制權之爭"
"suffered another setback today in a ruling over the death of foreman fred boyd."

574

Boyd死了 其子Ronald活了下來
"boyd survived by his son ronald."

575
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,030
上次那個受害人的孩子不是說 在路上看到了太陽嗎?
Didn't the last victim's child say that he saw the sun when he crossed?

576
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,980
- 是有 - 金色收穫 就在城外北邊
- Yeah. - Golden harvest, that's out north of town.

577
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,730
長官 我--我追蹤不到他了  訊號消失了
Sir,i--i lost him. The signal's gone.

578
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,260
他弄壞了無線電
He smashed the radio.

579
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,580
Garcia 給我張信號 最後出現的衛星照片
Garcia,i need a satellite photo of the last place that the signal showed.

580
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,350
那堣@定有什麼是地圖上沒顯示的
There's something out there that's not on the map.

581
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,370
是 長官 我正在弄
Yes,sir,i'm already working on that.

582
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,300
去北邊
Let's head north.

583
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,370
Hotch 城北有一個叫金色收穫的 很舊的穀物供給倉庫
Hotch,there's an old grain and feed barn north of town called golden harvest.

- Ok,right. We'll see you there. - His victims.

587
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,970
Reid 你在這留守現場好吧?
Reid,i want you to stay with the crime scene, all right?

588
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,910
我打電話給州里的和當地的同事
I'll call the state and local bureau offices.

589
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,430
他們會馬上趕過來的

別在車媔}槍

591
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,380
- 你意思是別震聾你? - 對

592
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,560
那是他的車
There's his vehicle.

593
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,780
你走側門 我從前門入

594
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,940
注意上面的窗戶
Watch the windows up top.

00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,540
- 你能開槍嗎? - 我什麼都看不見

- Prentiss,look out! - I got him,i got him.

597
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,660

You all right?

598
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,570
- 沒事 - 有事!
- Yeah. - No!

599
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,140
你是不是瘋了? 我耳膜都震破了
Are you out of your mind? You blew out my eardrum.

600
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,750
那你想讓我怎麼辦?  他衝著我們就過來了
What did you want me to do? He was coming right at us.

601
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,400
我說了我能搞定的
I told you i had him.

602
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,810
他都朝我們開槍了 Emily
He was shooting at us, emily.

603
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,640
那你至少能提醒我下吧
Well,you could have given me a heads-up.

604
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,550
這可是把上了膛的mp-5衝鋒鎗和 往我們亂掃的瘋子啊? 行了
The loaded mp-5 and the lunatic shooting at us wasn't enough? Come on.

605
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,660
上邊派過來一個犯罪現場小組了
The state's sending out a crime scene team.

606
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,300
沒有失蹤人口的報告 要確認屍體身份很難
It's going to be hard to identify the bodies with out missing persons reports.

607
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,730
我聯繫了那個安排移民的 Richard Corral
I called that advocate, richard corral.

608
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,280
他正在聯繫有親人失蹤的人家

609

他會試著拿到些DNA
He's gonna try and get some dna.

610
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,840
那應該能好點
That'll help.

611
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,250
這都亂套了
This is a mess.

612
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,290
沒有Ruiz警長會更亂的  還是會有人被砍頭
It would have been a bigger mess without sheriff ruiz, and it would still be happening.

613
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,590
她有什麼家人嗎?
Did she have any family?

614
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
我已經讓Garcia在查了
I already have garcia checking into it.

615
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,350
我會給布魯克林的兇殺組打電話 和我認識的幾個人說說
I'm going to call brooklyn homicide, talk to some of the guys i know there.

616
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,660
- 給她頒發獎章 - 太好了
- They'll honor her shield. - That's good.

617
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,750
從紐約警局出來的探長會很高興的
An ex-nypd detective would like that.

618
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,090
我們回去吧
Let's go home.

619
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,000
"許多人對於什麼是真正的幸福 都有著錯誤的觀念"
"many persons have the wrong idea "of what constitutes true happiness.

620
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:12,050
