1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,940
Joe 你走到哪兒了?
Joe,what's your 20?

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,330
快到頭了 我在檢查旋轉木馬
Almost done with rounds. Just checking the carousel.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,070
需要增援嗎? 我都要睡著了
You need some backup? I'm falling asleep here.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,150
不用 給我留一杯咖啡吧
No. But could you leave a cupful of coffee in the pot?

5
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,140
誰在那兒?
Anyone back here?

6
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,000
這是私有財產
This is private property.

7
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,460
5秒鐘之內出來
I'm gonna give you 5 seconds to come on out.

8
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,830
好玩是吧 Don
Funny,don.

9
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,000
我就是找點樂子 開個小玩笑嘛
I'm a man of simple pleasures, and that was one of them.

10
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,380
你在那兒幹嗎?
What are you doing back here?

11
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,170
調整一下校時齒帶 你在這兒幹什麼?
Switching out a timing belt. What are you doing back here?

12
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,770
我好像看見有人在這兒
Thought I saw someone messing around.

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,640
- 沒有 就我一個人 - 不是你
- Nah,it was just me. - It wasn't you.

14
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,250
- 讓它停下 - 什麼?
- Turn it off. - What?

15
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,580
關掉!
Turn it off!

16
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,670
什麼?
What?

17
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,820
- Ed? - 收到
- Ed? - Go ahead.

18
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,110
你得叫人來了
You need to send that backup.

19
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,600
我看5步之內將軍 你說呢?
I see checkmate in 5. What do you see?

20
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,810
我覺得只要3步
I see it in 3.

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,660
- 我們都很想你吶 - 謝謝
- We've missed you out here. - Thank you. Thanks.

22
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,220
我 呃 我需要休整一陣子
I,uh,i had to take a little break.

23
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,460
- 為什麼? - 我以前和組堛漱@個朋友下棋
- How come? - I used to play with a co-worker friend of mine.

24
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,480
他可能是我遇到的最強的對手
He's probably the best mind I ever went up against.

25
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,520
有一天 他突然決定收手了
One day,he just decided that he didn't want to play anymore.

26
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,580
- 所以你也放棄了? - 正相反
- So you gave up,too? - Just the opposite.

27
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,550
我試了棋盤上的每一步走法
I attempted to play through every permutation of moves on a chessboard.

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,380
那得玩多少盤啊
That's an infinite number of games.

29
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,890
也不是無窮無盡的 只是數量龐大而已
It's not infinite. It's just-- it's exponentially large.

30
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,430
你不可能每一種都玩到過
You couldn't have played through them all.

31
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,770
平均每盤棋要走40步 這麼說吧
There's an average of 40 moves per chess game, and i'll tell you something--

32
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,590
我下得越多 越覺得每一盤棋
The more I played, the more I realized that every single match, every single chess game,

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,820
每盤棋都只是同一個套路的不同變化
Is really just a simple variation on the exact same theme. You know?

34
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,890
激進的開局 耐心地過招 最後將軍
It's aggressive opening, patient mid-game, inevitable checkmate,

35
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,730
於是我明白他為什麼不再下棋了
And I realized why my friend quit.

36
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,730
他厭倦了週而復始的方式 想要有不同的結果
He was tired of repeating the exact same patterns and expecting a different outcome.

37
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,050
你是說你有用不完的招數 就放在那兒等著積灰?
So you have a lifetime of chess strategy in your head and you're just sitting on it.

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,860
<i>JJ: 有案子</i>

39
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,060
我還是會用到的 只不過
I still use it. I just,uh...

40
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,460
用在別的地方 我得走了
I apply it differently. I have to go.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,310
很高興見到你
It was good seeing you.

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,410
Rita Stuart 25歲 大西洋城的第二名受害者
Rita stuart,25, second victim in atlantic city.

43
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,770
棄屍地點很引人注目
Pretty public spot for a dump site.

44
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,800
嚴格地說 我覺得是陳屍地點
You know,technically, I think it would qualify more as a disposal site.

45
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,350
沒人會隨便把屍體扔在旋轉木馬上
You don't leave a body on a merry-go-round out of convenience.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,080
他還下功夫打扮了一番 不是嗎?
He took some time with her appearance,didn't he?

47
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,420
指甲磨過 頭髮剪過 衣服是全新的
Yeah. Her nails were polished, her hair was cut, clothes were brand-new.

48
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,850
希望她被發現的時候好看 這帶有明顯的自責
Wants her to look her best when found. That's a lot of remorse.

49
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,790
- 第一個受害人是誰? - Stacia Jackson 29歲
- Who is victim number one? - Stacia jackson,29.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,690
在當地的一個遊樂場媯o現的
She was found at a local playground.

51
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,420
被害者類型發生變化了
A change in victimology.

52
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,810
這些女性之間有什麼聯繫?
What's the connection between these women?

53
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,380
什麼都沒有 Rita已婚 Stacia還單身
There is none. Rita was married, stacia was single.

54
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,030
Rita在小餐館工作 Stacia是公司法律顧問
Rita worked at a diner, stacia was a corporate lawyer.

55
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,230
根據信用卡記錄 她們的活動範圍相去甚遠
According to their credit cards, they never came within 10 miles of each other.

56
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,920
這兩人都是兩個月前被綁架的?
Both women were taken 2 months ago?

57
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,030
是的 她們過著完全不同的生活
Yeah. They lived such completely different lives,

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,810
警方之前並未把兩起綁架聯繫在一起 直到現在
The police didn't tie their abduction together until now.

59
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,760
有過性侵犯嗎?
Was there any evidence of sexual assault?

60
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,260
沒有任何暴力的痕跡
There was no evidence of violence of any kind.

61
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,630
那她們是怎麼死的?
So how did they die?

62
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,670
Rita死於中風 Stacia是腦出血
Rita had a stroke, stacia had a brain hemorrhage.

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,440
看這個 不明嫌犯給他們注射藥物 卡肌寧 多沙氯銨
Look at this, the unsub gave them a battery of drugs-- atracurium,doxacurium.

64
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,900
都是神經抑製藥物 阻礙大腦傳向肌肉的信號
These are neural inhibitors. They block signals from the brain to the muscles.

65
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,110
他讓她們藥物昏迷兩個月
He put them in medical comas for 2 months.

66
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,430
實際上 她們沒有昏迷
Actually, they weren't in a coma.

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,130
還需要鎮靜安眠劑才能昏迷 她們沒有
You'd need phenobarbital to keep them unconscious, and they didn't have that.

68
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,570
等等 受害者被麻痹了但是還有意識?
So,wait a minute. These victims were paralyzed but they were still conscious?

69
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,860
她們看得見 聽得見 可能還有痛感
They could open their eyes,hear, probably even feel stimulation.

70
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,510
身體靜止但是頭腦清醒
Physical immobility but mental awareness.

71
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,310
不明嫌犯想要完全控制她們
This unsub wants total domination over them.

72
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,410
為此 他把她們完全禁錮起來
And he turns their bodies into prisons to do it.

73

74
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:07,487
Mildred Lisette Norman寫道 (美國和平主義者)
Mildred lisette norman wrote,

75
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:13,087
"任何你不願放棄的東西 一旦超出它的效用 就會佔有你"
"anything you cannot relinquish "when it has outlived its usefulness, "possesses you,

76
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:19,437
"而在這個物慾橫流的時代 很多人被他們的財產所掌控"
"and in this materialistic age, a great many of us are possessed by our possessions."

77
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:24,607
讓女性癱瘓但保有意識 性虐待狂的表現
Keeping women in a conscious paralysis reads as sadism.

78
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,617
滅絕人性 把她們當做物品對待
Definitely dehumanizing, reducing them to objects.

79
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:30,677
可是只有側寫 沒有其他佐證
But there's nothing else about this profile that takes us down that path.

80
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,657
這些女性死的時候都很健康
These women were found in excellent condition.

81
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:36,137
沒有褥瘡 通過靜脈注射供給營養
There was no evidence of bed sores, they were well fed through an i.v.

82
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,967
可以接觸到注射用品和藥物
His access to i.v.s and drugs--

83
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,847
他一定有些醫學基礎
He almost certainly has medical training.

84
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,847
嫌犯確定是男性嗎?
Are we sure this is a he?

85
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:44,417
他對受害人的關照
The care this unsub shows these victims,

86
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:48,017
雖然慘無人道 但側寫表明是女性所為
although they are dehumanized, the profile says female.

87
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:49,307
擺放屍體的時候怎麼辦?
What about the postmortem posing?

88
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,477
女性可搬不動那麼重的屍體
That's a lot of dead weight for a woman to carry.

89
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:54,597
這些女人都很嬌小 還不到90斤重
These women are petite. They're under 100 pounds.

90
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:57,407
好吧 重新側寫了性別 還有什麼變化?
All right,if we reconsider the gender of the profile, what changes?

91
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:59,777
一樣的 只會更靠譜
Nothing. If anything, it fits better.

92
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:03,317
男性為了滿足性衝動殺人 女性不會
Men kill to fulfill a sexual compulsion. Women don't.

93
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:06,497
這在妥善處理屍體的女性殺手中很常見 比如Genene Jones和Amy Archer
You see this in angel of mercy killers, like genene jones and amy archer.

94
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:09,357
她們無所謂人種或者頭髮顏色 男人才會在意
They didn't care about race or hair color. It's men that do.

95
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,057
頂起 只有男人才會在意
Damn straight. Men do.

96
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:14,617
嗨 紅頭髮 你看你 夥計們
Well,hello,red. Look at you. Guys.

97
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:18,887
Garcia 從不明嫌犯給被害人 穿的衣服上有什麼發現?
Garcia,what did you find out about the clothing the unsub's dressing the victims in?

98
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,387
首先兩件衣服都是雪紡綢的
At first only that both garments were made from chiffon,

99
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:25,037
但是有大西洋城警方的通力合作 和我對時尚的敏銳洞察力
But with the wonder twin powers of the atlantic city police and my impeccable eye for fashion,

100
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:28,757
我們發現這些衣服都超級合身
We have also determined that these garments fit ridiculously well.

101
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,357
很貼合受害人的身材
They're super flattering to each victim's exact measurements,

102
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:35,077
像是不明嫌犯親手做的
Kind of exactly like the unsub whipped them up herself.

103
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,817
- 這就是受害者之間的聯繫吧 - 怎麼說?
- Maybe that's what connects the victims. - How so?

104
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:40,167
也許她殺害較小的女性
Maybe she isn't just killing petite women

105
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:44,487
不只是因為她們容易被誘拐 而是因為特定的體形
Because they're easier to abduct and pose but because of a physical type.

106
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,037
她需要某種身材
She wants a body type.

107
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:48,357
為她們製作特別尺寸的衣服
Sewing clothes for a specific size of woman.

108
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:52,137
別告訴我她殺了這些人 只是想要人體模特
Please tell me she is not killing these women because she needs human models.

109
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,957
肯定還得有別的理由吧
I mean,there's gotta be more to it than that.

110
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:55,467
說不定是有
There probably is.

111
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,587
起碼在受害人研究上有進展了
But at least we have a start on the victimology.

112
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,957
Prentiss和Morgan去找受害人家屬
Prentiss and morgan, I want you to interview the victims' families.

113
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,957
瞭解她們的生活方式
Talk to them about lifestyle choices.

114
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:04,397
對於身材形象有沒有什麼顧慮
Any body image issues these women may have had.

115
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:06,557
Reid 去Rita Stuart的驗屍官那
Reid,go to rita stuart's autopsy,

116
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:10,507
看看不明嫌犯用的藥物 有什麼特殊的地方
See if the drugs point to any specific medical training the unsub might have had.

117
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:12,077
Dave和我去陳屍地點
Dave and I will go to the disposal site.

118
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:13,267
- 還有 Garcia - 在
- And,garcia. - Sir.

119
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,727
你去查一下過去兩個月的失蹤人口記錄
I want you to check missing persons reports for the last 2 months.

120
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:17,867
看看有沒有類似的綁架案件
See if any abductions match what we know.

121
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,497
我們得確定不明嫌犯有沒有拐走其他人
We need to find out if the unsub's already taken another victim.

122
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:30,177
<i>亞特蘭大城警局</i>
<i>******</i>

123
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,977
Jareau探員? 我是Marty Cotrone警探
Agent jareau? Detective marty cotrone.

124
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,887
這兩位是特別督察探員 Morgan和Prentiss
These are ssas morgan and prentiss.

125
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,317
- 你聯繫到家屬了嗎? - 他們已經到了
- Were you able to contact the families? - They're already here.

126
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,167
他們帶了我們要的照片嗎?
Did they bring the pictures we asked for?

127
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:39,657
是的 這讓他們很困惑
Yeah. They were pretty confused by that.

128
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,527
坦白說 我也不是很懂
And to be honest, so am i.

129
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,587
Morgan探員 我不明白
Agent morgan, I don't understand.

130
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:49,087
我女兒長什麼樣子和 殺了她的兇手有什麼關係?
How does what my daughter looked like have to do with the monster who killed her?

131
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:51,997
我們認為 不明嫌犯尋找的是某種身材
We think the unsub is looking for a physical type.

132
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,527
健美 但是小巧
Fit but petite.

133
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:57,527
就是她 這是我老婆
This is her. This is my wife.

134
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,367
她經常去塑身嗎?
********

135
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:01,777
是的 我猜是的
Sure. I guess.

136
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:04,247
她一周至少去3次健身房
She went to the gym at least 3 times a week.

137
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:07,037
Stacia對她的外表引以為傲
Stacia took pride in every aspect of her appearance.

138
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:07,977
哪方面?
In what way?

139
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:10,527
她的衣服什麼的 她很喜歡逛街
You know,her clothes. It was her clothes. She loved to shop.

140
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:13,267
看起來她走的是波西米亞路線
It looks like she has kind of a bohemian streak going on.

141
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:14,257
是啊
Yeah.

142
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:16,757
她一般都去哪兒逛街?
What were her favorite places to shop?

143
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:18,267
高檔商店
High-end boutiques.

144
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,687
- 很貴的那種? - 是的
- Expensive ones? - Certainly.

145
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,277
- 穿著很得體 - 她很細緻
- And dressed to fit. - She was tiny.

146
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:28,727
每件事都要考慮到 所以她很在意外表
Everything had to be taken in so she'd look... Her best.

147
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:32,137
你可以把她常去的地方寫下來嗎?
Would you mind writing down some of her favorite places to go?

148
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:35,507
這些基本都是二手商店?
So these are mostly consignment and thrift shops?

149
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:37,237
我們只買得起這樣的
That's really all we could afford.

150
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:40,057
她有去修改過這些衣服嗎?
Did she ever have these clothes altered?

151
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,097
讓裁縫改一下好更合身?
Uh,tailored to fit her better?

152
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,107
我沒有注意過
I never really paid attention.

153
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:48,457
她穿過像這樣的衣服嗎?
Would she ever have worn something like that?

154
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:54,567
她穿過這樣的衣服嗎?
Would she ever wear anything like that?

155
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,597
沒有
No.

156
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:14,007
Dave!
Dave!

157
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:16,007
- 你能聽見音樂嗎? - 能
- Can you hear that? - Yeah.

158
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:19,917
她把受害者放在一個象徵天真無邪 和童年的地方
She's posing her victims in a place that represents innocence and childhood.

159
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:24,097
大部分連環殺手都沒有特別幸福的童年
Most serial killers don't have a particularly happy childhood.

160
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:27,897
我猜她是想讓他們擁有 她從未獲得過的歡樂
My guess is she wants them to have the fun she never got to have.

161
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:29,887
讓我們設想下她是如何行動的
Let's think about how she's doing this practically.

162
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:32,377
她怎麼才能把屍體 從車上放到旋轉木馬上?
How's she getting them from her car to the carousel?

163
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:35,037
她在深夜運屍
She's moving a body in the middle of the night.

164
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,297
必須創造便利可行的條件
She needs to make conditions as favorable as possible.

165
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:41,707
那她需要一輛可以保護隱私的車子 一輛貨車或箱式車
So she'd need a vehicle that afforded her privacy-- A van or an suv.

166
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:44,477
可一旦停了車 還是有許多地方要掩蓋
That's still a lot of ground to cover once she parks.

167
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:48,707
就算這些女性很輕  她也冒著被發現運屍的危險
Even if these women are light, she risks getting caught carrying a corpse.

168
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:51,587
如果她有醫學背景 或者她使用了輪椅
If she has a medical background,what if she used a wheelchair,

169
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:53,667
一些可能幫她快速搬運的東西
Something that would help her move them quickly?

170
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:58,007
如果用輪椅 那意味著她的車有斜坡道
And if she has a wheelchair, that means her van has a lift,

171
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:00,477
可以幫助她卸載屍體
Which would be helpful to unload a body.

172
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:05,037
這也說明她有一個殘疾人停車牌
Which also means she has a handicap placard.

173
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:08,367
可以讓她就近停車
Which would give her the closest place to park.

174
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:12,817
我叫Garcia把有殘疾人停車牌的車 調出來 謝謝
I'll have garcia pull all vehicles with handicap registrations. Thanks,dave.

175
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:17,407
把膝蓋彎起來 就可以用杠桿原理把她抬起來
Once I have the knees bent, I can get leverage under her.

176
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:20,807
通常會有個助手幫我
Normally, an assistant helps me.

177
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:23,267
不過我也可以自己做 如果必須的話
But I can do it by myself if I need to.

178
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:24,997
假設不明嫌犯也有過這樣的訓練
I'm assuming the unsub would have this training,too.

179
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:27,337
我問下 這一訓練有沒有什麼特殊要求
Let me ask you this-- is there anything specific about it?

180
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:31,517
沒有 任何醫護人員都可以做到 醫生 護士 或護理員
No,any caregiver out there can do this-- docs,nurses,orderlies.

181
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,217
你覺得她用的那些藥是從哪兒弄來的?
Where do you think she's getting the drugs that she's using?

182
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:37,607
她需要操縱醫生或藥劑師嗎?
Do you think she could be manipulating a doctor or a pharmacist,maybe?

183
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:39,957
如果她操縱了的話 醫生就算是故意失職
He'd be criminally negligent if she was.

184
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:44,897
有沒有可能 醫生通過住院醫師開方 護士偽造了簽名
But it is possible. I mean,doctors order things through residents, nurses forge signatures,

185
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:46,537
處方流失了
Prescriptions fall through cracks.

186
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:49,147
那得流失大量的藥品 得是巨大的疏忽了
That's a lot of drugs and a lot of cracks.

187
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:51,427
她讓這些女性麻痹了兩個月
She keeps these women paralyzed for 2 months.

188
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:54,257
你的報告說 她們兩人都被接上了頭髮
Your report said both of them had hair extensions clipped in.

189
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:57,557
是的 為了掩蓋那些脫落的真發
Yes,to hide the fact that clumps of their real hair had fallen out.

190
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:00,607
她們被通過靜脈注射 並不是因為她們營養不良 對吧?
But if they were fed through i.v.s, that wasn't from malnutrition,right?

191
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:03,027
這在臥床不起的病人中很常見
You see this a lot in bedridden patients.

192
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:04,707
失去了運動機能
Loss of motor function.

193
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,577
特別是像這樣的年輕女性
Especially in a young woman like this.

194
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:10,677
當然 心理震驚 心理影響付出了生理代價
Of course. Psychic shock. Yeah,the mental effects take a physical toll.

195
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,717
最後一個問題 以你的專業意見
One last question-- in your professional opinion,

196
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:15,957
你覺得頭髮是在她們生前 還是死後接上的?
Do you think the hair extensions were clipped on before or after death?

197
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,317
- 生前 - 你看起來很肯定
- Before. - And you seem pretty certain of that?

198
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:22,307
你知道 老太太總說  頭髮和指甲死後還會生長
You know the old wives' tale about your hair and nails growing after death.

199
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:26,827
不過事實是 由於脫水作用會讓皮膚 產生皺縮 反而使它們變短
What's really happening is that dehydration is shrinking your skin, pulling it back.

200
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:31,187
根據這些接發的部位 它們肯定是在生前被加上的
Based on where she put these extensions, they were definitely still alive.

201
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:33,637
我們知道 不明嫌犯沉浸在豐富的幻想
Now,we know this unsub is stuck in a rich fantasy,right?

202
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,137
一個難以置信的詳盡的幻想
An incredibly detailed delusion.

203
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,807
我們不知道她的幻想是什麼 不過肯定涉及到重新塑造這些女性
We don't know what the delusion is, but we know that it involves remaking these women,

204
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:40,057
從給她們下藥時開始 塑造就開始了
And it begins the moment she has them drugged.

205
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:43,417
她把她們麻痹了 就可以為所欲為 為什麼還要殺死她們?
So she has them paralyzed and she can do whatever she wants, why is she killing them?

206
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:44,537
我覺得她不是故意的 
Well,i don't think she means to.

207
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:47,167
大腦就像是一部機器 對刺激產生反應
The brain is a machine designed to respond to stimuli.

208
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:50,737
如果你讓大腦保持清醒 而限制身體活動 機器慢慢壞了 開始掉發
If you keep the brain awake but the body immobile, it breaks down, loses its hair.

209
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,687
兩個月後 機器終於崩潰
After 2 months, it eventually strokes out.

210
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:55,927
所以殺人並非不明嫌犯的目的 只是不幸的副作用
So death isn't this unsub's goal, it's an unfortunate side effect.

211
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:58,427
- 完全正確 - 你們有什麼發現?
- Exactly. - What'd you find out?

212
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,047
Rita Stuart和Stacia Jackson 都是購衣狂
Both rita stuart and stacia jackson were clothes hounds,

213
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:03,477
不過因為她們都身材嬌小 衣服都要做不小的修改
But because they were petite women,they had a lot of their stuff altered.

214
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:05,147
這可能是不明嫌疑犯發現受害人的途徑
Could be how our unsub is finding her victims.

215
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:06,897
她可以親手測量她們的尺寸
She gets her hands on their measurements.

216
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:09,687
可是我們已經排除了裁縫 改衣店 她們沒有交集
But we already exhausted tailors,alteration shops. There's no overlap.

217
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:12,227
裁縫可能會把一些特殊衣服 交給第三方修改
The tailors might send specialty items out to third parties.

218
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:15,947
深入調查全面的僱用記錄 看看有誰可能承接了轉包合同
Dig deep into extended employment records and see who they might be subcontracting to.

219
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:18,737
- Garcia要和我們說話 - 說吧 Garcia
- Garcia needs to talk to us. - Go ahead,garcia.

220
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:21,077
好啊 親愛的們 我已經掃瞄了失蹤人口報告
Hello,my pretties. I have finished my missing persons sweep.

221
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:26,127
沒有發現和醫學有關的車輛 不過有兩個符合這樣穿著的新失蹤女性
I've got nothing on the medical vehicle, but 2 new matches on the clothes make the woman front.

222
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:29,277
Cindy Admundson  她在一家廉價商店前被誘拐了
Cindy admundson.She was abducted outside a thrift store,

223
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:32,437
Maxine Wynan最後被看見 是在Hillridge購物中心
and maxine wynan was last seen at the hillridge mall.

224
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:33,647
這聽起來像我們的受害人
That sounds like our girl.

225
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:35,367
中心埵竟妗蠵像嗎?
Any surveillance footage at the mall?

226
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:38,477
沒有 那是外面的停車位 抱歉
No. It was an outside parking lot. So sorry.

227
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,387
新的被誘拐者 她們的體型如何?
The new abductees-- What's their physical type?

228
00:13:40,397 --> 00:13:43,017
我看起來她們都很嬌小 馬上發送照片過來
They look pretty tiny to me. I'm gonna send you pictures.

229
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,267
如果想取悅法院的話
Also,if it pleases the court,

230
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:47,897
我想請大家注意A號證據 時間順序
I would like to direct your attention to exhibit "a," the calendar map.

231
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,037
怎麼了?
What about it?

232
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,747
這兩位新受害人都是在一周前被誘拐的
Both of these new victims were abducted one week ago,

233
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:57,897
時間在Rita Stuart和Stacia Jackson 的屍體分別出現的前一天
Exactly one day before the bodies of rita stuart and stacia jackson, respectively,turned up.

234
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:00,767
她只有找到了替代者 才會去陳屍
She doesn't let a body go until she has a replacement.

235
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:04,997
非常感謝
Thank you so much.

236
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:20,687
打擾下 需要幫忙嗎?
Excuse me. Do you need some help?

237
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:22,337
噢 這個斜坡壞了
Oh,the ramp's broken.

238
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:23,537
需要我叫輛拖車嗎?
You want me to call a tow truck?

239
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,877
我只要把輪椅放上車就能回家了
I just need to get the chair in the van, and then I can go home.

240
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:29,177
- 我們可以把它放上去 - 你覺得行?
- Well,we could load it. - You think?

241
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:31,147
當然 我們把它放在後面嗎?
Sure. We'll put it in the back?

242
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:34,397
- 你進去吧 你拖 我抬起來 - 好的
- Go on in. You pull,i'll lift. - Ok.

243
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:41,047
1 2 3...
1,2...

244
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:46,507
好了 我們需要鎖上輪子或做什麼嗎?
Here we go. Do we need to lock the wheels or anything like that?

245
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:01,697
你真美
You're so pretty.

246
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:05,937
被害人叫Mary Newsome
Victim is mary newsome.

247
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:07,677
兩個月前被誘拐的
Abducted 2 months ago.

248
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:11,187
她今天一早在長椅上被發現的
She was found on this bench first thing this morning.

249
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:14,877
這看起來像她的風格 這是雪紡綢 而且縫得很合身
Ok,well,it looks like her style. It's chiffon, and it's sewn to fit.

250
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:18,207
如果她處置了這具屍體 就意味著她最近抓了一個新受害者
If she's disposed of this body, it means she's recently taken a new victim.

251
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,867
我們聯繫Hotch  需要梳理最近48小時內的失蹤報告
We'll call hotch, we'll comb through missing persons reports from the last 48 hours.

252
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,257
- 我去調出來 - 謝謝
- I'll pulling them. - Thank you.

253
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:29,077
什麼?
What?

254
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:31,087
這些不是接發
These aren't hair extensions.

255
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:34,777
- 也許她的頭髮太易斷裂了 - 也許吧 我不知道
- Maybe her hair was too brittle. - Maybe. I don't know.

256
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:38,277
你知道嗎? 這是假髮 我想是卡尼卡龍(一種難燃纖維)
You know what? This is a wig. Kanekalon,i think.

257
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:41,117
- 那是什麼? - 人造發 沒有什麼特別的
- What's that? - Uh,synthetic hair. There's nothing special about it.

258
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:45,417
它被廣泛用於全世界假髮的製造 不過看這
It's used in wigs all over the world. But look at this.

259
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:49,667
是縫上去的?
O are those stitches?

260
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,837
縫在她頭皮上
On her scalp.

261
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,617
她把假髮縫上去的
She sewed this in.

262
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:06,497
好的 Wallace 我知道了 謝謝
Yeah. Wallace. I got it. Thank you.

263
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:09,507
嗨 我想我知道誰昨晚被帶走了
Hey,i think we found who was taken last night.

264
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:11,757
她的名字是Bethany Wallace
Her name is bethany wallace.

265
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,877
她丈夫說她沒有從乾洗店回來
Her husband says she never came home from the dry cleaners

266
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,727
她在那堸惜U取了衣服
where she stopped off to pick up some clothes.

267
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,197
店堛漱H看見什麼了嗎?
Anybody at the cleaners see anything?

268
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:18,437
店員正忙著關店
The employees were busy locking up.

269
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:21,367
不過他們提到轉讓了部分工作 給一些在家工作的裁縫
But they did mention that they do farm out work to tailors who work from home.

270
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:23,947
好的 我們可以查看誰接了Bethany的衣服
Good. We can match records based on who worked on bethany's clothes.

271
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:27,107
我們剛從Garcia那兒收到 最近兩個被拐者的照片
We just got the pictures of the 2 recent abductions from garcia.

272
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,607
把新受害人的照片放在 被她們替換的屍體旁
Line up the photos of the new victims next to the bodies they replaced.

273
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:31,997
也許對我們整理時間線有幫助
That might help us with the timeline.

274
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:46,837
- 你們發現了嗎? - 嗯
- You guys see this? - Yeah.

275
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,067
她讓受害者們在形態上 一個個匹配起來
She's matching up the victims physically one to one.

276
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:50,767
她是個收藏者
She's a collector.

277
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,277
我們可以給出側寫了
We're ready to give the profile.

278
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,807
我們要找的不明嫌犯是女性
The unsub we're looking for is a woman.

279
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:59,177
她是個收藏者  在精神病理學上接近於貯藏
She's a collector. It's a psychopathology similar to hoarding.

280
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:02,607
我們所說的收藏者  不是指收藏郵票或籃球卡
So when we say collector, we're not talking about stamps or baseball cards.

281
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:07,137
不是你們的孩子 甚至你們 會追求的普通愛好
It's not what your kids, or even you, might pursue as a normal hobby.

282
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,967
這是一種對事物的愛慕 演變成迷戀
This is an attachment to objects that's become obsessive,

283
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:13,437
出現在一些反社會和極端內向的人身上
By someone who is antisocial and extremely introverted.

284
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:17,417
這些人把自己的一部分 依附於他們的收藏
These people attach a part of themselves to their collection.

285
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:20,257
如果你試圖把他們分開 或者拿走他們的收藏
If you try to separate them from it or take it away from them,

286
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:23,017
他們會強烈反抗 甚至像精神病人一樣
They will react violently, even psychotically.

287
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,207
他們的大腦額葉前部皮層受到了損傷
They've suffered damage to their prefrontal cortex.

288
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:28,637
這是大腦用來控制弗洛伊德式的 幻想和現實的部分
That's the part of the brain that regulates basic freudian fantasy/reality.

289
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:32,547
他們仍有行為能力 例如駕駛汽車 工作 甚至納稅
They can still function, like drive a car, go to work, even do their taxes.

290
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:37,397
事實上 她擅長有明確目標的工作 比如精細的縫紉
In fact,she excels at goal-oriented jobs, like the precision of sewing.

291
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:38,977
或者安排誘拐的細節
Or the details of abduction.

292
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,727
但他們已經沒有能力辨別生死
But they've lost their ability to categorize the difference between living and dead,

293
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:46,287
也無法辨別擁有和失去 那種能力已經喪失 無法挽回
uh,belonging and loss. That has been irreparably destroyed.

294
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:48,307
那她收集什麼呢 女人?
So,what's she collecting,women?

295
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,557
事實上 她以為她在收集娃娃
Actually, we think she's collecting dolls.

296
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:53,147
嚴格說來 是置換他們
Technically, replacing them.

297
00:18:53,187 --> 00:18:56,977
我們認為她在最近的三個月 失去了最初的娃娃
We believe that she lost the originals sometime within the last 3 months,

298
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:59,507
這成為了她的應激來源
And this is what served as her stressor.

299
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,927
她開始尋找替代物 但發現找不到
She searched for a replacement, and when she couldn't find them,

300
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:05,337
就開始誘拐最為接近的替代品
She started abducting the closest possible surrogate.

301
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:09,277
不同種族 但體態相近的女性
Women of different ethnicities but of similar physicality.

302
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:12,437
注射藥物致受害人麻痹 也是她幻想的一部分
The drug-induced paralysis is part of the fantasy.

303
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,937
她將受害人置於無法回話的境地
She puts her victims in a position where they can't talk back

304
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,907
便可以像膜拜丟失的物品一樣 去膜拜受害人
So she can fetishize them like the objects she's lost.

305
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:20,557
這樣
Look.

306
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:24,967
我尊重你們的分析 但這個女人 綁架了6名女性 殺害了其中3人
I respect your analysis, but this woman kidnapped 6 women and killed 3 of them.

307
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,347
你們卻說 全都是因為娃娃?
And you're telling us this is about dolls?

308
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:31,587
最近的一名受害者 不明嫌犯在她頭皮上縫了假髮
This unsub stitched a wig onto the scalp of her latest victim.

309
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:34,817
這是給瓷娃娃添置頭髮的技術
It's a technique used to attach hair to porcelain dolls.

310
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:38,467
要記住 收藏者和連環殺手 也有共同之處
And keep in mind, collectors and serial killers do share certain traits.

311
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,367
許多連環殺手都會拿走物件 作為戰利品
A lot of serial killers take trophies,

312
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:43,987
他們對戰利品的強烈認同 與這名收藏者對收藏品的認同是一樣的
Attaching the same significance to them that this collector does to objects.

313
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,257
但這個不明嫌犯 並非出於暴力目的
But this unsub's intent isn't violence.

314
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:50,797
她希望能完整自己的收藏 使得自己能掌控生活
She needs this collection to be complete so she can feel in control of her life,

315
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:54,267
也許是經歷了什麼創傷 需要治癒
Probably to overcome some trauma she experienced.

316
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:57,447
只有當收藏完整時 她才能有掌控的感覺
She really only feels that control when the collection is complete,

317
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,807
所以她在活著的受害者身上 一次一次地重複綁架的手法
Which is why she's repeating an abduction pattern with living victims.

318
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:01,707
如果失去了一個娃娃 或者在這個案子
If she loses a doll, or in this case,

319
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:05,697
如果失去了一個象徵著娃娃的女人 她就得再找人填上空缺
If she loses a woman who represents a doll, she has to replace it.

320
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:08,747
嫌犯單獨行動 有醫療培訓背景
This woman works alone. We know she has medical training.

321
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:13,467
去查查因為舉止不雅 而遭解雇的助理護士 或者護理員
Look for nurse's aides or orderlies who were fired for a lack of social graces.

322
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,347
她就算在病床邊 也裝不了好人
She can't fake a bedside manner.

323
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:20,127
我們相信 她目前從事服裝裁製工作
We believe she's currently working as a tailor or a seamstress,

324
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:21,757
我們正順著查下去
And we're following those leads now.

325
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,957
一旦任何可疑聯繫 請馬上通知我們
But do let us know if you notice any overlap in your suspect pools.

326
00:20:26,237 --> 00:20:27,237
謝謝
Thank you.

327
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,417
我當然記得Jackson夫人
Of course I remember ms. Jackson.

328
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,327
發生這樣的事 我們都很難過
We were all sad to hear what happened.

329
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:36,467
你們是否外包過裁縫工作? 有別人做過這活兒嗎?
Do you ever farm out tailoring jobs, someone who might have done this?

330
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:39,147
沒有
No.

331
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:42,857
實話跟你說 這麼過時的東西 我們都不會賣
To be perfectly honest, we wouldn't even sell something so dated.

332
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:45,047
讓我看看
Let me take a look.

333
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:52,127
- 這是哪堥茠? - 怎麼說? 看出什麼了嗎?
- Where did you get this? - Why? Did you see something?

334
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:54,087
你看這個雙線鎖縫法
Look at this lockstitch.

335
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:56,107
是方巾的樣式呢
It's a handkerchief pattern.

336
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:59,337
絲綢方巾採用這樣的縫法
You see this on silk-sewn handkerchiefs.

337
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:02,307
這全都是手縫的
And it's all done by hand.

338
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,567
這麼說 這算是她的簽名了? 這對她來說很特別
So this is her signature? This is unique to her.

339
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:07,027
我就縫不出來 用上機器也做不到
I couldn't do it, not even with a machine.

340
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,607
有什麼店家專門從事這樣的手工縫製嗎?
If there someplace that specializes in handcrafted sewing like this?

341
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,907
不過還能告訴你幾句
No. I'll tell you this much, though.

342
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:15,087
她幹這活兒 可是有年頭了
She's been at it a long time.

343
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,047
這個女人... 稱得上藝術家
This woman... Is an artist.

344
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:24,817
Hotch 這位是 Bethany Wallace的丈夫Karl
Hotch,this is bethany wallace's husband karl.

345
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,487
我們帶他來問話
We brought him in for questioning.

346
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:27,727
你們知道我妻子在哪兒嗎?
Do you know where my wife is?

347
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:30,957
- 先生 我們正在全力搜尋 - 不 你們得在24小時內找到她
- We're searching for her,sir. - No. You have to find her in the next 24 hours.

348
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,397
Bethany有糖尿病
Bethany is a diabetic.

349
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:36,547
看 Prentiss探員說 綁架她的 女人受過醫療培訓 所以...
Look,agent prentiss said that the woman who took her has medical training. So...

350
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,577
Bethany能有機會嗎?
Bethany could have a chance?

351
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,997
- 怎麼了?  - 她讓受害者保持在藥物控制狀態下
- What? - She keeps her victims in a drug-induced state.

352
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:46,397
她們不能溝通
They can't communicate.

353
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:51,287
- 這些...這些藥物會不會... - 我們還不知道
- These...These drugs, will they-- - we don't know.

354
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,647
但我們正在竭盡所能
But we're doing everything we can.

355
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:34,607
大伙 這是Sally 好好對她
Everyone, this is sally. Be nice to her.

356
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:04,757
那麼醫生 如果一名糖尿病患者 被用了這些藥物來維持她麻痹
So,doctor, if a diabetic were given this battery of drugs to keep her paralyzed,

357
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:06,737
會有怎樣的反應?
what would the reaction be?

358
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:12,547
糖尿病患者以不同的方式代謝攝入的 所有東西 如食物 飲料 藥物 
Diabetics metabolize everything they consume differently-- Food,drinks,drugs.

359
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:16,267
這些都會不同程度地被分解為血糖
It all gets broken down to blood sugar at varying rates.

360
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:21,857
最有可能的是 這名患者 在被給藥後幾分鐘就僵了 
Most likely, this patient seized up minutes after she was medicated.

361
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:24,577
這麼說她已經死了
So she's already dead.

362
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:30,627
很可能 但...還有另外一種可能
Probably. Although... There is another possibility.

363
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:36,117
Bethany的病情 可能會讓她  比其他受害人更快分解掉那些藥物
Bethany's condition could break down the drugs faster than the other victims.

364
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,067
她可能恢復對身體的控制?
She could regain control of her body?

365
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:41,177
每一個小時 只要她不出現  就表示希望尚存
Every hour that she doesn't turn up is a reason for hope.

366
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:43,167
我們還是快沒時間了
We're still running out of time.

367
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:46,557
就算那些藥物沒害死Bethany 沒胰島素 她也支撐不了多久
If the drugs don't kill bethany, she's not gonna last long without insulin.

368
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:51,237
看 收藏者們都是誠實的好人
Look,collectors are good,honest people.

369
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,917
你喜歡娃娃 是不會把你 當成個怪人或是戀童者的
Just because you enjoy dolls doesn't make you a freak or a pedophile.

370
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:58,147
這點我們尊重 先生 但我們要找的 女人對自己的強迫癥已失去控制能力
We appreciate that,sir, but the woman that we're looking for has lost her ability to control her obsession.

371
00:24:58,157 --> 00:25:02,437
為了重做她小時候有過的一種娃娃 她已經殺死了三名女性
She's killed 3 women trying to recreate a type of doll she had as a child.

372
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:03,777
跟我描述一下那個系列
Describe the line to me.

373
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:07,137
好吧 受害人都符合一個模式 她們都20多歲 並且都很嬌小
Well,there's a pattern to the victims. They're in their 20s, and they're petite.

374
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:10,697
大多數系列的娃娃 都以嬰幼兒形象為中心
Most doll lines revolve around infants.

375
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:12,577
她是讓她們穿得像嬰兒一樣嗎?
Is she dressing them like babies?

376
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:15,707
不 她不是 她們的服裝都是雪紡裙
No,she's not.Their wardrobe consists of chiffon dresses,

377
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:18,267
穿著女性一名金髮一名紅髮 還有一名是黑人
worn by one blond woman, a redhead,and a black woman.

378
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:21,077
那些裙子 她是自己縫嗎?
The dresses--is she sewing them herself?

379
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:25,317
你怎麼知道這一點的?
How did you know that?

380
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:27,847
那是Valois系列
It's the valois line.

381
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:31,987
80年代後期的本地公司
Local company, back in the late eighties.

382
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,757
很可能我們的不明嫌犯 那時候正要進入青春期
Probably when our unsub was prepubescent.

383
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:40,067
是的 他們宣揚女性主義 和多元文化融合
Yeah. They promoted feminism and multiculturalism.

384
00:25:40,077 --> 00:25:44,497
堅強獨立的女孩子們 就算背景不同 也仍然可以成為朋友
Strong,independent girls from different backgrounds who could still be friends.

385
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,517
Reid 待填的出生證明
Reid. Birth certificate to fill out.

386
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:51,267
一張描述她們生活的表格 和一個自己做衣服的工具包
A form to describe their lives. And a kit to sew your own clothes.

387
00:25:51,277 --> 00:25:52,967
JJ說過 她縫東西有年頭了
Jj said she's been at it for a while.

388
00:25:52,997 --> 00:25:55,697
很可能從孩提時代起 她就開始縫紉了
She's probably been sewing since she was a little kid.

389
00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:58,077
等一下 先生 這舉辦的是個什麼比賽?
Wait a minute. Sir,what's this contest that they held?

390
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:01,387
看誰能做出最富創意的娃娃
That was to see who could come up with the most imaginative doll.

391
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:03,837
縫一條裙子 再寫段文字描述她
Sew a dress. Write an essay to describe her.

392
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:07,247
如果你贏了比賽 你的娃娃就會 出現在下一年的系列中
If you won the contest, you'd have your doll featured in next year's line.

393
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:10,727
- 比賽最後肯定沒能圓滿落幕是吧? - 是 是沒有
- I assume that didn't end well,did it? - No,it did not.

394
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,247
這是兒童心理學家用的經典方法
It's a classic tool child psychologists use.

395
00:26:13,677 --> 00:26:15,167
跟我講講關於這些娃娃的故事
Tell me a story with these dolls.

396
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:19,807
當公司收到 帶有幾乎毫不掩飾的 肉體或性虐待意象的短文的時候
When the company got essays with thinly-veiled references to physical or sexual abuse,

397
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:22,707
他們把那些參賽表格 和娃娃都交給了警方
They turned the entry forms and the dolls over to the police.

398
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:24,157
一曝光 這個系列就給毀了
The publicity killed the line.

399
00:26:24,177 --> 00:26:26,387
你說過那公司是本地的 對吧?
You said the company was local,right?

400
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:29,197
他們可能還保留著留作證物的衣服
They might still have the clothes in evidence.

401
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:05,707
短文看得怎麼樣了?
How are the essays going?

402
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:08,257
叫人讀起來實在是非常壓抑
Makes for some pretty depressing reading.

403
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,407
Prentiss倒是挺享受的
Prentiss is having a good time.

404
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:16,087
這些娃娃都像是小小的時間膠囊
These dolls are all like little time capsules,

405
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:19,147
只是80年代時裝 在她們身上可不那麼美好
only the eighties fashion wasn't so kind to them.

406
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:22,117
我很驚訝 居然有這麼多 小女孩知道怎麼做墊肩
I'm surprised how many little girls knew how to make shoulder pads.

407
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:23,237
你那邊查得怎麼樣了?
How's it going on your end?

408
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:26,397
我拿到了一份受害人去找過的
I got a list of vendors the victims went to--

409
00:28:26,427 --> 00:28:28,387
店舖 裁縫 之類的名單...
Tailors,seamstresses, that sort of thing.

410
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:31,887
嘿JJ 你說過什麼方巾褶邊 對吧?
Hey,jj,you said something about a handkerchief hem,right?

411
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:36,867
這跟她給受害人縫的一模一樣
That's exactly like what she sews for her victims.

412
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,907
參賽表上的名字是?
What's the name on the entry?

413
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,957
- Samantha Malcolm - 她在我的名單上
- Samantha malcolm. - She's on my list.

414
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:46,377
等一下 夥計們 我這邊有她的短文 就在這
Wait a minute,guys. I have her essay around here somewhere. Right here.

415
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:50,157
"Sally不喜歡有閃電的房間"
"sally doesn't like the room with the lightning."

416
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,527
不妙啊
That can't be good.

417
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,757
好吧 夥計們 我剛拿到 Samantha Malcolm的醫療記錄
Ok,guys,i just got samantha malcolm's medical records,and...

418
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:57,867
哦 我的上帝 她注定歹命
Oh,my god, she was doomed.

419
00:28:57,897 --> 00:29:01,197
像艾米莉·勃朗特那般"注定" 像莎士比亞那般"注定"
Like emily bronte doomed, like shakespeare doomed,

420
00:29:01,227 --> 00:29:03,777
像星際迷航堛漪鶡蝷眻L一樣"注定" (迅速掛掉的無名大龍套)
Like red-shirted ensign in "star trek" doomed.

421
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:05,047
Garcia 她身上發生過什麼事情?
Garcia, what happened to her?

422
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,357
哦 抱歉 好吧 最初10年 什麼事情也沒有
Oh,uh,sorry,uh, well,for the first 10 years,nothing,

423
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:12,217
而後 她開始接受了 一系列的電擊休克治療
And then she started a battery of electroshock treatments.

424
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:14,767
10歲的時候? 誰會對一個孩子 實施電擊休克治療?
At 10? Who subjects a child to ect?

425
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:17,227
那就是他父親Arthur Malcolm醫生
That would be her father, dr. Arthur malcolm.

426
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:22,087
他經營一家叫"新生活"的面向問題 青少年的 住院式精神療養機構
He runs an inpatient mental health facility for troubled young people called new lives.

427
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,087
起初 Samantha寫的那篇短文 顯現出一些端倪
At first,the essay that samantha wrote raised some flags,

428
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:29,007
但她父親解釋說 治療是為了應對其母親近期的過世
But her father explained that the therapy was to deal with the recent death of her mother.

429
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:32,877
在那之後 他開始給他服用 一系列強效治療精神病的藥物
After that,he started her on a serious regimen of anti-psychotic drugs,

430
00:29:32,907 --> 00:29:35,097
直到幾年前 才給她斷掉
Which he weaned her off of a few years ago.

431
00:29:35,117 --> 00:29:37,057
這就解釋了她對藥物的熟悉
It explains her familiarity with medication.

432
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:38,437
她現在在哪?
Where is she now?

433
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:41,577
呃 她父親宣稱她殘疾(生活無法自理) 所以 他仍然是她的法定監護人
Uh,her father declared her incompetent, so he's still the legal guardian.

434
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:43,047
所有的一切都在他的名下
Everything is in his name.

435
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,847
而她所有的資料上 都填著她住在"新生活"
And all of her records list new lives as her residence.

436
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:50,667
她又不能把受害人關在 一家療養院 她需要獨處
She couldn't keep victims in an inpatient facility. She needs privacy.

437
00:29:50,677 --> 00:29:53,387
Garcia 以他父親名義 所持有的房產呢?
Garcia,what about real estate holdings in her father's name?

438
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:58,947
只有他自己家  但"新生活"有不少 門診處和過渡中心 遍佈鎮上各處
Just his own. But new lives has a bunch of outpatient and halfway houses all over town.

439
00:29:58,957 --> 00:30:00,147
JJ 她在哪堣u作?
Jj,where does she work?

440
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:02,437
我這埵釵o在鎮上三處 不同店舖的地址
I have her placed at 3 different shops around town.

441
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,137
好吧 我們分頭去店舖跟療養院
All right, let's split up and cover the shops and the facility.

442
00:30:05,157 --> 00:30:07,597
我想去"新生活" 不管她在不在那  我都去 我想和她父親談談
I want to go to new lives. Whether or not she's there, I want to talk to the father.

443
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:10,377
不誇張地說 有上百種療法 可用來幫助孩子走出迷惘
There are literally hundreds of therapies to help kids through loss.

444
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,067
電擊休克療法絕不在其中
Electroshock is not one of them.

445
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,077
帶上Rossi
Take rossi.

446
00:30:17,437 --> 00:30:22,067
要好好相處喲 晚點再見
Be nice to each other. See you later.

447
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:54,837
我們走
We're leaving.

448
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:59,817
不...不
No... No.

449
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:58,632
我一頭霧水 先生們
I am very confused, gentlemen.

450
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:00,282
這和Samantha有什麼關係?
What does this have to do with samantha?

451
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,022
我們需要跟她談談 她在這嗎?
We need to talk to her. Is she here?

452
00:33:02,032 --> 00:33:03,532
不 她在上班
No,she's at work.

453
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:06,792
她住這嗎 還是你把她搬到 你的某個過渡中心去了? 
Does she live here, or did you move her into one of your halfway houses?

454
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:08,802
實際上 她住我的一套房子
As a matter of fact, she is in one of my houses.

455
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:10,272
好 我們需要地址
Well,we'll need the address.

456
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:12,302
我得知道這是怎麼了
And i'll need to know what this is about.

457
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:15,762
她可能和一系列綁架事件有關聯
She might be tied to a series of abductions.

458
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:17,462
那不可能 那不是我女兒
That's not possible. It's not my daughter.

459
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:19,642
Samantha是一個人在那棟房子媔?
Is samantha on her own at this house?

460
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:21,932
那堥S有其他患者 對吧?
There are no other patients,right?

461
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:23,752
她覺得那樣最好 而我也同意
She thought that was best, and I agreed.

462
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:24,782
對 但實話說了吧
Yeah, but let's face it--

463
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:27,892
- 你很高興她不再用你操心了 - 你再說一遍?
- you're happy that she's out of your hair. - I beg your pardon?

464
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:32,502
因為 如果你最近去看過她 醫生 你會發現她在做什麼的
Because if you had been visiting her recently, doctor, you would know what she's been doing.

465
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,302
Samantha一直都有問題
Samantha has always been troubled.

466
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:36,142
已經有三名女性因她而死了
3 women are dead because of her.

467
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:38,582
- 她是做不出那樣的事情的 - 你確定嗎?
- She's not capable of that. - Are you certain?

468
00:33:38,592 --> 00:33:42,282
我是說 電擊休克治療的影響 特別是那個年紀 是永久性的
I mean,the effects of electroshock, especially at that age, are permanent.

469
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,302
但也許這些你都知道
But maybe you knew that.

470
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:48,242
Samantha10歲的時候我妻子去世了 她再沒能恢復過來
My wife died when samantha was 10, and she never recovered.

471
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:52,882
任何方法我都試過了兒童精神病療法 寵物療法 沒有一樣對她有幫助
I tried everything. Child psychiatry, pet therapy, nothing helped.

472
00:33:52,892 --> 00:33:55,982
她不停割傷自己 她很痛苦
She was cutting herself. She was in pain.

473
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:58,352
這次會面結束
That's the end of this meeting.

474
00:33:58,372 --> 00:33:59,852
你女兒在哪 醫生?
Where's your daughter, doctor?

475
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:03,742
還有 Rossi探員 如果你在她不明白 自己在做什麼的情況下...
And,agent rossi, if you try to talk to her, a mentally ill woman,

476
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,042
試圖跟她 一位患有 精神疾病的女性說話... 
Without her knowing what she's doing--

477
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:06,662
你知道她禁錮女性的事情嗎?
do you know about the women she's keeping?

478
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:10,192
沒有醫療顧問或律師在場 你是問不出什麼的
And have no medical or legal counsel present, you'll have no case.

479
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:11,232
你明白我說的話嗎? 什麼也問不出
Do you understand me? None.

480
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:15,262
我們會把警力留在這 以防萬一Samantha突然到訪
We'll keep the police here in case samantha drops in for a visit.

481
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:19,152
- 我們走吧Reid - 我簡單問下 為什麼這些玩具會在這?
- Let's go,reid. - Hey,a really fast question. Why are these toys here?

482
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:20,322
我在我的治療中會用到它們
I use them in my therapy.

483
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:22,542
這我明白 但為什麼它們 高高地放在這個架子上 
No,i understand that, but why are they way up on this shelf,

484
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:25,612
放那麼高 小孩子根本夠不到
Away from where any kids can actually reach them?

485
00:34:25,622 --> 00:34:28,412
它們能讓我記起曾經治療過的病人
They're reminders of patients that I've helped.

486
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:33,762
再問一句 你用這個輔助治療的 小女孩 叫什麼名字
Let me ask you something. What was the name of the girl you helped with this one?

487
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:36,752
Jenny Larson
Jenny larson.

488
00:34:36,762 --> 00:34:39,642
那這個呢? 用這個輔助治療的 小女孩 叫什麼名字
And this one? What was the name of the girl you helped with this one?

489
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:42,412
Abigail Moore
Abigail moore.

490
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:44,282
那這一個呢?
How about this one?

491
00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:45,842
Linda Krauss
Linda krauss.

492
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:49,142
這些小女孩都是... 我猜都是9-12歲?
These girls are what, they're like 9--9 or 12 years old,i'm assuming?

493
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:52,772
我博士階段主攻的是 創傷對青春期前女孩的影響
My phd. Is on the effect of trauma on prepubescent girls.

494
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:54,632
你話娷簸w 我可不欣賞
I do not appreciate what you're implying.

495
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:57,502
我沒有什麼言下之意 只是做個推斷
Oh,i'm not implying anything. I'm making an inference.

496
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,122
推斷是有一定依據的猜測
An inference is an educated guess.

497
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:02,202
而在此基礎上 我得出了一個假說
And based on that, I form a hypothesis.

498
00:35:02,222 --> 00:35:06,222
例如 我的假說就是 在你強姦了你女兒之後
For instance, my hypothesis here is that after you raped your daughter,

499
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:09,082
你強迫她接受電擊休克治療 確保她保持緘默
You submitted her to electroshock treatment to make sure she stayed quiet.

500
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:10,442
這太無禮了
This is outrageous.

501
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:15,192
而後 出於內疚 你給她買玩具 更具體地說 你給她買某系列的娃娃
And then,out of guilt, you bought her toys, more specifically, you bought her a line of dolls.

502
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:17,702
因為 連環猥褻犯都會這麼做的 他們給予禮物
Because that's what serial molesters do. They give gifts.

503
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:20,762
於是 你和你的其他病患們 也延續了這個模式
So you continued the pattern with your other patients,

504
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:24,522
而一旦她們不再受你的"照顧" 你就把她們的玩具添到你的收藏 
And once they left your care, you added their toys to your collection.

505
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:27,922
很遺憾 你沒法證實你的故事 博士
I'm sorry,you can't back up your story, doctor.

506
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,652
這就是為什麼我熱愛我的工作 醫生
This is why I love my job,doctor.

507
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:32,832
因為我的實驗室 就是審你的法庭
Because my lab, it's a jury of your peers.

508
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:36,882
我的實驗將會是Jenny Larson Abigail Moore還有Linda Krauss
My tests will be jenny larson, abigail moore, and linda krauss.

509
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:40,252
地檢會讓她們出庭作供 而我會親自把這些娃娃拿上庭
The d.a.will put them on the stand, and I'm  going to personally bring these dolls in,

510
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:42,552
我們倒要看看 她們作何反應
And we're going to watch how they react.

511
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:47,822
或著 你可以告訴我們你女兒在哪 那我們可以告訴地檢 你配合調查
Or you could tell us where your daughter is and we'll tell the d.a.you cooperated.

512
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:52,422
但一旦我們走出這扇門  這交易可以就作廢了
But once we walk out this door, that deal comes off the table.

513
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,302
亞當斯街2529號
2529 adams street.

514
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,612
你會告訴他們的 對吧? 我有配合
You'll tell them,right? That I cooperated.

515
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:15,122
想知道我是怎麼看穿你的嗎?
You want to know how I figured you out?

516
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:19,912
那些玩具 你很小心收藏它們 這些你卻當寶貝珍藏
Those toys. You take care of them. These ones you treasured.

517
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:22,972
但你知道吧? 那些系列並不完整
But you know what? The collection's not complete.

518
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:26,872
它們在哪?
Where are they?

519
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:39,642
她要回來了
She's coming back.

520
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:05,842
我必須得把它再接回去
I have to put it back in.

521
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:08,782
- 不求你了 請別 - 抱歉
- No,please. Please,don't. - I'm sorry.

522
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:22,102
別離開我
Don't leave me.

523
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:27,942
讓我們走
Let us go.

524
00:38:28,902 --> 00:38:31,392
- 我不能 - Samantha?
- I can't. - Samantha?

525
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:36,342
你好 我叫Spencer 我是FBI的
Uh,my name's spencer. I'm with the fbi.

526
00:38:36,822 --> 00:38:38,842
我知道你父親對你做了什麼
I know what your father did to you,

527
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:43,832
而且 我希望你能明白 他以後 永遠 再也不能再傷害你了
and I want you to know that he can never, ever hurt you again.

528
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,882
他從來沒碰過我  他是個好父親 他愛我
He never touched me. He's a good father. He loves me.

529
00:38:48,892 --> 00:38:52,692
我知道 他很可能強迫你說這些話
I know that he probably forced you to say those things,

530
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:57,262
並且如果你說錯 他會懲罰你 把你送到有閃電的房間?
And he punished you if you got it wrong, sent you to the room with the lightning.

531
00:38:58,422 --> 00:38:59,732
是啊
Yeah.

532
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:04,062
你父親在傷害你之後 給你的那些娃娃 它們會怎樣?
The dolls that your father gave you after he hurt you, what would happen to them?

533
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:06,692
他把它們跟其它玩具一起 放在他的辦公室
He kept them in his office with the other toys.

534
00:39:06,702 --> 00:39:08,852
他讓你在那婺禰早怐惕a?
That's where he let you play with them?

535
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:11,602
但當我搬出來的時候  我得帶上我的朋友們
But when I moved out, I had to take my friends with me.

536
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:14,382
我不能丟下它們
I couldn't leave them behind.

537
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:16,782
當然 所以你去接它們 
Of course. And so you went you get them.

538
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:19,922
你找...找到了什麼?
What--what did you find?

539
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:37,872
是啊 他把它們給了另一個女孩 對吧?
Yeah. He gave them to another girl, didn't he?

540
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:41,392
你想要回它們嗎?
Do you want them back?

541
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:44,012
他說我不能  他說 送走它們是有好處的
He said I couldn't. He said they were gone for good.

542
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:46,162
他說謊了 他說謊很長時間了
He lied. He's been lying to you for a long time.

543
00:39:46,172 --> 00:39:48,262
你想見它們嗎?
Do you want to see them?

544
00:39:48,912 --> 00:39:52,812
- 我可以嗎? - 可以 可以 你想跟它們玩嗎?
- Can i? - Yeah. Yeah,do you want to play with them?

545
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:08,342
安全 我們這婸搨n醫護支援
Clear. We need medical here.

546
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:17,472
等下 等一下 嘿Samantha? 聽著
Hold on. Hold on one second. Hey,samantha? Listen.

547
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:22,182
你要跟這個叔叔走 但你的朋友們 也可以跟你一起去好嗎?
You need to go with these men, but your friends can go with you,ok?

548
00:40:22,192 --> 00:40:24,832
他們不會...不會把它們帶走嗎?
They won't take-- they won't take them away?

549
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:28,972
我保證 沒人會再把它們帶走的
I promise no one will ever take them away again.

550
00:41:01,512 --> 00:41:03,492
幹得好 Reid探員
Well done,agent reid.

Thanks.

552

Checkmate in 12.

553
