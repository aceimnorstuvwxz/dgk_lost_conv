1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,090
Drew Drew 別再說了
Drew. Drew,justjust stop.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,830
我明白 所以Allison才會和你在一起
I get it. That's why allison is with you.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,320
老天 我正在解決
Oh,god. I am dealing with it.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,610
Ben!
Ben!

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,380
是你帶走她的 記得嗎?
Well,you took her from me,remember?

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,150
Ben 你怎麼還沒交電費
Ben,i thought you paid the bill.

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,150
你在幹什麼?
What are you doing?

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,150
Ben?
Ben?

9
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,040
再放大 圖像就會變形了
Any closer and the image will distort.

10
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
Jack怎麼樣?
How is jack?

11
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,590
很聰明 是個好孩子 讓我們很欣慰 
He's real smart. Had us in tears. Great kid.

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,330
Haley呢?
Haley?

13
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,180
實話說 我們準備送他們到暫住點
To be honest,we're moving them to a halfway house.

14
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,550
我以為你找到固定住所了
I thought you had found a permanent location.

15
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,720
Haley給她媽媽打了幾個電話
Haley made a number of phone calls to her mother.

16
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,750
問題不大 但安全起見 我們不得不轉移
It's all good, but to be safe, we have to move them.

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,540
Sam 謝謝你
Sam,thank you.

18
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,310
我保證 他們絕不會受到傷害
I promise you, no harm will come to them.

19
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,290
你只要全心對付Foyet
You just concentrate on getting foyet.

20
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,750
生日快樂 夥計
Happy birthday,buddy.

21
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,630
有時間嗎?
You got a second?

22
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,200
什麼事?
Sure,what is it?

23
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,320
有新案子
A case just came in.

24
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,820
我一會就來
I'll be right there.

25
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,410
其實 我有話跟你說
Actually, I need to talk to you.

26
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,440
案子是在長島的康梅克市 你家鄉
It's on commack,long island. That's your home town.

27
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,610
對 要是可以 我想留下來
Yeah. And if it's ok, i'd rather stay behind.

28
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,800
為什麼?
Why?

29
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,680
30年前離開那兒時  我的生活與現在截然不同
It was a different life, one I left 30 years ago.

30
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,970
我還不想回去 這樣...
I'm in no hurry to go back. Well...

31
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,080
要是放在平常 我就答應了 但是看看這個
Any other day, i'd say stay, but I just became aware of this.

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,480
什麼情況?
What have we got?

33
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,040
昨晚Ben Vanderwaal在長島的 康梅克市 被近距離槍殺
Ben vanderwaal was killed in commack,long island, last night, shot at close range,

34
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,100
心臟和頭部各中一槍 .22口徑彈殼
once in the heart, once in the head, . 22 caliber shell.

35
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,490
發現了他妻子Heather的頭髮和血跡
They found hair and blood traces from ben vanderwaal's wife heather.

36
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,330
沒發現Heather?
But not heather?

37
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,560
沒有 她失蹤了 估計已死亡
No,she's still missing, presumed dead.

38
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,430
子彈口徑與位置和前兩位受害者吻合
The caliber and placement of the bullets match that of two previous victims.

39
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,880
第一位 Rita Haslat
The first,rita haslat.

40
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,450
8個月前 她在新澤西州的家堨Ⅹ
8 months ago she went missing from her home in new jersey.

41
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,640
4周後 在垃圾桶箱被發現
4 weeks later,she was found in a trash bin.

42
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,250
她在3周內瘦成了這副樣子?
She went from that to this in under 3 weeks?

43
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,710
絕對是人為故意造成的
She's totally emaciated.

44
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,690
手腕和腳踝上的痕跡 顯示她曾被捆綁的
Ligature marks on her wrists and ankles indicate she was constrained.

45
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,700
心臟和頭部各中一槍  和Vanderwaal相同
One in the heart, one in the headsame as vanderwaal.

46
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,130
聽起來更像是處決
Sounds more like an execution.

47
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,550
為什麼要在Vanderwaal死後 砍掉他的手呢?
Then why cut off vanderwaal's hands postmortem?

48
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,790
第三名受害者呢?
What about the third victim?

49
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,760
Bill Levington 他的體征顯然改變了
Bill levington. His appearance was certainly altered.

50
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,390
他的生殖器不見了
His genitals were missing.

51
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,190
雖然每案具體殘害方法不同 但顯然已出現個性簽名
Though the method of mutilation is different in each crime, clearly there's a signature.

52
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,920
問題是 個性簽名是什麼?
The question is,what?

53
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,050
20分鐘後起飛 這什麼?
Wheelsup in 20 minutes. What's this?

54
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,210
你說你可以出勤了 謊話
You told me you were cleared to travel. You lied.

55
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,260
淘氣哦 不是 我沒有
Naughty boy. Uh,no,i didn't.

56
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,430
我是個博士 所以嚴格說來不算謊話
I am a doctor,so technically, I wasn't a lie.

57
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,220
那是什麼?
What was it,then?

58
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,750
不同意見
Second opinion.

59
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,680
你現在歸我管了
You're my bitch now.

"正義缺少武力是無能
"justice without force is powerless.

62
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,820
武力缺少正義是暴政"
Force without justice is tyrannical."

64
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,490
Ben Vanderwaal的雙手被砍掉了
In the ben vanderwaal case, his hands were taken.

65
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,420
Bill Levington被除去生殖器
Uh,bill levington, his genitals.

66
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,830
只有Rita Haslat在處決前 遭到了飢餓和虐待
Only in the rita haslat case she was starved and tortured, then executed,

67
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,620
而且死後沒有截肢
and there's no sign of postmortem mutilation.

68
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,660
他為什麼要帶走Heather Vanderwaal 而不是簡單地殺了她?
Why would he take heather vanderwaal and not simply kill her?

69
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,700
也許他還沒下手 她還活著
Maybe he hasn't and she's still alive.

70
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,520
目前唯一明確的是作案手法 顯示罪犯注重效率 實用
The only thing concrete is the m.O., which depicts an efficient nononsense murderer.

71
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,840
我們要找出不同殘害行為 對不明疑犯意味著什麼
Well,then we need to figure out what each act of mutilation means to the unsub.

72
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,550
或者是對受害者
Or to the victim.

73
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,190
長島 康梅克市 Vanderwaal 家

74
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,420
發現現場時基本就這樣 沒有強行闖入的痕跡
It's pretty much how we found it. There's no signs of forced entry.

75
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,880
資料上說Heather Vanderwaal 有個女兒 她現在在哪?
It says in the file that heather vanderwaal has a daughter. Where is she?

76
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,360
搬去聖地亞哥和生父一起生活了
She moved to san diego to live with her real father.

77
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,590
Ben和Heather結婚只有幾年
Ben and heather vanderwaal have only been married a couple of years.

78
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,890
Heather進門 放下購物袋  手機 鑰匙 但沒有放下外套
So heather came in, she dropped her shopping bags, her cell phone,and her keys, but not her coat.

79
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,170
她開燈
She turns on the lights.

80
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,300
但沒亮 因為電話和電力都被切斷了
But they didn't work, because the phone and the electricity were cut.

81
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,750
這房間有東西引起了她的注意
Something in this room attracted her attention.

82
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,710
這是什麼?
What is it?

83
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,990
血跡堛漲L子像是相機的三腳架
Marks in the blood look like a camera tripod.

84
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,900
連環殺手 尤其是性施虐狂  經常會拍下他們的殺戮
Serial killers, especially sexual sadists, often document their kill.

85
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,150
不過性施虐者一般會在 受害人活著的時候折磨他們
But sexual sadists usually torture their victims while they're still alive.

86
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,800
至今依然沒有發現衝突的DNA?
You still didn't find any conflicting dna?

87
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,420
沒有 指紋 纖維 什麼都沒有
No. No prints, no fibers,nothing.

88
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,340
沒有人聽見槍聲嗎? 沒
Nobody heard any shots? No.

89
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,840
抱歉
Oh,excuse me.

90
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,350
喂 知道了
Yeah? All right.

91
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,260
半小時發現Heather Vanderwaal 走在大街上
Heather vanderwaal was just found wandering the streets half hour ago.

92
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,900
現在在Brookside綜合醫院
She's at brookside general.

93
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,890
讓JJ過去
Get jj over there.

94
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,680
這麼老練的殺手不會無故留下活口
A killer this sophisticated doesn't leave a living witness without a reason.

95
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,890
Heather 我是Jareau探員
Heather,my name is agent jareau.

96
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,080
我有幾個問題想問你
I have some questions for you.

97
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,240
你回到家 想開燈 但燈沒有亮
So you came home, you tried to turn the lights on, but they didn't work.

98
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,590
接下來你做了什麼?
What did you do next?

99
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,430
我看見光 閃光燈
I saw a light. A flash.

100
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,820
我打開門 Ben在堶 被綁在椅子上
I opened the door, and ben was there, tied to a chair.

101
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,490
我覺得他已經死了
I think he was dead.

102
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,380
然後閃光燈又亮了
There was another flash.

103
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,810
我眼前黑了一陣
It blinded me for a moment.

104
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,500
看見襲擊你的人了嗎? 沒有

他有沒有說什麼? 沒

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,140
什麼聲音?

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,650
鋸東西
Sawing.

109
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,720
我親眼看他切下Ben的手
I watched him cut off ben's hand.

110
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,930
他為什麼不殺了我?
Why didn't he kill me?

111
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,290
抱歉
Excuse me.

找到一些Heather Vanderwaal的資料
We've been getting to know heather vanderwaal.

114
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,250
我說不出她最喜歡披頭士堛瑤 但我知道她過得極其不開心
I can't tell you her favorite beatle, but I can tell you she was living la vida unhappy.

115
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,570
你發現了什麼?

After that,heather cut a check for $5,000 to a place called lewis,bell,& peters 6 days ago.

118

Vanderwaal夫人

之後 你申請和Ben離婚

124
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,670
那個男人放過你是有原因的

125
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,550
我需要知道這兩件事是否有聯繫

幾個月前 我在Ben手機 發現了一張Allison的照片
A few months ago, I found a picture of allison on ben's phone.

127
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,650

她沒有穿衣服
She was naked.

129
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,510
在哪堜蝒? 我不知道

他說是Allison錯發給他的

132
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,910
她原本是想發給她同學的
She meant to send it to another student at her school.

133
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,250
叫性短信
It's called sexting.

134
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,550
Allison怎麼說?
What did allison say?

135
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,490
她說是Ben拍的 但她愛撒謊
She said ben took it, but sheshe lies.

136
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,810
Allison經常撒謊
Allison,she's a liar.

137
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,120
她給我們惹了很多麻煩
She caused us a lot of trouble,you know?

138
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,320
可這件事她沒說謊 對嗎?
She wasn't lying about this, though,was she?

139
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,420
沒有
No.

140
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,160
手的切除手法並不專業
The hand removal is less than surgical.

141
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,620
他用的是普通雙倍齒的鋸子
He used a basic doubletoothed saw.

142
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,050
所以 我們要找的人沒有醫學背景
So,the guy we're looking for has no medical training.

143
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,130
反正不是我這種的
Not the kind i've had.

144
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,470
一槍在心臟 一槍在頭部 近距離射擊
One in the heart, one in the brain,close range.

145
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,700
第二槍就在耳朵後面
The second one was right up behind the ear.

146
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,220
槍擊殘留物呢?
How about gunshot residue?

147
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,190
少的可憐
Surprisingly little.

148
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,620
也許因為殺手用的是.22
Maybe it's because the killer was using a .22

149
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,440
口徑小 殘留物就少
Small caliber,small discharge.

150
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,210
怎麼了?
What is it?

151
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,540
彈道測試結果沒有找到 與子彈匹配的槍支
Ballistics can't match the bullets to a gun.

152
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,500
子彈上沒有膛線痕跡
There were no rifling marks on the bullet.

153
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,630
對此就只有一個解釋
There's only one explanation for that.

154
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,810
要真有人想殺Ben Vanderwaal  那就是Heather的前夫了
Well,if anyone had a motive to kill ben vanderwaal, it was heather's exhusband.

155
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,830
他在聖地亞哥  而且同前兩名受害人沒有聯繫
But he was in san diego, and he has no connection to the other two victims.

156
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,250
David Rossi 終於見到您了
David rossi, we finally get to meet.

157
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,150
我是Gil Hardesty探長  有您來協助真是太榮幸了
Detective gil hardesty. Very,very nice to have you with us.

158
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,830
Morgan 你發現了什麼?
Morgan, what did you find?

159
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,870
所有案子堛.22口徑子彈 都沒有膛線痕跡
In all cases, the . 22 caliber bullets had no rifling marks.

160
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,440
槍管缺少膛線的推動  子彈的速度一定很慢
And without the barrel being rifled, the bullets would have very little velocity.

161
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,350
他需要近距離直接射擊受害人 JJ
He would have to shoot his victim pointblank. Jj.

162
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,590
這人用的是自製手槍 要是知道方法的話
This guy's using a zip gun.Now,if you know what you're doing,

163
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,540
一段水管或者兒童車打氣筒 就能改製成一把槍
a piece of plumbing or a kid's bicycle pump can be turned into a gun.

164
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,310
一槍在心臟 一槍在頭部
One in the heart, one in the head.

165
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,370
子彈無法追蹤 毫無疑問
Untraceable,expandable bullets tell me without question,

166
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,070
這些謀殺絕對是職業手法 職業殺手干的?
all of these kills were strictly business. A hitman?

167
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,870
那些死後截肢怎麼說?
What about the postmortem mutilation?

168
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,450
僱傭協議也可能會有額外要求
A contract sometimes includes extras.

169
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,490
相機為的不是性滿足  而是目標死亡的證據
The camera is not for sexual gratification, it's for proof of death.

170
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,420
那我們要找的是兩個人嗎?
So we could be looking for two people?

171
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,330
有可能 可能更多 抱歉
Maybe. Maybe more. Excuse me.

172
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,990
也許我可以找找舊相識幫忙 不過我要單獨行動
I may be able to hit on some old contacts, but i'll need to do it alone.

173
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,900
相識? 我們會想知道嗎?
Contacts? Do we want to know?

174
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,300
最好別
Best not.

175
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,580
我們5:30才開門
We don't open till 5:30.

176
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,840
我要找那件外套的主人
I'm looking for the owner of that coat.

177
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,440
是嗎?
Is that right?

178
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,990
帶了這個可沒門
Not with that you're not.

179
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,100
去檢查前後門
Check out the front and back.

180
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,110
你是承認是警察 還是把命擱在這兒?
You're either a dead man or a cop. Which one is it?

181
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,460
現在 我只是一個老朋友
Right now i'm just an old friend.

182
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,750
當上聯邦探員那天 你就放棄這權利了
You gave up that right the day you became a fed.

183
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,900
Ray?
Ray?

184
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,760
David
David.

185
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,140
我以為你退休在家寫書呢?
I thought you retired. Writing books?

186
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,110
要我怎麼說呢 Ray?
What can I tell you,ray?

187
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,800
有些習慣是很難改的
Some habits are hard to break.

188
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,600
每天早上我都做這該死的字謎
I try this damn puzzle every morning.

189
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,040
一點也沒進步
Never gets any easier.

190
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,360
"彈坑創造者"
"crater creator."

191
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,430
我有個同事 那小子5分鐘就能解決
you know, I work with a kid who can solve this whole thing in 5 minutes.

192
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
他肯定比咱倆加起來都聰明
He must be smarter than both of us.

193
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,910
那是肯定的
That's for sure.

194
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,480
多久沒見了 30年? 33年
So what's it been, 30 years? 33.

195
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,090
我還以為 最不濟也能在 Emma的葬禮上看到你
You know,i thought at the very least I would see you at emma's funeral.

196
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,100
我...想請你幫個忙
I,um... Need to ask you a favor.

197
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,020
她愛的並不比你少
She loved you as much as you loved her.

198
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,910
野心真是害人不淺 是吧?
Hey,ambition's a bitch, ain't it?

199
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,650
我不是來和你聊Emma的
I'm not here to talk about emma.

200
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,270
那你來這幹嘛?
What are you here to talk about?

201
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,180
新聞你看了? 你覺得我和那事有關?
You've read the news? You think I got something to do with that?

202
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,400
你還是老老實實寫書吧
You should stick to writing books.

203
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,930
兇手手法很有特點
This guy is real specific.

204
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,620
用自製小手槍殺人 再附帶折磨
He uses a zip gun and then throws in extras.

205
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,340
你是個聰明人 回這來太蠢了
For a smart guy, your coming back here was a real dumb move.

206
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,110
那Sean不就更蠢了
Not as dumb as the one that sean made.

207
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,890
他因為運輸軍火受審 無疑是你的替罪羊
He's on trial for the transportation of weapons, no doubt for you.

208
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,930
還有你那詐騙腐敗組織集團犯罪呢?
And what about the rico beef hanging over your head?

209
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,790
你幫了我 就等於協助聯邦調查
You help me, and you'll be assisting a federal investigation.

210
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,110
那就能讓我的名聲好起來了?
And what exactly is that gonna do for my reputation?

211
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,800
如果你不幫 可就沒名聲可言了
If you don't, you may not have one to protect.

212
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,560
我們集團犯罪部門 就快讓你永遠歇業了
Our organized crime unit is very close to shutting you down permanently.

213
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,850
繼續說
Keep talking.

214
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,490
鋸斷手臂和Rita Haslat被發現時 的情況一樣目的明確
The removal of the hands is as specific as rita haslat's condition was when she was found.

215
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,260
和Bill Levington生殖器被割除也一樣
Just as specific as the removal of bill levington's genitals.

216
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,100
不明嫌犯想利用切除傳達某種訊息
There's a message in the mutilations the unsub wants us to know.

217
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,780
我這兒有點東西可能有用
I got something here that might help us with

218
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,310
嚴格來說 是我們有點東西可能有用
technically,we have something here that might help with that.

219
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,490
Bill Levington參與多宗強姦案  均涉及未成年人 但從未受審
Bill levington was involved in a serial rape case, all involving minors, and it never went to trial.

220
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,390
Rita Haslat呢?
Rita haslat?

221
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,530
以前是社工
A former social worker,

222
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,380
因為重大失職 被兒童與家庭服務部門解雇
attained said former status when she was fired from the dcfs for gross negligence.

223
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,750
她經手的一個案例中 一名七歲男童被餓死
In one of her cases, a 7yearold boy starved to death.

224
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,010
也就解釋了Haslat被發現時 為什麼那麼消瘦
Which explains why haslat was so emaciated when she was found.

225
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,730
所有受害者都涉及兒童案件的話 我們就找到聯繫了
If all the victims were indicated in crimes against children, then we've found a connection.

226
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,560
不明嫌犯能知曉受害人的罪行  可能從事司法行業
One of the unsubs has access to the crimes of the victims and probably works in the justice system.

227
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,630
Garcia? 這就查
Garcia? On it.

228
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,730
好了 我們發現受害人的共同點了
All right,well, we know what the victims have in common,

229
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,170
只需找出與他們都有聯繫的人
we just need to find out who they have in common.

230
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,140
等等 社工和涉嫌強姦案是有記錄的
Wait. This social worker and the suspected rape case, those were matters of record.

231
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,130
Ben Vanderwaal和她繼女的事可沒有
Ben vanderwaal's relationship with his stepdaughter is not.

232
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,080
除非那個女孩告訴了別人
Unless the stepdaughter told someone else.

233
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,090
我打給Rossi
I'll call rossi.

234
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,760
我把那女孩帶過來
I'll have the daughter brought in.

235
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,790
三個案子都涉及兒童?
And all 3 crimes were against children?

236
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,140
好 謝謝了 Prentiss
Ok. Thanks,prentiss.

237
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,850
古巴的 毫無疑問
Cuban,no doubt.

238
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,610
走私貨?
Contraband?

239
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,570
有些法律就是不公正的
Some laws are just plain unjust.

240
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,400
那三個人都傷害過小孩
You know,those 3 individuals messed with kids.

241
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,680
完全是罪有應得
They got what they deserve.

242
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,750
那得看你怎麼定義公正了
That all depends on your definition of justice.

243
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,540
跟咱年輕時一樣
It's the same as when we were kids.

244
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,810
為了生存 就得不擇手段
You do what you gotta do to survive.

245
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,090
那這個人呢?
What about this guy?

246
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,410
這手法只能出自一個人
Yeah. There's only one guy that's this specific.

247
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,390
誰?
Name?

248
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,330
Bosola
Bosola.

249
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,340
我昨晚跟Heather通過話
I spoke to heather last night.

250
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,720
我早知道有事不對勁 可這也...你怎麼不告訴我呢?
I knew for a long time something was off,but thiswhy didn't you tell me?

251
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,540
Sandweiss先生 Allison可是受害者
Mr. Sandweiss, allison is the victim here.

252
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,580
我只想讓她告訴我事實 哪怕就一次
I just want to know the truth from her, for once.

253
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,280
我說了 我不知道他們在說什麼
I told you, I don't know what they're talking about.

254
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,560
Allison 我們有你繼父給你拍的照片
Allison,we have the pictures your stepfather took of you.

255
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,610
Allison...
Allison...

256
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,880
他總是比媽媽早到家
He was always home before mom.

257
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,130
一開始我們只是說說話
We just talked at first.

258
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,180
為什麼不和你媽媽說?
Why didn't you tell your mom?

259
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,010
我知道她會告訴爸爸  他總說誰要敢碰我就宰了誰
I knew she'd tell dad, and he always said he'd kill anyone who laid a hand on me.

260
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,890
他碰你了嗎?
And did he?

261
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,360
他幹這行多久了?
How long has he been operating?

262
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,100
20年了 他神出鬼沒的 
20 years. He's a ghost.

263
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,840
我聽過這名字 Bosola
I've heard that name. Bosola.

264
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,220
是一齣戲劇堛漕丹
He's a character in a play.

265
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,180
詹姆斯時期悲劇 瑪爾菲女公爵
Jacobean tragedy called the duchess of malfi.

266
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,950
Bosola殘忍地殺害了女公爵
Bosola brutally slays the duchess.

267
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,130
不然就不能稱其為悲劇了
It wouldn't be a tragedy if he didn't.

268
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,750
本地人?
Is he local?

269
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,410
我不在乎什麼集團犯罪案
I don't care about the rico beef.

270
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,710
Sean會怎麼樣?
What about sean?

271
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,400
聯邦監獄 兩年
Federal prison,out in 2.

272
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,550
好吧
All right.

273
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,470
今晚我帶Bosola來
I'll bring you bosola tonight.

274
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,200
你最好帶海軍陸戰隊過來
You better bring the marine corps.

275
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,530
Allison 你有沒有和別人 說過你繼父的事?
Allison,did you ever tell anyone about what your stepfather was doing?

276
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,930
我和治療醫師說過
I told my therapist.

277
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,350
他說我是為了引起注意
He said I act out because I crave attention.

278
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,550
對不起 爸爸
I'm so sorry,daddy.

279
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,840
你沒有做錯什麼
You have nothing to be sorry for.

280
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,200
我們想知道他是誰 你的治療醫師
We need his name, please. Your therapist.

281
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,710
Jerry Sorum
Jerry sorum.

282
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,020
我是犯罪嫌疑人?
Am I a suspect?

283
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,540
還不是 Sorum先生
Not yet,mr. Sorum.

284
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,800
你給Allison的專業看法是什麼?
What is your professional opinion of allison?

285
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,450
你指繼父是否性虐待她? 毫無疑問
You mean was she sexually abused by her stepfather? No question.

286
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,860
你上報了? 是的
And you reported it. Of course.

287
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,510
上報給警方? 當然了
To the police? Absolutely.

288
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,420
他們怎麼處理的?
How far did they take it?

289
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,160
按州法律審核了
They had it reviewed by the state.

290
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,600
警方給她錄口供了嗎?
Did the police interview her?

291
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,630
他們來過我的辦公室 Allison不想扯上關係 案子就結了 
They came to my office. Allison wanted nothing to do with it. Case closed.

292
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,950
就跟國家每年380,000例 上報的虐待兒童案件一樣
Just like the 380,000 cases of child abuse reported in this country each year.

293
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,080
只有不到百分之一能開庭審判
Less than one percent gets to trial.

294
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,840
是不是讓你很想討回公道?
Does that make you want to even the odds?

295
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,520
每當聽孩子重述 都感覺那麼逼真
Every time I listen to a child vividly recount the most horrific acts of abuse

296
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,230
聽到他們本可信賴的人 父親 叔叔...
done at the hands of a father, an uncle,

297
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,510
對他們可怕的所作所為
someone they're supposed to trust...

298
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,500
我所能做的就是不讓自己崩潰
It's all I can do not to break down.

299
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,260
我也只能做到這樣
But that's all i'm capable of.

300
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,440
然後就只有依靠司法系統 像你一樣 
After that,like you, I trust in the justice system.

301
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,770
Rossi 午夜 我的餐館見
Rossi. Midnight. My restaurant.

302
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,000
大多數人從來沒見過Bosola
Most people never meet bosola.

303
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,570
見過的也沒命見第二次
Those that do only ever meet him once.

304
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,330
如果被他察覺你是條子  我就和瑪爾菲女公爵一個下場了
If he smells a fed, i'm gonna end up like the duchess.

305
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,720
那就真的是悲劇了
Now,that would be a tragedy.

306
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,250
我從來沒說過不得體的話 對吧?
I've never said anything out of turn,ever,have i?

307
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,720
繼續
Go on.

308
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,240
您一直待我像親生兒子一樣
Always you've treated me like a son.

309
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,170
但我寧可坐牢 也不願你幫聯邦警察

310
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,570
今晚店堨薿
I'm closing the restaurant tonight.

311
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,190
你和其他人都休息
You and the boys take the night off.

312
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
我不能讓你一個人去幹
I can't let you do this alone.

313
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,010
我不是在幫警察
I'm not helping the feds.

314
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
我是幫一個老朋友
I'm helping an old friend.

315
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,900
晚安 下班吧
Good night. Go on.

316
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,530
燈光一暗 我們就進去
He dims the lights, we go in.

317
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,680
Jack今天四歲了? 是啊
So,uh,jack's what, 4 today? Yeah.

318
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,330
而我卻完全不知他身在何處
And I literally have no idea where he is.

319
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,870
他在安全的地方
He's safe.

320
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:02,490
我看到Prentiss和Morgan開走了  但車堥漕潃荓揚不是我們的人
I saw prentiss and morgan up the block, but the two agents in the sedan, they're not with us.

321
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,030
那是反監視人員 以防Foyet在監視我 
That the counter surveillance in case foyet is watching me.

322
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,200
顯然 局婺g費短缺
For which,apparently, there's no more money.

323
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,690
是啊 我聽說了
Yeah,i heard.

324
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,460
有人給你打電話了?
Did somebody call you?

325
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,320
他們很關心 你怎麼說的?
They're concerned. What did you say?

326
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,570
跟我對你說的一樣  針對你就是針對我們大家
What i'm telling you. An attack against you is an attack against all of us.

327
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,090
你怎麼打來了? 沒事吧?
Why are you calling? You ok?

328
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,780
我希望你們外面的人能靠得住
I hope you got some good guys out there.

329
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,400
這傢伙可不是吃素的
This man is a mean son of a bitch.

330
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,600
我們都準備好了 他不會發覺的
We're all over. He's not gonna know what hit him.

331
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,820
那個孩子...很聰明的那個 能幫我個小忙嗎?
Hey,that kidthe,uh,smart oneI could use a little help.

332
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,760
Reid? Reid在
Reid? Reid here.

333
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,630
填字問題 五個字的 彈坑創造者
Crossword question. 10 letters. Crater creator.

334
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,850
五個字 彈坑創造者
10 letters, crater creator.

335
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,730
反正切函數
Arctangent.

336
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,400
聽見了嗎? 這姑娘真他媽聰明
Did you get that? Damn,she's smart.

337
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,920
你看到閃光了嗎?
Did you see thatflash?

338
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,020
看到了 他已經進去了
I saw that. He's already in there.

339
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,340
所有單位 上 上 上!
All units,go,go,go!

340
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,030
Morgan在外面巡查
Morgan's out canvassing the area.

341
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,570
整個地方都是警察
This whole place is swarming with cops.

342
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,750
我們掌控了街道 大樓 甚至屋頂
We had the streets, the building,even the damn roof covered.

343
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,210
他到底是怎麼躲過我們的?
How the hell did he get through us?

344
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,610
Garcia正在追查Finnegan的電話
Garcia traced finnegan's phone calls.

345
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:13,450
4:38時他打過一個預付電話  另一個就是11:41打給你的
He made one at 4:38 to a prepaid cell, another one to you at 11:41.

346
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,170
我們給了Bosola七個小時作準備
We gave bosola 7 hours to prepare.

347
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,830
我想他在我們之前就到了
I think he was here before we arrived.

348
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,450
然後他聽見Ray給我打電話  這都是我的錯
And he heard ray call me. This is all my fault.

349
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,630
現在他知道我們盯上他了 不只他知道了
Now he knows we're onto him. He's not the only one.

350
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,500
雇他的人也知道了
Whoever he works for does,too.

351
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,900
不明犯認為三位受害者犯下罪行 並以相應方式進行殘害
Each mutilation represents the crimes the unsubs believe these 3 individuals committed.

352
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,640
不明犯? 就是不明犯罪嫌疑人
Unsubs? Unknown subjects.

353
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,790
二人都為男性 不明犯甲  我們稱之為策劃者
2. Both male. Unsub "a" we're calling the planner.

354
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,990
他是刑事司法系統的工作人員
He works in the criminal justice system.

355
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,440
我們要找的可能是辯護律師 檢查官  法官 警察也有可能
We're looking at both defense and prosecution attorneys, judges,and even cops.

356
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,160
我們相信策劃者剛遭受重大生活挫折
We believe that the planner has experienced a devastating personal tragedy of some sort.

357
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,460
而且鑒於案情的複雜性
And because of the sophisticated nature of the scenario,

358
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,470
我們認為不名犯甲年齡在50到60歲
we believe unsub "a" is in his late 50s or 60s.

359
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,040
策劃者與實施者不明犯乙 很可能是通過司法系統認識的
The planner likely met unsub "b",the enforcer, within the court system.

360
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,720
後者被僱傭替天行道
He's been hired to carry out justice.

361
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,780
考慮僱傭價格不菲
Now,this type of justice does not come cheap.

362
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,950
策劃者應該有能力調動大量現金
So the planner has access to substantial cash.

363
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,250
他們未曾嘗試掩蓋截肢事實
Absolutely no attempt was made to hide the mutilation.

364
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,740
這表明策劃者要麼不在乎我們發現 要麼就是想讓我們發現
This suggests the planner either doesn't care what we find or he wants us to find it.

365
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,850
但是實施者就沒有這個用意了
Now,the enforcer, on the other hand, has no such intentions.

366
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,140
他應該是個全副武裝 且極度危險的人物
He should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.

367
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,180
多謝配合 好 幹活吧 大伙
Thank you. All right. Let's go,people.

368
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,120
最後幾筆酬勞已經打到你戶頭
All final payments have been made.

369
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,910
你好好完成任務 不必多問 
I see no reason not to complete the tasks or to converse further.

370
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,810
很好 最後一個目標
Good.One last request

371
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,130
我希望你特別留意下Patton先生
I would like you to pay special attention to mr. Patton.

372
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,100
我在重點調查最近三個案子
I've concentrated on the last 3 cases.

373
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,350
有最新的檔案資料 很好
They've left the freshest eprints. Great.

374
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,900
不見得 長島法院經手的案子超過10萬
Not really. Over 100,000 cases pass through long island court.

375
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,260
都有誰看過那些資料?
Who had eyes on those files?

376
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,130
絕對數以千計了
Literally hundreds and hundreds of people.

377
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,050
那就改變策略 重點放在實施者身上
Change track. Focus on the enforcer.

378
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,170
長島過去十年中 涉及搶劫的謀殺審判
Mobrelated murder trials on long island the last 10 years.

379
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,520
我們找的是個職業殺手
We're looking for a hitman.

380
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,490
過去十年審理過93起搶劫案
Hey,there are 93 mob trials in the last 10 years.

381
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,690
被判有罪的都略過
Put aside any trials that resulted in a conviction.

382
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,360
找出未決審判和提訊案件
Weed out mistrials and arraignments.

383
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,940
還有19起
Uh,19.

384
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,120
那些案件的嫌疑人有沒有 是職業殺手或黑道打手的?
Were any of those on trial suspected of being hitmen or enforcers?

385
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,900
有3起 哇 哇 這個絕對是僥倖漏網
3whoa,whoa,whoa, this totally slipped the net.

386
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,730
Tony Mecacci 未決審判 但看看受害者
Tony mecaccihis case was judged a mistrial, but check out his suspected victim.

387
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,500
是.22口徑的吧? 一語中的
.22 caliber,right? Bull'seye.

388
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,180
交叉比對策劃者側寫和 這起審判所有相關人員
Crossmatch our profile of the planner against all those connected with this trial.

389
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,610
有公訴律師Garrett Daniels 法官Boyd Schuller 辯護律師Paul...
Let's seeprosecuting lawyer garrett daniels, judge boyd schuller, criminal defense lawyer paul

390
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:03,530
等等 你說有Schuller法官?
wait,wait. Did you say judge schuller?

391
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,420
對 這還有照片 怎麼了?
Yeah,here's a photo. What's wrong?

392
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,390
你認識他? 不認識 可他妻子我認識
Do you know him? No. But I knew his wife.

393
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,850
兩年前她下班開車回家  被一個酒後駕駛的司機撞死
2 years ago she was driving home from work and she was killed by a drunk driver.

394
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,240
這能算是重大挫折了
That could be the tragedy.

395
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,020
她是他畢生之愛 這可以肯定
She was the love of his life, that's for sure.

396
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,670
一年前 Schuller法官以健康為由離職
12 months ago,judge schuller took a leave of absence due to health issues.

397
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,780
他被診斷為癌癥晚期 還有六個月時間
He was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He has 6 months to live.

398
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,920
命案就是這時開始的
And that's when the killing started.

399
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,910
你不會真的認為法官... 是的 Schuller法官就是策劃者
You don't seriously think judgejudge schuller is the planner.Yes,i do.

400
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,300
符合側寫
Fits the profile.

401
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,430
Tony Mecacci很可能是殺手Bosola Bosola的資料都有什麼
And tony mecacci is most likely bosola the enforcer. What have you got on bosola?

402
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,580
最後一次審訊後銷聲匿跡
Uh,wofthe grid after his last trial.

403
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,090
JJ 發佈州境通告 向媒體公開Mecacci的照片
Jj,put out a statewide apb and release mecacci's photo to the media.

404
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,780
Schuller法官深受尊重
Judge schuller's a highlyrespected man.

405
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,110
我們不能就這麼抓他 說他是連環殺人犯
We can't just walk in there and accuse him of serial murder.

406
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,050
有必要的話 我就去找檢察長 並向首席大法官提出要求
Then i'll go to the attorney general and petition the chief justice if I have to.

407
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,520
也許不用
And maybe not.

408
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,120
我想你們在找我
I believe you're looking for me.

409
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,880
我們得聲明你所享有的權利
You know we have to advise you of your rights.

410
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,270
本人自證其罪 放棄憲法權利
I waive my constitutional rights against selfincrimination.

411
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,430
你進來時說"我想你們在找我"
When you walked in here, you said,"i believe you're looking for me."

412
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,710
我說得沒錯 時機把握天衣無縫
and I was right. Your timing was impeccable.

413
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,970
但你怎麼知道呢?
But how could you know that?

414
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,650
我知道你們不久就能找到我
I knew it wouldn't take you long to find me.

415
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,850
尤其我犯下這麼多罪
Not after what i've left behind.

416
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,000
那你不否認這一切?
So you don't deny any of this?

417
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,910
為什麼要否認? 你覺得是犯罪 我覺得是在伸張正義
Why would i? What you see as a crime, I see as justice.

418
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,280
Ray Finnegan是我的一個朋友
Ray finnegan was a friend of mine.

419
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,160
他是個罪犯
Ray finnegan was a criminal.

420
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,790
你交友應該更慎重些
You should choose your friends more wisely.

421
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,280
Ray出現在Emma的葬禮上 一定讓你很不安吧
It must have really thrown you when ray showed up at emma's funeral.

422
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,430
你怎麼知道我妻子的?
How do you know about my wife?

423
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,900
你還真不知道我是誰 是嗎?
You have absolutely no idea who I am,do you?

424
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,950
Ray告訴Rossi 只能見Bosola一次
Ray told rossi you only meet bosola once.

425
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,220
所以Schuller法官肯定給他名單了
So judge schuller had to have given him a list of names.

426
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,850
他無需跟他再見面 只要確信死亡後付錢就行了
He never needs to see him again, just make final payment on proof of death.

427
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,260
讓Garcia在一切沒結束前 黑進他的文檔 追蹤財務記錄
Have garcia hack into schuller's files and track his financial records before everything gets shut down.

428
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,270
查清楚他那方是否打過電話
And find out if his office made any calls.

429
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,120
打了 我幾小時跟他們通過話 告訴他們有兩名嫌疑人
They did. I spoke to them a few hours ago. I told them we had two suspects.

430
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,820
那他知道我們在查他了
So he knows we're onto him.

431
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,360
他是來拖延時間的
He came here to stall.

432
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,900
他的確有名單 還有受害者
He does have a list. There's more to come.

433
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,190
咱們接著說我來這的正事吧 怎麼?
Could we just get on with what I came here for? Why?

434
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,020
那樣Bosola就能繼續 執行你安排給他的活? 不
So bosola can go on and carry on whatever it is you asked of him to do? No.

435
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,090
你打電話給他 結束這一切
You call him and you end this.

436
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,850
就算可以 我也不打
Even if I could, I wouldn't.

437
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:50,490
Emma Louise Taylor 生於1958年7月4日
She was born emma louise taylor, 4th of july 1958.

438
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,160
這些資料你從哪都能查到
You could get that from anywhere.

439
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,690
6歲時 她父親John帶了一隻 黑白的流浪貓回家
When she was 6, her dad john brought him a black and white homeless kitten.

440
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,860
如果她認識你...
If she knew you...

441
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,610
她會告訴我的
Emma would have told me.

442
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,020
她給它取名叫奧斯卡 以王爾德的名字命名的
She named it oscar, after oscar wilde.

443
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:14,680
王爾德所有作品中 她最喜歡"理想丈夫"
And of all oscar wilde's work,she loved an ideal husband the most.

444
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,350
我不知道你怎麼這麼瞭解Emma
I don't know how you know all of this about emma

445
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,550
也不知道你想幹什麼 咱沒什麼好說的了
or what you hope to achieve, but we're done.

446
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,290
指控你們都清楚 告我吧
You know the charges. Charge me.

447
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,190
這些瘋狂舉動都因Emma的死而起嗎?
Is that what started all this insanityemma's death?

448
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:38,560
我宣誓保護司法系統 可35年來卻只能坐視其
What started all of this was the 35 years I had to sit and watch as the system

449
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:45,060
辜負應該保護的人們 一切因此而起
I swore an oath to protect failed the very people our justice system was meant to protect.

450
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,630
不知道Emma會怎麼看待這一切
I wonder what emma would make of all this.

451
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,680
名單上每個人都應受到公正審判
Every single person on that list deserves justice,

452
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,630
而他們卻逃脫了公正
and it's justice they managed to evade.

453
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,620
那麼你真有名單
So... You do have a list.

454
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,300
我說完了
I'm finished talking.

455
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,210
有很多雙向流量 也就是說有人不想讓我們進去
Ohoh,we've got gobs of twoway traffic going on, which means someone is trying to bounce us out.

456
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,630
Bosola收費很高 Schuller法官 肯定做了大額度交易轉賬
Ok,bosola didn't come cheap, so judge schuller had to have made some pretty substantial transactions.

457
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,040
有到開曼群島的電匯 到這就斷了
Got wire transfers to a cayman island bank and that's where the trace ends.

458
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,220
多少筆 多少錢?
How many,how much?

459
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,360
六月 每幾天就借記9999元 一共4次
June,he debits numerations of $9,999 every few days,total of 4,

460
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,180
停了幾個星期 然後完成最後一筆同額轉賬
he takes a break for a few weeks until he makes his final transaction for the same magic number.

461
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,060
低於一萬就不會被國稅局追查
Anything less than $10,000 keeps the irs off your trail.

462
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,110
我也知道
I know that,too.

463
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,900
最後一筆是證實死亡後給的
So,the final payment must be for proof of death.

464
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,280
也就是殺次人5萬塊錢
That makes $50,000 the price of a kill.

465
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,330
一年內他共進行了3次這樣的轉帳
He did that 3 times over a period of 12 months, but 2 days ago,

466
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,680
但兩天前 他直接一次轉了10萬
he raided his account for $100,000 all in one hit.

467
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,650
他還註銷了所有帳戶 並把全部財產捐給受害者支持組織
He also closed all his accounts and handed his entire estate over to a victims support group.

468
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,060
有人不願意咱高科技搗亂 把我們踢出來了
Someone who isn't suffering from too many brainiacs in the hightech kitchen just bounced us out.

469
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,380
很好 謝謝
Good job.

470
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,060
計算無誤的話 名單上還有兩人 沒錯
If our calculations are correct, there are 2 more names on that list. There are.

471
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,170
名單上每個人都應受到公正審判
Every single person on that list deserves justice.

472
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,820
他說"應受"而不是"受到"
He said deserves, not deserved.

473
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,160
看這 他第二次查看時間
Now look. Right there. He looked at his watch for the second time.

474
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,530
他等的事就要發生了
Whatever he's waiting for is about to happen.

475
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,260
我覺得你一點都不瞭解Emma
I don't think you knew emma at all.

476
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,660
至少不是我所認識的那個
At least not the one I knew.

477
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,130
我編借口跟自己說 她的葬禮不會歡迎我
I made an excuse for myself that I wouldn't be welcome at her funeral.

478
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,030
事實上是我無法面對現實
But the truth is, I couldn't face it.

479
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,270
你認識Emma也改變不了什麼
You knowing emma changes nothing.

480
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,050
但的確改變了
Oh,but it does.

481
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,940
Emma改變了所有她認識的人的生活
Emma changed the lives of everyone she knew.

482
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,080
但至少我和Ray正視了她的死亡
But at least ray and I saw her death for what it truly was

483
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,250
一場慘烈的車禍
a tragic accident.

484
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,300
Dan Patton酒後駕車
Dan patton was drunk.

485
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,600
他殺了Emma 就像對她開槍一樣
He murdered emma,as surely as if he put a gun to her head.

486
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,710
所以他照片不在這?
Is that why his photo's not here?

487
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,050
留著他壓軸登場?
You're saving the best for last?

488
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,350
我們得馬上弄清Dan Patton在哪
We need to locate dan patton now.

489
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,380
10萬塊 附加的摧殘一定不輕
The 100,000 must be for some serious extras.

490
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,800
你還打算殺多少人?
How many other people have you targeted?

491
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,650
我要真話
I want the truth.

492
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,360
我該說的都說完了
I have nothing more to say.

493
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,190
我還有話要說
Oh,but I do.

494
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:34,370
幾年前在曼哈頓一家旅館 我偶然遇到Emma
I ran into emma, by chance, a few years ago, at a hotel in manhattan.

495
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,440
當時我在辦案 她也是
I was working on a case,so was she.

496
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,310
我知道她已經結婚了
I knew she was married.

497
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,980
但是我不在乎
But I didn't care.

498
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,030
她...她不會的
She... She wouldn't.

499
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:54,570
不 Emma不會這麼對我的
No. Emma would not do that to me.

500
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,950
你撒謊 是嗎?
You're lying. 

501
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,290
告訴我實情 你先說
I want the truth. You first.

502
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,190
Dan Patton是最後一個 沒有別人了
Dan patton is the last one. There are no more.

503
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,810
快告訴我實情
Now,tell me the truth.

504
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:20,360
那晚在曼哈頓 她對我說 我們如此"一拍即合"
That night in manhattan, she told me our connection was so strong,

505
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,430
僅僅一次太可惜了
it could never happen only once.

506
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,580
我當然樂意奉陪
And I was fine with that.

507
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:08,850
求你 不要 我身無分文
Please. Please don't. I have nothing, no money,nothing.Nothing

508
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,680
求你別殺我 這跟錢沒關係
please, please don't kill me. This isn't about money.

509
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,230
是因為你害死了Emma Schuller
This is about the murder of emma schuller.

510
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,670
Emma? 天啊 那完全是意外 求你了
Emma? Oh,god. Emmathat wasthat was an accident. Please.

511
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,310
是意外 求你別...
No,that was an accident.Pleaseplease don't

512
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,130
至少
at least...

513
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,760
你看到了你同事的真面目
You now know what kind of man you're working with.

514
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,280
那你的真面目又是什麼 法官?
What kind of man are you,judge?

515
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,880
我已經看夠了罪惡之事逃脫制裁
I've had enough of seeing the guilty walk free of their sins.

516
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,330
那你犯下的罪惡呢?
But what about your sins?

517
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,340
癌癥就是對我的制裁
I got cancer for mine.

518
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,430
也許他還在工作
Maybe he's still at work.

519
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,740
公司說他請假了
Workplace said he left for the day.

520
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,510
Dan Patton 我們是FBI
Dan patton, this is the fbi.

521
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,920
安全!
Clear!

522
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,810
一槍在心臟 一槍在頭部
One to the heart, one to the head.

523
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,410
知道兇手了吧
We know who did it.

524
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,100
Bosola無法離開長島的
Bosola has no way of getting off long island.

525
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,220
他們要轉移Schuller法官 什麼?
They're moving judge schuller. What?

526
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,760
他是高等法院法官  於是案子成了聯邦案件
He's a high court judge. It makes it a federal case now.

527
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,760
如果Bosola根本無意離開長島呢?
What if bosola has no intention of leaving the island?

528
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,850
Garcia說法官拿出了全部資產?
Garcia said the judge was giving his whole estate away?

529
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,680
所有房產和資金
His property,his money.

530
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,000
他註銷了所有賬戶 付清了水電費
He closed out his accounts and paid off his utility bills.

531
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,800
雖然得了癌癥 但他還有6個月時間
He has cancer,but he still has 6 months to live.

532
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,420
為什麼現在就付清所有賬單?
Is there a reason he's paying off all his bills now?

533
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,570
況且他最後那筆10萬塊付款 是殺兩個人的
Not to mention the 100,000 he made as a last and final payment for not one,

534
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,010
不是一個
but 2 kills.

535
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,840
以前他都是先確認目標死亡 再付最後一筆酬勞
Usually the judge waits for confirmation of death before making final payment.

536
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,790
這次他知道自己等不到了
Only this time he knew he wouldn't be around to see it.

537
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,570
他來了! 他在那
Here he comes! Oh,there he is.

538
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,490
Schuller法官!
Judge schuller!

539
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,120
Schuller法官在協助我們 調查一起聯邦案件
Judge schuller is helping us with a federal investigation.

540
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,990
等等 我聽不見 大點聲
Wait a minute. What? I can't hear you. Speak up.

541
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,670
Schuller法官 請問這是否與 最近的一連串謀殺案相關?
Judge schuller,does this have anything to do with the recent rash of murders?

542
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,580
我堅信 正義已經得到伸張
I am of the belief that justice has been served.

543
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Hotch 慢點 什麼?
Hotch, wait a minute. What?

544
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,110
無可奉告 Schuller法官 你如何回應有報道說...
No comment. Judge schuller, can you confirm reports...

545
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,590
我騙了你 什麼?
I lied. What?

546
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,840
你與本案有什麼關係?
Your status in this case?

547
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,850
趴下! 快趴下! 別動!
Everybody down! Get on the ground! Down on the ground! Stay down!

548
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,080
趴下!
Get down!

549
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,660
她對你意義重大
She was special to you.

550
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,430
我在想...
I was just thinking...

551
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,770
初識Emma 我就深知 她會是我今生摯愛
When I first met emma, I knew I would love her for the rest of my life.

552
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,500
那年我們12歲
We were 12 years old.

553
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,070
她常說我們注定是對苦命鴛鴦
She always said we were doomed to be starcrossed lovers,

554
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,900
只能惜嘆有緣無分
destined to wonder what might have been.

555
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,210
我從沒碰過她
I never slept with her, you know.

556
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,570
我對Schuller說的是假話
That wasn't true what I said to schuller.

557
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,810
為了激怒他 打垮他
That was just to get under his skin, knock him off his game.

558
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,910
我明白
I understand.

559
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:48,740
當初真該娶了她
I should have married her,though.

560
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:56,810
我離開海軍陸戰隊 就被招進了局
When I left the marines, I was recruited by the bureau,

561
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,870
負責了幾年黑幫團伙案子
spent a few years on the streets,

562
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,450
參與建立了BAU
got involved with starting the bau.

563
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,990
還未曾留心 人生就已匆匆過半
And before I knew it, a lifetime had gone by.

564
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,010
我知道
I hear you.

565
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:16,740
我錯過與Emma共度餘生的機會
I missed a life with emma because I became obsessed with the chase.

566
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,470
全因沉淪於追兇破案
With the hunt.

567
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,970
Dave 他威脅到了我的家人
Dave,he's threatening my family.

568
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,020
我們會抓到Foyet的 Aaron
And we'll get foyet,aaron.

569
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,520
那你是想說什麼?
Then what's your point?

570
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,890
你還有家庭
You have a family.

571
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,190
當一切了結 你要怎麼做...
When all this is over, what are you gonna do...

572
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,280
才不至於淪落到孑然一身
To make sure you're not a lonely guy wondering why

573
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:50,290
悔恨為何放走人生中...
you let the purest thing in your life...

574
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,100
最真摯純淨的感情?
Get away?

575
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,860
去哪兒啊?
Going somewhere?

576
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,820
聽過這笑話嗎 兩個愛爾蘭人...
Hear the joke about the two irishmen

577
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,790
聽過 就沒覺得好笑過
yeah,i heard it.Didn't find it funny the first time.

578
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,420
"仁慈之樹總比嚴刑律法更碩果纍纍"
"i have always found that mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice."

579
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,650
亞伯拉罕·林肯
Abraham lincoln.
