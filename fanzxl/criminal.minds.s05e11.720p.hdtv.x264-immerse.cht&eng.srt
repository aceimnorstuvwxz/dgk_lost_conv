隨機殺了個女人 然後綁架了自己的孩子
Killed aandom woman and kidnapped his kid.

27

使用同一輛卡車 可不是明智之舉啊
Used the same truck. Not the brightest bulb.

28
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,570
他被關了11年 必然疏於實踐
He's been locked up for 11 years. He's out of practice.

29
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,410

Dot they say these guys come out better criminals?

30
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,440
- 那是說聰明的人 - 你是說我笨麼?

31
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,140
你沒有耐心 很憤怒
You're impatient,angry.

32
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,170
你把孩子搶來 只是為了報復前妻
You took your own kid just to get backt your ex.

33
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,230
你倒是很清楚

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,490
- 你的前妻說... - 她在說謊 我真該殺了她
- Well,your ex-wife said-- - she was a liar.And I should have killed her.

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,870
就像殺死Stacy Ryan一樣?
Like you killed stacy ryan?

36
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,710
你為什麼要這麼做呢?
Why did yodo it?

37
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,010
- 你不會理解的 - 那你倒是說說看
- You wouldn't understand. - Try me.

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,320
- 這就是我不能理解這傢伙的地方 - 是什麼?
- Here's what I don't get about this guy. - What's that?

39
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,270
他之前一直是個小偷 出監獄之後卻成了殺人犯
His whole life he's a thief, he comes out of prison a murderer.

40
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,960
- 他殺害了一個無辜的女人 - 你怎麼知道她是無辜的?
- He killed an innocent won. - How do you know she's innocent?

41
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,780
你捅死了她 把她從卡車堨等X來
You stabbed her and threw herout of.

42
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,010
她能對你做什麼?
What the hell did she ever do to you?

43
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,490
我就不明白了 你咋就不能珍惜現在的自由呢
You know, what I don't get is why you couldn't just appreciate the freedom.

44
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,610
你可以一直住在那個小屋 享受安靜的生活
You could have holed up in that cabin a long time, enjoyed the quiet.

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,150
可有人就是這麼不安分
But some people just need the distractions.

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,280
估計是被關太久 關得快發瘋了
You probably got used to all that madness when you were locked up.

47
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,590
小羊羔去跟大灰狼討論和平共處 這才叫發瘋呢
It's madness for the sheep to talk peace with a wolf.

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,560
你這像是我爸爸說出來的話
You that soundst used to alike somethings whenmy daddy would say.

49
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,390
- Thomas Fuller (17世紀歷史學家 教士) - 覺得我不賴吧?
- Thomas fuller. - You impressed?

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,640
我只很驚訝 這麼說 你是大灰狼了
I'm surprised. So you're the wolf.

51
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,070
- 你不會知道的 - 又來了 還是那麼自負
- You have no idea. - There it is. That ego.

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
你知道 有那麼一下 你還真叫人難以預測
You know, for one second, you were unpredictable.

53
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,430
但你忍不住 你總是要去"一鳴驚人"
But you can'help yourself. You gotta talk a big talk.

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,450
這麼做也太無聊了
But just so you know, that's boring.

55
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,090
嘿 怎麼了? 坐直了

Oh,i'm gonna be sick. - can you turn the light on?

- 我一定是病了 - 噢 到底怎麼回事?
- I'm nna be sick. - Oh,what the hell?

You're gonna need stitches.

74
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,690
我不要去醫院
I'm not going to the hospital.

75
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,600
血流很多 壓住它
There's a lot of blood. Put pressure on it.

76
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,990
- 把槍給我 - 你會沒事的

"men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit,

First case back,wwon, and you'll be home for breakfast.

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,310
我們一直不知道為什麼Schrader 要殺了Stacy Ryan
We never figured out why schrader killed stacy ryan.

93
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,530
她跟他的前妻和孩子沒有任何關係

- Uh,emily murmured a partial. - Better than nothing.

102
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,410
他可能往加拿大走了 我們需要熟悉這片區域的人
He could be headed to canada. We need somebody who knows the area.

103

Schrader曾經搶過銀行
Schrader was a bank robber.

106
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,070
現在他殺了一個女人 綁架自己的女兒 又殺了一個警察
Now he's murdered a woman, kidnapped his daughter, and killed a cop.

107
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,270
他顯然比我們之前想像的要複雜的多
He's obviously more sophisticated than we originally thought.

108
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,130
他有更大的計劃 不僅僅是帶著女兒逃到國外去
He's got a bigger plan. It's not just about getting his daughter and fleeing the country.

109
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,320
咱們的側寫 從沒出現他的同夥
We never profiled that he'd have a partner.

110
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,690
我們一點也不瞭解這個人
We don't know this guy at all.

111
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,540
你可比我想像的牛多啦
Got to admit you're better than I thought.

112
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,280
- 那幫笨蛋連什麼襲擊他們的都不知道 - 坐好了你
- Those idiots don't know what hit them. - Sit still.

113
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,500
至少給我點阿司匹林吧
At least give me some aspirin.

114
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,110
拜託 你還真下的了手?

- 我手上沒鑰匙 - 什麼?
- I don't have the key. - What?

117

My contact wasn't there. Her shift starts at 8:00.

明天? 那我們只能等著了?
Tomorrow? So we're just gonna wait?

119
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,800
你知道麼 如果你沒殺那個警察 事情就不會這麼嚴重
You know,this wouldn't be such a big deal if you hadn't killed a cop.

120
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,640
噢 他沒完沒了地說話
Oh,he didn't know when to shut up.

121
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,010
知道接下來會怎麼著嗎?
You know what's gonna happen now?

122
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,690
大街小巷都會貼滿你的照片 增加兩倍警力巡邏
They're gonna put your picture everywhere.

123
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,250
你把你逃離這堛瑣鷛|都給搞砸了
You just screwed your chances of ever tting out of here.

124
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,610
好吧 看 這就是為啥把你拉進來了
Well,see,that's where you come in.

125
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,010
我相信你的
Got faith in you.

126
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,720
這會留疤麼?
Is this gonna leave a scar?

127
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,560
- 不 我們得找到Schrader - 有咱的人負責著呢
- No,we gotta find schrader. - The team's got it covered.

128
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,380
我不要待在這 我真的很好 趕緊把這車停了
Don't make me stay here. I'fine,honestly. Pull this thing over.

129
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,580
Prentiss 你都沒法集中精力 你摔得腦震盪了
Prentiss,you can't even focus. You have a concussion.

130
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,960
- 我看見那個人了 - 白人  四十多歲 我知道了
- I saw the guy. - White,40s,i know.

131
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,460
好吧 你給我做個認知測試
Ok,so give me a cognitive interview.

132
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
- 你腎上腺急速升高 - 肯定的啊
- Your adrenaline's pumping. - Exactly.

133
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,780
- Emily 你剛受了驚嚇 - 它突然就那麼發生了 我從未這麼清醒過
- Emily,you're in shock. - It just happened. It'll never be clearer.

134
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,840
- 你開了幾槍? - 3槍
- How many shots did you fire? - 3.

135
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,180
你子彈夾都打空了
You emptied your clip.

136
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,070
不... 真的嗎?
No... I did?

137
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,110
Schrader在90年代 參與了一系列的銀行搶劫
All right,so schrader pulled a series of bank heists in the 1990s.

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,170
是那些案子堸艉@一個 得了自由身的人
Was the only one to ever go away for the crimes.

139
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,530
他是個模範囚徒 判了15年 剛待11年就出來了
He was a model prisoner, on served 11 of his 15 years,

140
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,190
就是因為表現良好
Was released early on good behavior,

141
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,090
他那些朋友不是死了 就是還在監獄
and any friends he had are either dead or still in prison.

142
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,450
在事發地北邊 離加拿大不遠處 發現了一輛3噸的卡車
A 3-ton truck was found north of the accident, not too far from canada.

143
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,210
我們在邊境處部署了最強大的警力 他可能知道
We have the heaviest presence at border crossings. He probably knows that.

144
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,080
我覺得他不可能長時間坐得住
I don't think he's gonna sit still for long.

145
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,870
沒準不得不靜養 得根據他的傷勢來看
He might have to depending onow injured he is.

146
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,410
- 我們現在掌握了什麼? - Dale Schrader曾因搶劫入獄
- What do we know? - dale schrader went to prison for robbery.

147
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,680
他幹得很利落 所犯罪行都不是出於個人恩怨
He was hands off. All of hiss were impersonal.

148
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,120
可釋放才兩天 就殺了Stacy Ryan 綁架自己的女兒
2 days after hs released, he kills stacy ryan and he kidnaps his dauter.

149
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,000
這完全是針對個人 也很情緒化
It's both personal and emotional.

150
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,990
他對犯案並無情感投入 所以往往成功 但一旦投入感情
But the minute he's invested,

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
比如和女兒在一起時 他就放鬆了警惕 導致被抓 這也可以理解
like with his daughter, he lethis guard down and gets caught. It makes sense.

152
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,580
看來不像我們所想的那麼難搞
So he's not the hard-ass we thought he was.

153
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,740
但如果他只是想得到Jenny 不已經得到了嘛 完全可以離開
But if jenny were what he wanted, he had her. He could have left.

154
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,510
沒錯 我們以為他會帶著她去加拿大 對吧?
Yeah,we thought he took her and ran to canada,right?

155
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,110
這麼說來很合理啊 為什麼沒這麼做呢?
That theory made sense. Why didn't he?

156
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,670
- 事故現場採集的照片 - Emily現在怎麼樣?
- Pictures from the accident. - Any word on emily?

157
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,030
- 目前正和醫生吵著呢 - 那就還好
- Apparently she's arguing with the doctors. - That's good.

158
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,240
這一定是頗費周折才辦到的
This took a lot to pull off.

159
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,510
如果他背後有一堆人可以召集呢?
What if he's got a group of guys to call on?

160
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,780
我也這麼覺得 雖說所有的銀行劫案都是個人所為
I agree.All those bank jobs were a solo,

161
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,460
但看上去 一個人很難策劃得這麼周全
but this is a lot for one man to orchestrate.

162
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,060
知道他為什麼殺害Stacy Ryan了麼?
Figured out why he killed stacy ryan?

163
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,500
還沒找到她和Schrader有任何關聯 但也許和他的同夥有關係
We haven't found any connection to schrader, but he may be connected to the partner.

164
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,200
怎麼說?
How?

165
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,450
殺了她 很可能是把他救出來的一個條件
Killing her might have been advance payment for breaking him out of custody.

166
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,960
- 在 - Garcia 需要所有Stacy Ryan的信息
- Yes. - Garcia,i need evething you've got on stacy ryan.

167
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,660
你說他逃了是什麼意思?
What do you mean he got away?

168
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,770
- 有人把他救了出去 - 噢 天啊
- Somebody broke him out of custody. - Oh,god.

169
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,200
你們倆必須待在這
We're gonna keep the two of you here.

170
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,110
會有警官隨時在此監視所有情況
There's gonna be an officer standing watch the entire ti.

171
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,290
你們都找不到他 這保證我們的安全 啥時是個頭啊
You can't find him, how long will you keep us safe.

172
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
- 夫人 我們會找到他的 - 你不瞭解Dale
- ma'am,we will find him. - You don't know dale.

173
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,870
他想要什麼 就一定會得到
When he wants something, he gets it.

174
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,990
你能想到有誰可能幫他的嗎?

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,740
- 他從來不相信任何人 - 這不是信不信任的問題
- Heoesn't trust anybody. - It's not necessarily about trust.

176
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,390
可能是他曾經有恩於某人 那個人不過是來回報而已?
Maybe somebody who's indebted to him and he was trying to colle on it?

177
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,150
我真的不知道
I don't know.

178
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,200
Jenny
Jenny.

179
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,200
一直都只有你和你爸爸嗎?
You and your dadere alone the entire time?

180
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,490
卡車和小木屋堻ㄗS人?
Nobody was in the truck or the cabin?

181
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,020
- 沒人 - 誰會幫Dale幹這事?
- Nobody. - Who uld do this for dale?

182
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,420
誰會奮不顧身地幫他?
Who would risk everything to help him?

183
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,460
那就是我們要找的
At's what we nd to find out.

184
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,910
Stacy Ryan的人生只有兩種狀態 吸毒 和等著吸毒
Acy ryan had two times in her life-- when she was high and when she was waiting to get high.

185
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,250
我發現他倆之間的唯一聯繫 就是她哥哥在五年前...
The only thread I have between them is that her brother spent time with schrader upstate like...

186
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,590
和Schrader一起待過一段
5 years ago.

187
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,250
- 為什麼Schrader要殺一個癮君子? - 這沒道理啊
- Why would schrader kill a junkie? - It doesn't make sense.

188
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,790
- 哥哥現在在哪? - 死了
- Where's the brother now? - Dead.

189
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,350
並不感覺Schrader是在胡亂犯案
It doesn't feel like schrader does anything randomly.

190
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,230
Stacy對他來說 肯定有什麼特別的地方
Stacy must have meant something to him.

191
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,770
是的  但...到底是什麼?
Yeah,but... What?

192
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,510
不用麻煩了 我看見她了
Never mind,i see her.

193
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,990
我來接她離開 謝謝
I can take her from here. Thanks.

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,320
- 謝謝 我能走了 - 坐著
- Thank you. I can walk. - Sit.

195
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,020
我就喜歡推著你走
I like pushing you around.

196
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,620
還疼麼?
Does it hurt?

197
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,490
如果你指的是我整個身子 那就是了
If by "it" you mean my entire body,then yes.

198
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,500
Jenny看見什麼了嗎?
Did jenny see anything?

199
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,460
- 她從沒看見同夥 - 太糟了
- Shnever saw the partner. - Oh,what the hell?

200
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,450
他們在事故現場不遠處 發現了一輛廢棄卡車
They found a truck ditched a few miles from the accident.

201
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,920
牌照沒了 但肯定是撞著你們的那輛
Plates were missing, but the front end definitely hit your car.

202
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,290
所以同夥在樹林堿搢ㄓF全過程 逃跑了 還去偷了一輛卡車?
Ok,so the partner saw everything in the woods, he ran away and stole a truck?

203
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,520
他到底是何方神聖?
Who is this guy?

204
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,650
他知道你們會走那條道回局
He knew you were taking that road back to the station.

205
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,720
他埋伏在那 然後伏擊你們 這整件事也太滴水不漏了
He waited for you and he crashed into you. This whole thing feels meticulous.

206
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,500
所以他需要同夥來佈置其它的事
Ok,so he needs the partner for something else.

207
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,370
為了什麼?
For what,though?

208
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,320
不清楚 可他從始至終一直被鎖住的
Well,i don't know. I mean,he was locked up all this time.

209
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,190
他盤算了一整天 應該還有很多備用計劃
He planned the whole day. He should have had backup plans for his backup plans.

210
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,710
他的前妻有幾個小時不在家
His ex shouldn't have been home for a few hours,

211
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,010
在我們出現之前 他有足夠的時間和Jenny越過邊界
So he clearly had enough time to get across the border with jenny until we showed up.

212
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,920
但是他選擇留在當地 藏身於小屋中
But he stayed local, holed up in that cabin.

213
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,120
已經得到想要的了 他應該立刻就逃跑
He had what he wanted. He could have just run.

214
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,520
肯定還有其它什麼事 讓他留在了洛克波特
There's gotta be something else keeping him in lockport.

215
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,520
我看著他勒死Bunting 卻無能為力
I couldn't stop him from choking bunting.

216
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,630
- Emily 不要這樣 - 就眼睜睜地看著
- Emily,don't do that. - He was right there.

217
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,220
新聞上鋪天蓋地都是Schrader的照片
Schrader's face is all over the news.

218
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,850
他已經逃了兩個小時了 還是毫無頭緒
He's been on the run foalmost 2 hours and 're no closer to catching him.

219
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,270
我們需要找到他的同夥
We need to find the partner.

220
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,650
- 怎麼樣了? - 感覺像是被卡車撞了
- How are you? - I feel like I got hit by a truck.

221
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,090
- 這塈 - 謝謝
- Here,sit. - Thanks.

222
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,520
Garcia 告訴大家你剛剛說給我的
Uh,garcia,tell everyone what you just told me.

223
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,580
我挖掘出了更多Schrader的過去
I have unearthed more of schrader's past.

224
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,450
我們已經知道 他在90年代搶劫了紐約州的15家銀行
Now,what we do know is that he robbed 15 banks inhe state of new york in the nineties.

225
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,420
但是 魅力驚人聰明無比的我剛剛發現
However,what your resident glamour-puss smarty-pants just found out

226
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,790
大部分的贓款還沒有被追回
Was that most of that money was never recovered.

227
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,480
- 那在哪呢? - 我猜最大的可能 是只有他知道
- Where is it? - My best guess-- only he knows.

228
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,660
待在洛克波特的好理由
Good reason to stick around lockport.

229
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,430
最後一次搶劫 被捕的那次 應該也只是按著例行計劃吧?
The last robbery, the one that put him away, should have been routine, right?

230
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,420
- 怎麼就被抓了呢? - 也許什麼人出賣了他
- So what happened? - Maybe someone turned him in.

231
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,130
他一直自己行動 誰出賣了他?
He kept to himself, always worked alone. Who'd turn him in?

232
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,310
我們遺漏了什麼人
We're missing somebody.

233
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,960
- Garcia - 好的 這就查 長官
- Rcia. - Yes,checking,sir.

234
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,350
- 這是為了什麼? - 明天早上之前什麼都不用做
- What's this all about? - Nothing to do till morning.

235
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,450
你有什麼困擾?
What's your problem?

236
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,110
猶豫是成功的絆腳石
Hesitation puts obstacle in the path.

237
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
無畏能使我們不再猶豫 無畏能驅走恐懼
Boldness eliminates them. Boldness strikes fear.

238
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,910
恐懼造就權力
Fear creates authority.

239
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,880
"權力的48條定律" 聽說過沒?
"the 48 laws of power." You know It?

240
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,960
想要對我開槍嗎?
you want to shoot me?

241
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,690
我說謝謝了沒?
Have I said thanks yet?

242
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,980
好了 Schrader的逮捕記錄引出了 另一個叫Dan Otey的銀行搶劫犯
Ok. Records leading up to schrader's arrest show this other bank robber named dan otey.

243
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,970
他有足夠的時間
And he was looking at copious amounts of time,

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,580
他簽了個協議 突然間Schrader就被逮捕了
Then he strikes a deal and all of a sudden schrader is arrested.

245
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,950
不可能是巧合
It can't be a coincidence.

246
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,620
罪犯之間互相收買 倒不少見
You know,it's not uncommon for criminals to buy jobs off one another.

247
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,720
也許Schrader這麼做了 Dan Otey出賣了他 得到了減刑
Maybe that's what schrader did, budan otey sold him out for a lesser sentence.

248
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,890
難以理解 Otey背叛了他 現在卻成了同夥?
It doesn't make sense. Otey was a rat and now he's the partner?

249
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,000
說對了 Schrader不會信任他 如果可能的話 他會希望他死掉
Yeah,you're right. Schrader wouldn't trust him. If anything, he'd want him dead.

250
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,150
有可能 但也會先利用他
Probably, but he'd use him fir.

251
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,470
他告訴Otey他欠他一命 而這件事可以讓他撿回條命
He'd telotey that he owes him one and that he might save his life

252
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,000
要他能幫助自己躲過這次追捕
if he helps him get out of this m.

253
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,550
他現在在哪 Garcia?
Where's he now,garcia?

254
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,600
Dan Otey是當地人 住在7號公路
Uh,dan otey is a local. He lives off of route 7.

255
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,460
沒有人 我們上
Nobody's here.Let's go.

256
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,850
- 你爸爸在家嗎? - 你是誰?
- is your ddy home? - Who are you?

257
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,470
關上門!
Close the door!

258
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,090
別這麼做

259
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,970
冷靜 我只是嚇一嚇他
Ca down. I'm just gonna scare him a little bit.

260
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,400
嘿 Dan!
Hey,dan!

261
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,400
你讓你的兒子應門?
You sent your son to the door?

262
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,440
懦夫
Coward.

263
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,850
- 他的妻子和兒子都在家 - 他們沒事嗎?
- His wife and son were home. - Are they ok?

264
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,020
他的搭檔帶他們去了樓上 Schrader毀了現場
While schrad destroyed the place.

265
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,960
Emily正陪著妻子
Emily is with the wife right now.

266
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,340
Dan已經改過自新了
Dan had tued everything around.

267
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,350
他變好了 生活也終於好轉了
He was clean, life was finally good.

268
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,080
但是我總是不敢相信 你知道嗎?
But I was always afraid to believe I you know?

269
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,710
因為他可能被殺掉
Because then he could be taken ay.

270
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,720
請節哀
I'm so sorry.

271
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,100
另一個人 他什麼長相?
The other man-- what did he look like?

272
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:30,100
白人...40多歲...短髮
Uh,white... Mid-40s... Short hair...

273
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,160
我記不清了
I don't know.

274
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,340
你以前見過他嗎?
Had you ever seen him before?

275
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,280
見過Dale 但是沒見過另外一個
Dale,yeah. The other guy,no.

276
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,480
我們正在查 Schrader怎麼認識他的同夥的
We're trying to figure out how schrader knows his partner.

277
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,560
我不知道
I have no idea.

278
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,320
他們互相說什麼了?
How did they talk to each other?

279
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,020
啥也沒說
They didn't.

280
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,110
Dale把房子砸了 另一個把我們帶到樓上
Dale trashed the place, and the other guy took us upstairs.

281
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,160
他一直推著我...
He kept pushing and...

282
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,110
Jason.... 我不知道會發生什麼
Jason.... I didn't know what was gonna happen.

283
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,700
他傷你了嗎?
Did he hurt you?

284
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,600
他只是嚇我們 把我們鎖在堶悸漫迠
He just scared us. He locked us in the back room.

285
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,030
他把你們鎖進屋子 就沒有了?
He locked you in the room and that's it?

286
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,160
是 他叫我們閉嘴 並且一直扣著門
Yeah. He told us to shut up and keep it locked.

287
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,620
但是Jason一直哭個不停
But jason wouldn't stop crying.

288
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,570
這可不是我們說好的
This wasn't the deal.

289
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,330
- 是嗎? - 我可沒有同意要殺人
- Really? - I didn't sign up to kill anybody.

290
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,700
你救了我 你把我從車里拉了出來 記得嗎?
You saved my ass. You pulled me out of that car,remember?

291
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,730
- 然後才有人死了 - 我做不來
- Then people died. - I can't do it. I won't.

292
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,100
不 你會的
Yes,you will.

293
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,660
你恐嚇了那家人 殺了父親
You terrorized that family. You killed their father.

294
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,040
不用擔心 孩子還小 他不會記得父親的
Don't worry. The kid is young. He won't remember him.

295
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,750
我也殺了警察 可別忘了他
I also killed that cop. Don't forget about him.

296
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,830
- 你很享受 - 對 我是
- You enjoyed it. - Yes,i did.

297
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
但是你沒有阻止我
And you didn't stop me.

298
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,910
明白了 你做你想做的事
I get it. You gotta do what you gotta do.

299
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,150
我做我的 來吧 快要結束了
And I want what I want. Come on,bro. Almost done.

300
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,610
Schrader掌控著一切
Schrader gets off on power.

301
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,430
這和錢一樣成為他的動機
That and money are what motivate him.

302
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,200
還有復仇 11年後 他變成了殺人犯
And revenge. 11 years away, he comes out a murderer.

303
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,190
同夥應該和他一樣膽大
Who needs a partner, somebody as bold as him.

304
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,620
他們在哪媢J見的?
And where'd they meet?

305
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,270
Schrader遠遠的 一直忍耐著
Schrader was away and patient.

306
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,750
一出來就先和他的同夥接上了頭
The minute he got out, he hooked up with his partner first,

307
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,810
然後在綁架自己女兒的路上 殺了Stacy Ryan
And then he killed stacy ryan on his way to kidnap his daughter.

308
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,210
- 那一天堣痐F什麼? - 錢
- What's missing from his day. - The money.

309
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,710
帶走女兒卻留下錢 這講不通
He took his daughter but left the money. That doesn't make any sense.

310
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,540
他有其它的計劃 保證在加拿大的生存嗎?
Did he have another plan how to support himself in canada?

311
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,300
他只知道犯罪的生活 不可能改變 時間的流逝已經證明了這點
He's only known a life of crime. He's incapable of change. Time away proved that.

312
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,430
Otey的老婆說 同夥把他們鎖起來 好像他不想傷害他們
Well,otey's wife said that the partner locked them away, like he didn't want them to get hurt.

313
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,050
他想要保護 很奇怪 對吧?
He was protective. T?

314
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,280
他們都是支配型人格 卻像是一個扮紅臉 一個扮黑臉
They're both dominant personalities, but they sound like they played good cop/bad cop.

315
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,975
距離案件發生已經4個小時了
Well,it's been 4 hours since the accident.

316
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,180
你還覺得我沒緩過來?
You still think I'm in shock?

317
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,980
只有一種辦法證明了
There's one way to find out.

318
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,440
第一件事 我們到局堮釣噾_匙
Ok. First thing, we go to the staon, gonna get the key.

319
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,550
然後我們去9點開門的那家銀行 就大功告成了
Then we go to the bank which opens at 9:00. Then we're done.

320
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,380
沒那麼容易 我說過的
It's not that easy. I told you.

321
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,870
對我來說不容易 但你 每個人都喜歡你
Not for me. But you-- Everybody loves you.

322
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,890
好吧 我加入 然後呢
Ok,i do this. Then what?

323
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,910
- 然後就結束了 - 不
- Then it's over. - No.

324
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,250
- 不? - 不 我不可能還能活著
- No? - No. There's no version of me surviving this.

325
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,920
你得到你想要的 我就活不成了
You get what you want, I'm dead.

326
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,000
如果你這麼想的話 就來吧
Well,if you believe that, do it.

327
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,990
來吧  你現在就能阻止一切
Go ahead. You can stop this right now.

328
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,650
你想要我死 有多想? 下手啊
You want me dead. How bad? Come on.

329
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,280
殺了我啊 怎麼了?
Kill me. What?

330
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,270
還要我幫你嗎? 要嗎?
You need my help? Is that what you need?

331
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,190
你知道我的 不達到目的我絕不罷休
You know I'm not gonna stop this unl I get what I want.

332
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,150
我不會停手的 但你可以
I'm not gonna stop it, but you can.

333
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,600
想阻止這一切嗎? 那就動手吧 結束這一切
You want to d it? Then do it. End it.

334
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,120
來啊 動手啊 把握機會 你就如願了
Come on. Do it. Take a chance that this all works out for you.

就知道你下不了手
that's what I thought.

337
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,470
你做不出這種事 Joe 從來都下不了手
It's not in you,joe. never was.

338
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,480
好 深呼吸 Prentiss
All right, take a deep breath,prentiss.

339
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,580
- 我準備好了 - 好的

很安靜啊
It's really quiet.

347
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,320
當時路上還有別的車子嗎?
Are there any other cars on the road?

348
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,240
- 有一輛車在過來 - 是什麼顏色的?
- There's one coming. - What color is it?

349
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,960
我... 燈太亮了
I... It's too bright.

350
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,420
好 但你還是看了 你看到了
Ok,but you looked at it. You saw it.

351
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,910
是輛四門轎車 是黑色的
It's a 4-door hybrid, black.

352
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,690
Schrader呢?
Where was schrader?

353
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,580
- 他在看窗外 - 看起來在等誰嗎?
- He's looking out the window. - Was he waiting for something?

354
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,410

是那輛卡車 Schrader看著它
It's the truck. Schrader sees it.

356
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,640
然後就不對勁了 他... 解開了安全帶
That's when it happens. He's... Out of his seatbelt.

357
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,580
彎下了腰
He's hunched over.

358
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,070
然後他解開了前面的手銬
And he gets his cuffs out in front of him.

- You're sure it was the truck? - Yeah. It's a big truck.

安全帶卡住了
My seatbelt is jammed.

372
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,470
我透不過氣了 什麼都看不見 能聽見--
I can't breathe. I can't see anything.I can hear--

373
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,590
哦 天吶 他在勒Bunting的脖子
oh,god, he's killing bunting.

374
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,570
- 但他的同伴還沒出現? - 沒有
- But the partner's not the yet? - No.

375
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,900
他在哪?
Where is he?

376
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,350
正在跑過來
He's running towards us.

377
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,330
- 他穿什麼衣服? - 牛仔褲和靴子
- What's he wearing? - Jeans. Boots.

378
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,950
你搞什麼? 幹嘛殺條子?
What's wrong with you? You killed a cop?

379
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,950
Bunting死了他很慌張
He's freaked out that bunting's dead.

380
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,710
- 他為什麼這麼在意? - 我不知道
- Why would he care? - I don't know.

381
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,010
但是他不讓他殺我
But he won't let him kill me.

382
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,500
- 把槍給我 - 她是FBI
- Give me the gun. - She's a fed.

383
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,470
她知道我們倆了現在
She knows that there's two of us now.

384
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,530
他一直在和他說...
And he keeps telling him to...

385
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,790
- 壓著點 - 壓在出血的地方
- Put pressure on it. - On the bleeding.

386
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,670
- 會沒事的 - 好嗎
- It's gonna be ok. - Ok.

387
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,670
等等 他是在和我說話
Wait. He was talking to me.

388
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,730
用力壓著
There's a lot ot pressure on it.

389
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,760
你會沒事的 聽見了嗎?
You're gonna be all right. Understand?

390
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,670
他知道我們會走那條路
He knew we were on that road.

391
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,280
Bunting死了他很難過
He was upset that bunting was dead.

392
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,150
他不讓Schrader殺了我
He wouldn't let schrader kill me.

393
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,220
他一直叫我壓著傷口
He kept telling me to put pressure on it.

394
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,090
他還很鎮定 好像以前就這麼幹過
And he was calm,like he's 

395
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,240
他是在幫我
He was helping me.

396
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,420
他把Dan Otey的家人帶到樓上 不讓Schrader傷害他們
He took dan otey's family upstairs, protected them from schrader.

397
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,710
你們真以為會有個好人和 Dale Schrader一樣的罪犯搭檔嗎?
Do we really think a good guy hooked up with a criminal like dale schrader?

398
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,080
您有一通留言
You have one saved message.

399
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,170
Joe 親愛的 是我
joe,honey,it's me.

400
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,290
他找到我們了 我們三個 我也不知道我們現在在哪
Ey got us. All of us. I don't know where we are.

401
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,170
- 天啊 我對不起你 - 救我 爸爸!
- God,i am so sorry. - Helus,daddy!

402
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,710
照他說的做好嗎? 求你 他讓你做什麼就做什麼
just do what he says,ok? Please just do whatever he says.

403
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,430
Joe 救救我們
Joe,help us.

404
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,580
Joe 親愛的 是我 他找到我們了
Joe,honey,it's me. He got us.

405
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,620
你就要做到了 幹得真棒
You've almost got it. You're doing so good.

406
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,890
對不起 求求你了
I'm sorry. Lease.

407
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,060
哦 我的天啊 我的天 求求你不要!
Oh,my god. My god,please stop!

408
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,000
別碰他!
Don't you touch him!

409
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,350
不是他的錯 是我讓他解的
It's not his fault. I told him to do it.

410
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,060
- 不 等等! 你要幹什麼? - 媽媽! 媽媽!
- No,wait! What are you doing? - Mom! Mommy!

411
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,580
不要! 別帶走我的孩子!
No! Don't take my kid!

412
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,560
媽媽! 媽媽! 媽媽 救我!
Mom! Mommy! Mom,help!

413
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,770
媽媽!
Mom!

414
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,380
那Schrader是怎麼讓他入伙的?
So how did schrader get this guy to sign on?

415
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,930
好人幹壞事
Good people do bad things.

416
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,400
要我說 常有的事
I'm just saying, it happens.

417
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,830
是沒錯 可這個同夥不想讓我死
Right. But this partner wouldn't let me die.

418
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,570
他還保護了Otey的家人
He protected otey's family.

419
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,640
就在同一天 他卻協助一個重罪犯潛逃
In the same day, he helped a convicteder felon escape custody.

420
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,530
他也太忠心了
His loyalties are all over the place.

421
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,160
這人聽起來無路可走了 也許他需要錢
The guy sounds desperate. Maybe he needs some money.

422
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,820
Schrader可還留著一大筆錢呢
I mean,schrader's got a lot of it still out there.

423
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,270
可能答應給他一份
He could have promised him a cut.

424
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,830
啊 我不這麼想 他可是三起謀殺案 一起綁架案的幫兇啊
Ah,i don't know. He's an accomplice to 3 murders and a kidnapping.

425
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,650
你會為了錢幹這些嗎?
Is there enough mone out there

426
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,070
那就是比錢重要的東西
so it's something bigger than the money.

427
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,390
嗯 也許是Schrader威脅他的
Um,maybe schrader's threatening him.

428
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,030
- 把柄? - 一定是很重要的把柄
- Leverage? - It would have to be big.

429
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,190
我們能抓到Schrader是因為 他綁架了自己的女兒
We caught schrader because he kidnapped his daughter.

430
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,030
他很情緒化 戒備鬆懈
He was emotionaland his guard w.

431
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,900
很明顯 家人對他的重要性 超過了我們的預期
Clearly,family means more to him than we thought.

432
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,270
Schrader的前妻曾強迫他 放棄對Jenny的監護權
Schrader's ex-wife he was eforced him to give up Custody jenny.

433
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,830
或許他也想讓這人嘗嘗 失去家人的滋味
Maybe he wants this guy to know what it feels like to lose s family,too.

434
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,300
- 我覺得就是報復 - 或許就是
- It sounds like revenge to me. - Maybe it is.

435
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,780
知道我不能理解什麼嗎?
You know what I just don't get?

436
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,340
為什麼大家總覺得你是個英雄
Why pele think you're a hero.

437
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,270
我瞭解他們不瞭解的那一面 其實你只想成為和我一樣的人
I know something they don't. You want to be just like me.

438
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,000
老實巴交的無聊人 太容易被看穿了
Honest men bore you. They're too predictable.

439
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,810
要你平凡生活還不如要你去死 那你就冒點險 試探底限
And you'd rather die than be ordinary, so you take ris and you push the limits.

440
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,190
可你從小就被教導要做個好人
But you were raised to be a good guy.

441
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,570
你骨子奡N這樣 不能控制
It's in your blood. You can't help it.

442
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,520
可那樣就泯滅了一小部分的你
But that kills you a little bit.

443
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,690
所以你要想辦法從好人變成壞人
That's why you had to figure out a way for a good guy you to be bad,

444
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,680
所以你就遇到了我
And that's how you got into my world.

445
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,900
- 我猜得對不對? - 我想和他們說話
- Am I close? - I want to talk to them.

446
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,890
你聽到留言了 也看到照片了
You got your message and that picture.

447
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,210
我怎麼知道你是不是早就把他們殺了?
How do I know you haven't killed them already?

448
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,560
你只能相信我
You have to trust me.

449
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,120
我太失望了
Well,i'm disappointed.

450
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,340
可你老婆孩子會受不了的 因為他們不一定非得死
But your wife and your kids are gonna be devastated 'cause they didn't have to die.

451
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,140
反正你也會殺了我 傷害他們有什麼意義
Look,you're gonna kill me. There's no point in hurting them.

452
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,660
你算什麼父親?
What kind of father are you?

453
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,260
我們已經說好了 只有我知道他們在哪
We've been over this. I'm the only one who ows where they are.

454
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,180
只要我還活著 他們就沒事
As long as I'm alive, they're safe.

455
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,450
如果你不幫我了 他們就會死 怎麼樣?
If you stop helping me, they're dead. How's that?

456
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,340
Scader的案子有進展了嗎?
Anything on scader's case?

457
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,680
很普通的嫌疑人-- 法官 律師
The usual suspects-- judge,lawyers.

458
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,280
今天早上都通知他們了
They're all accounted for this morning.

459
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,640
如果這是報復 一定有什麼人很排斥他
If it's revenge, then it's gotta be someone who put him away.

460
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,740
他不是警察逮捕的 也不是法官判的刑
Well,it's not the officers who arrested him or the judge who sentenced him.

461
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,900
到底是誰?
Then who is it?

462
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,710
Garcia 把執法部門每個參與了 Schrader案子的探員名字給我
Garcia,i need the names of every law enforcement agent involved in the schrader case.

463
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,110
你都知道了啊
Yoknow everybody.

464
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,090
是的 還要他被捕那年所有員工的資料
Yeah,but I want every single empyee the year that he was arrested.

465
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,520
好 一分鐘
Ok,give me a minute.

466
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,180
要一分鐘? 加油 寶貝 不會掉線了吧?
A whole minute? Come on,baby girl,what, are you losing your touch?

467
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,690
哦 給我講話當心點
Oh,watch your pretty mouth.

468
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,090
人事材料來了
Personnel records come at you now.

469
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,330
- 還有誰在職? - 大多數人都還在
- Who's still active? - Most.

470
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,570
他會利用一個在職警官嗎?
Would he risk using an activofficer?

471
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,090
看他有多恨他們了 有人退休了嗎?
Depends on how much he hates them. Has anyone retired?

472
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,370
有 兩個 看看-- Matt Massey 和Jeff Messick
Yeah,two of them. Let's see--matt massey, jeff messick.

473
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,010
- 都結婚有孩子了 白人 50幾歲 - 等等 能給我看看照片嗎?
- Both married with kids, white,in eir 50s. - Wait,can I see those pictures?

474
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,880
不是
No.

475
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,910
不是
No.

476
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,900
他為什麼就不去找逮捕他的警察呢?
Why wouldn't he go after one of the officers who arrested him?

477
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,930
這樣才最說得通是報復啊
It makes the most sense for revenge.

478
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,480
嘿嘿 等等 夥計們 看這個
Hey,wait a minute,guys. Listen to this.

479
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,050
有一目擊證人沒有代表Schrader作證
There was a witness who never testified on schrader's behalf.

480
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,090
Schrader會認為這是背叛
Schrader could see that as a betrayal.

481
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,340
他一出獄就利用他作案
He getout of prison and uses him to get what he wants.

482
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,940
Garcia 查一下Schrader案子的一個 目擊證人的檔案 Joey Short
Garcia,i want you to run a history on a witness from the schrader case, joey short.

483
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,380
Joey Short 66年出生在紐約
Joey short. Was born in '66 in nyc.

484
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,860
除了混吸毒聚會 沒幹過別的正經活
Didn't hold a lot of jobs except for construction.

485
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,310
- 是戒毒中心的常客 - 他現在住哪?
- In and out of rehab. - Where is he now?

486
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,560
他最新的顯示住址是10年前的
His last known address wa10 years ago.

487
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,940
- 他在坐牢嗎? - 沒有
- Did he do time? - No.

488
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,510
再查查 Gacia 人不會無緣無故失蹤的
Come on,gcia. People don't just disappear.

489
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,610
這人的檔案有很多漏洞
This guy's got a history with a lot of holes in it.

490
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,120
他去過戒毒中心 也許會遵守諾言
He went to rehab. You know,maybe this guy had to walk the walk.

491
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,690
- 他是臥底 - 這樣就說得通了
- He was undercover. - That makes sense.

492
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,090
這些人什麼都幹得出來 能冒險 不管是工作上還是私生活方面
Those guys e up for anything, and they take big risks, professionally and personally.

493
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,990
他的行為也能解釋了 好人幹壞事
It explains his behavior,too. Good guy doing bad things.

494
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Garcia Joey Short的真名是什麼?
Garcia,can you get us joey short's real name?

495
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,290
我這兒沒有
It's not here.

496
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,600
如果Schrader能找到 我們也能找到
Well,if schrader can find it,so can we.

497
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,150
這人得是Schrer的朋友 那他們應該是同年
The guy needed to be schrer's friend, so they're probably around the same age.

498
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,400
查一下90年代早期的學院畢業生名單
Look forcademy graduates in the early nineties.

499
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,670
好的
Ok.

500
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,170
有沒有什麼人沒有進警察局工作?
Did any of them not go into police work?

501
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,640
寶貝 我聽不懂了
Baby,i don't follow you.

502
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,810
如果他是臥底 就要斷絕 和學院有關的任何聯繫
If he we undercover, then anything tied to the academy would have to be severed.

503
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,720
這人畢了業 就要馬上 以Joey Short的身份開始工作
I mean,the guy graduated, be he had to immediately start working his history as joey short.

504
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,350
他混進吸毒聚會 和銀行劫犯取得聯繫
He went into cstruction, made his contacts in the bank robbery world,

505
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,120
然後他認識了Schrader 贏得他的信任
And then he met schrader, earned schrader's trust,

506
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,850
把他送進監獄以後就全身而退
And then turned him in and got out of the game.

507
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,770
好了 有幾個人中途退出了
Ok. Here's a couple of guys look like theyropped out.

508
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,620

That is joe mulr. He has a wife and 2 kids.

512

That's definitely the guy. Where is he now?

513
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,240

516
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,800
- Molly和孩子們呢? - 很好 他們都很好
- Molly,the kids? - Good. They're good.

517
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,200
- 你來這幹嘛? - 呃 你知道的 辦案子
- What are you doing he? - Just,uh,you know,work

518
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,890
- 呃 他們是不是開除你了? - 是的 夫人
- Uh,they stopped paying you,didn't they?

519
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,310
別跟我"夫人""夫人"地瞎客氣 你有什麼需要?
Don't you ma'am me. What do you need?

520
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,640
- 嗯...5分鐘就好? - 沒問題
- Just,uh,5 minutes? - You got it.

521
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,790
你最好了
You're the best.

522
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,310
好的謝了 Muller不在家 家堥S人
Ok,thanks. Muller's not at home. No one is.

523
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,460
他妻子沒去上班 孩子昨天和今天都沒去學校
His wife didn't show up at work, the kids weren't at school yesterday or today.

524
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,450
Schrader很可能抓了他們當人質
Schrer probably has them hostage.

525
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,870
- 是啊 但在哪呢? - Joe Muller能為他做什麼呢?
- Yeah,but whe? - What could joe muller for him?

526
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,590
他能幫他拿到的東西 就只有錢了
The only thing that's left. He can get him the moy.

527
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,900
- 好吧 根本就沒人知道它在哪 - Schrader知道
- Well,no one even knows where it is. - Schrader knows.

528
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,480
這些傢伙把錢藏在哪呢?
Where do these guys hide money?

529
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,250
某個安全的地方
Someplace safe.

530
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,660
他會膽子那麼大敢把 錢藏到保管箱媔?
Would he be bold enough to hide it a safe deposit box?

531
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,390
大盜把錢存銀行? 是啊 也許吧
A thief using a bank? Yeah,maybe.

532
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,210
Schrader不能進銀行 到處都有通緝他的圖像
Schrader can't walk into a bank. His face is everywhere.

533
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,450
要是Muller走進去 是沒有人會在意的
No one would think twice if muller walked in.

534
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,650
他必須得有鑰匙
He'd have to have a key.

535
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,760
Schrader一案的物證都在哪?
Where's the physical evidence from the schrader case?

536
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,840
不在我們手堣F
We don't have it.

537
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,180
好吧 如果我們可以想出Schrader把 錢藏在哪 我們就會知道他要去哪堣F
Well,if we can figure out where schrader hid the money, we'll know where he's going.

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,210
希爾克雷斯特大道2839號

545
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,140
希爾克雷斯特? 你把他們放在城?

546

不 我的錢在那

00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,080
然後呢? 這就永遠不會結束對吧?
Then what? This is never gonna end,is it?

- 看看他 她已經氣壞了 - 別殺他
- Ook at her. She's pissed. - Don't kill him.

So he hid a family where no one hrs them call for help.

什麼也沒
Nothing.

597
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,840
讓我幫你把安全帶扣好
Let me get your seatbelt in.

598
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,250
我們的日程每天都是一樣的
Our routine's the same every day.

599
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,270
孩子們8:15必須到校 然後Molly去上班
The kids have to be at school by 8:15, then molly heads to work.

She didn't make it to either yesterday. What was her route?

- Is that route isolated during the morning commute? - No.

603
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,410
如果他在監視 有很大可能 她根本沒能把車開出車道
If he was watching, there's a good chance she never left the driveway.

604
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,820
我先開車走了
I drove out first.

605

開車
Drive.

He told me how for 11 years he'd been trying to figure out how he got locked up.

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,330
他知道Otey出賣了他搶劫的事 但那還不足以把他關那麼久
He knew otey had ratted him out for the robbery, but that wasn't enough to put him away.

612
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,390
他說 搞不清楚的一點 就在我身上
He said I was the piece that didn't fit.

613
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,600
- 他明白了我是個警察 - 然後他綁架了你的家人
- He figured out I was a cop. - And he took your family.

You help me, your family lives. You don't,they die.

617
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,910

I told you,there'll be more when it's over.

I got some people helping and they don't want to wait.

622
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,560
