Darrin Call

Oh,i don't have anything. No,no,no. I've got a refill left.

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,080
還好嗎?

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,260
天啊! 哦 天啊!
God! Oh,my god!

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,640
哦 天啊 你還撐得住嗎?
Oh,my god, are you all right?

00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,530
看看你都幹了些什麼!
Look what you've done!

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,790
快來人幫幫他
Please,somebody help him!

22
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,060
趕緊把刀放下
Put the knife down,now.

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,050
他還沒來
He's not in yet.

24
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,300
什麼?
What?

25
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,720
你在Hotch辦公室前晃了一小時了
You've been walking past hotch's office for an hour.

26
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,680
Emily去接他了
Emily's picking him up.

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,860
Hotch告我說他已經可以開車了
Hotch told me he was cleared to drive.

28
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,220
的確是這樣 但她想接他
He is. She wants to do it.

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,620
怎麼了?
What's going on?

30
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,580
Rossi 他剛休了一個月
He's only had a month off, rossi.

31
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,560
準確地講是34天
Technically,34 days.

32
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,910
你覺得足夠長嗎?
And you think that's long enough?

33
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,170
你覺得不夠? 那跟他說去
You don't? Tell him.

34
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,400
還是算了 我挺喜歡我工作的
No,thanks. I like my job.

35
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,740
你更喜歡他啊
You like him more.

36
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,500
他要是得了應激障礙綜合癥怎麼辦?
What if he's got ptsd?

37
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,830
他已經做過評估了
He was evaluated.

38
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,450
少來了 Rossi 那些題都是咱出的
Come on,rossi, we wrote those questions.

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,110
Hotch知道怎麼去答
Hotch knows exactly how to answer them.

40
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,710
那我們該怎麼辦? 對他做的一切都吹毛求疵?
So what are you gonna do, pick apart everything he does?

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,460
他應該離職多久? 一年? 兩年?
How long should he be gone? A year? 2?

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,910
只要Foyet逍遙法外一天 Hotch就算是輸了 你知道
Every day that foyet is out there,hotch loses, and you know that.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,430
知道會讓Hotch怎樣嗎?
You know what that makes hotch?

44
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,800
注意力不集中
Distracted.

45
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,550
更有動力
Motivated.

46
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,230
Derek
Derek.

47
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,970
他回來是因為他必須這麼做
He's coming back because he has to.

48
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,620
他得知道我們是支持他的
He needs to know we've got his back.

49
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,360
他知道的
He knows that.

50
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,080
那就別讓他忘了
Then we don't let him forget it.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,740
謝謝 痛嗎?
Thanks. Does it hurt?

52
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,400
只有想了才疼 可我老在想
It really only hurts when i think about it, which is pretty much all the time.

53
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,670
不 不 不 你別動
No,no,no.Get away,you. What?

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,830
這是給Hotch的
These are for hotch.

55
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,780
我的腿中槍了都不能吃曲奇哦
I get shot in the leg and i don't get any cookies.

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,490
你知道他不喜歡過度關心
You know he's gonna hate the attention.

57
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,540
這是曲奇 不是蛋糕
It's cookies,not cake.

58
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,770
反正估計他會裝作什麼都沒發生
He's probably gonna pretend like nothing happened,anyway.

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,230
但不意味著咱也得裝
Well,it doesn't mean we have to.

60
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,010
也許應該像平常一樣
I think maybe we should.

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,340
我不會這麼做的
I don't roll that way.

62
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,360
我一直在想
I've been thinking about it?

63
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,480
自從我認識Hotch以來 好像就沒見他眨過眼
The entire time i've known hotch, i don't think i've ever seen him blink.

64
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,210
是哦 很怪
I know. It's weird.

65
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,120
典型大男子主義者行為
Classic alpha male behavior.

66
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,020
你說他是不是把Foyet瞪怕了?
Do you think he stared down foyet?

67
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,620
也許吧 能救他的話
Maybe. If it would save his life.

68
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,210
你說他是不是一直盯著看 每一刀都盯著
Do you think he stared the whole time, like with each stab?

69
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,220
我不知道
I have no idea.

70
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,200
他還好嗎?
Is he ok?

71
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,540
換我肯定好不了 但...咱愛眨眼
I wouldn't be,but... I'm a blinker.

72
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,410
Spence 你在這啊 帶上你的包 發生什麼事了?
Spence,there you are. Grab your go bag. What's going on?

73
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,710
看看新聞
Turn on the news.

74
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,660
哪個台 隨便
Which one? It doesn't matter.

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,170
今晨8時剛過 一名叫Darrin Call的 40歲路易維爾當地居民
Just after 8:00 this morning, 40yearold darrin call, a lifelong resident of louisville,

76
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,850
襲擊了主道和特拉斯頓大道 拐角處藥房的顧客
assaulted customers at the pharmacy on the corner of main and truxton avenues.

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,560
目擊者稱襲擊後他朝大街東邊走去
Eyewitnesses saw him walking east on main street minutes after the attack.

78
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,520
自此再沒人見過他
He has not been seen since then.

79
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,540
我們要去路易維爾
We're going to louisville.

80
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,480
他身穿藍色襯衫 牛仔褲和淺灰外套
He was wearing a blue shirt,jeans, and a lightgray jacket.

81
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,850
政府當即召集各方追捕
Within the hour,the governor has called in all sources for a manhunt.

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,590
儘管全州追捕 嫌犯仍避開執法人員
Despite these statewide efforts, the suspect has eluded law enforcement.

83
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,340
傷亡人數正在上升
The body count is rising.

84
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,960
三人確認死亡 包括一名持槍 銀行保安 其槍支用於襲擊
3 are confirmed deadincluding an armed bank guard whose gun was used in the attack.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,300
另外兩人仍傷勢危險
Another 2 remain in critical condition.

86
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,610
襲擊者尚未抓獲
The assailant is still out there.

87
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,490
我們將鏡頭交給Eric Jennings 他採訪了路易維爾居民...
We are going back to eric jennings who's been talking to residents of louisville

88
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,810
肯塔基州這案子瞭解多少了?
what do we know about this case in kentucky?

89
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,760
Call和受害人並無聯繫
Uh,there's no connection between call and his victims.

90
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,740
路易維爾警方搜查了該市 但他離開藥店後就沒有蹤跡了
Louisville p.D.'S covered the city, but there hasn't been any sign of him since he left the pharmacy.

91
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,060
查過他家了 家人?
You check his house,family?

92
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,870
當地警方在查
Locals are on it.

93
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,490
從最近經歷查起 找到刺激他的事
Start with his most recent history. Find the stressor.

94
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,110
別動
Uh,don't move.

95
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,520
準備好了? 你呢?
Ready? Are you?

96
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,590
我們在路易維爾的負責人 叫Kevin Mitchell
So our point person in louisville is lieutenant kevin mitchell.

97
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,510
早上好
Good morning.

98
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,370
高興見到你 一樣
Good to see you. You,too.

99
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,120
氣色不錯 謝謝
You look well,sir. Thank you.

100
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,630
要架多久?
How long do you have that?

101
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,860
不知道 歡迎回來 謝謝
I'm not really sure. Welcome back. Thank you.

102
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,930
有再次傷人嗎?
Any other attacks?

103
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,520
沒 還沒有 Call很難找
Um,no,not yet. Call's proven hard to track.

104
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,580
他沒有駕照 很可能還用走的
He's never had a driver's license, so he's most likely still on foot.

105
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,320
或公共交通工具
Or public transportation.

106
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,620
他不會坐公車的 到處都是他的照片
He's not gonna take the bus. His face is everywhere.

107
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,900
找到刺激他的事了嗎?
Has anyone found a stressor?

108
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,170
剛丟了工作 90年起就在一工廠幹活
He just lost his job. He's worked at a factory since 1990.

109
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,850
一直做器具 但從沒升過職
Made appliances since forever and not a single promotion.

110
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,030
現在才懷恨有點太久了
That's a long time to be bitter.

111
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,350
或者說他不在乎
Or he doesn't care.

112
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,790
要是有家人要養就不會
Not if he's got a family to feed.

113
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,630
實際上 他過隱居生活 據我所知 他沒有親人
Actually, he's of the hermit variety. As far as i can tell, he's got no one.

114
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,820
沒妻子 沒孩子 沒父母 生活沒什麼盼頭
No wife,no kids, no parents. Nothing to live for.

115
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,290
那他為什麼還沒自殺?
So why hasn't he killed himself yet?

116
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,920
這種太自由的人通常會自殺
Sprees usually end in suicide.

117
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,900
要是他活著沒盼頭 怎麼還不了結?
If he's got nothing to live for, why hasn't he ended it?

118
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,360
因為他還有沒做完的事 我們知道他表露出了憤怒
'Cause he isn't finished yet. We know he has displaced anger.

119
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,990
怒氣撒在第一個受害者身上
He took it out on the first victim.

120
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,610
理貨員代表著什麼人 我們得查清是誰
Well,the stock boy represents someone. We need to know who.

121
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,510
他參過軍嗎? 沒有
Is he military? Negative.

122
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,600
他發火捅人肯定有原因的
Well,he's lashing out for a reason.

123
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,350
這傢伙憤怒 有著無盡的目標 還拿著槍 他才剛剛開始呢
This guy's got anger, endless targets,and a gun, and he's just getting started.

艾米莉·狄金森寫到 "無需親臨幽室便能體味精神折磨
Emily dickinson wrote, "one need not be a chamber to be haunted.

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,650
無需親臨暗宅
"one need not be a house.

127
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,290
思想能帶你穿越置身其中"
The brain has corridors surpassing material place."

128
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,860
好了
all right.

129

We've got checkpoints at the state line on both i64 and i65

130
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,420
市區20里半徑內都設了檢查站
and within a 20mile radius of downtown.

131
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,340
我們認為他仍在步行
We think he's still on foot.

132
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,560
不到三個小時 按照每小時2.5英里步速計算
It's been just under 3 hours with an average walking speed of 2.5 miles per hour,

133
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,210
差不多在半徑8英里的範圍內
which rounds up to an approximate 8mile radius.

134
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,520
目前我們集中檢查這
Now,we've concentrated here.

135
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:42,890
第一反應隊開始搜查 8英里內的商戶和住戶
First responders started a hardtarget search of businesses and residences within that 8 miles.

136
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,870
你們也要加入他們 你們知道他長什麼樣子
You're gonna join 'em. You know what he looks like.

137
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,780
去找到他
Go find him.

138
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,950
我們查了Darrin Call一切能查的
We dug up all we could on darrin call.

139
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,330
還去了他公寓 沒什麼發現
Even went to his apartment. Didn't find much.

140
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,620
我們的探員過去了
We've got agents over there now.

141
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,840
別擔心 會有所發現的 你們什麼策略?
Don't worry, we'll fill it in. What's your strategy?

142
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,030
我們要弄清楚他接下來去哪
We try to figure out where he's headed next.

143
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,680
你們有水晶球?
You got a crystal ball?

144
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,890
大多自由殺手表面都很挑釁
Most spree killers are outwardly aggressive.

145
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,740
我們研究了Call的行為 而他不好鬥
We've studied call's behavior, and he's defensive.

146
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,000
第一名受害者 理貨員
First victimstock boy.

147
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,260
好傢伙 這還不好鬥呢
Boy,there's nothing defensive about that.

148
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,900
事實上是的 他被人碰了之後 才做出反應的
Actually,there is. Call doesn't react until he's touched.

149
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,600
是這讓他突然爆發的?
And that's what set him off?

150
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,890
每次都這樣 接觸 捅人 接觸 捅人
Happens every time. Contact,then stab, contact,stab.

151
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,690
你是說他並非有意傷害這些人?
So you're saying he didn't mean to hurt these people.

152
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,120
他進去的時候沒帶武器
He didn't go in there with a weapon.

153
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,050
他現在有兩把了
Well,now he's got 2.

154
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,870
我在新聞堣膚G他照片了
I just put his face all over the news.

155
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,940
人們會阻止他的
People are gonna stop him themselves.

156
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,840
我們什麼時候能開發佈會?
How soon can we have a press conference?

157
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,590
攝影組都已經在外面了
The camera crews are out front.

158
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,890
太好了 我打電話給Hotch 他是誰?
Great. Let me call hotch. Who's that?

159
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,250
我們的主管 他已經到犯罪現場了
Our supervisor. He's at the crime scene already.

160
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,820
這個孩子怎麼了?
What is it about this kid?

161
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,920
這就是我們想知道的
That's what we need to figure out.

162
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,210
Call的公寓離藥店5分鐘的路
Call's apartment is 5 minutes from the pharmacy,

163
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,540
但沒有他回來清洗血跡的跡象
but there's no sign that he came here to wash off that blood.

164
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,850
那他還滿身是血的在街上?
How's he still on the street, looking like that?

165
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,130
也許沒有
Maybe he's not.

166
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,460
Garcia說他沒有親人 那他能去哪?
Garcia said he's got nobody. Where would he go?

167
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,120
Call起床 疊好被子
Call gets up,he makes his bed.

168
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,650
確定他沒當過兵嗎?
We're sure he wasn't military?

169
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,500
房子看來是很整潔 也許住院接受過治療 我問問Garcia
It looks like one neat aspect. Maybe he was hospitalized. I'll call garcia.

170
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,880
那他生活也許很有規律
Then he's probably got the same routine every day.

171
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,340
除了今天
Except today.

172
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,310
他吃完麥片 走到藥店殺了3個人
He finished his cereal, walked to the pharmacy, and killed 3 people.

173
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,400
為什麼?
Why?

174
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,750
Call先生一般很少說話
Mr. Call was always so quiet.

175
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,900
他來這買東西好幾年了
He's been coming here for years.

176
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,640
他和理貨員有過爭執嗎?
Had he ever had a runin with the stock boy?

177
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,770
John是新來的 我招手叫他過來
John was new here. I waved him over.

178
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,300
我不知道該怎麼做 沒別人幫我了
I didn't know what else to do. No one else was helping.

179
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,390
你給了他處方後他才發狂的?
He didn't turn violent until you gave him his prescription?

180
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,970
那不是他的處方
Well,it wasn't his.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
你給了他一袋
You handed him a bag.

182
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,370
那是別人的 我只是希望他能冷靜下來
It was somebody else's. I just wanted him to calm down.

183
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,540
JJ說發佈會5分鐘後開始
Jj's press conference is in 5 minutes.

184
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,500
Hotch 可能會有新發現 你為什麼不把他自己的藥給他?
Hotch,we might have something else here. Why didn't you give him his own medication?

185
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,160
他的藥已經用完了
Well,he didn't have any refills left.

186
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,500
什麼藥? 阿普唑侖(抗焦慮藥)
For what? Uh,alprazolam.

187
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,350
但他以前是用安定藥的
But,uh,he used to be on thiothixene.

188
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,240
他在用抗精神病藥物?
He was on an antipsychotic?

189
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,000
所以我才想讓他冷靜下來
Well,that's why i wanted him to calm down.

190
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,310
你說以前 他多久沒吃過這些藥了?
You said he used to be. How long has he been off of them?

191
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,690
至少一個月
At least a month.

192
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,510
你準備什麼時候才告訴我們?
And when were you gonna tell us this?

193
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,630
他有武器 神志不清 他的醫生是誰?
He's armed, he's delusional. Who's his doctor?

194
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,350
不記得了 我的電腦 真夠好的
I don't remember. My computer. Great.

195
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,420
對不起 真是太好了
I'm sorry. Great.

196
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,680
對不起 Hotch
Excuse us. Hotch.

197
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,680
告訴JJ藥的事 這不是她的錯
Call jj and tell her about the meds. This is not her fault.

198
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,040
Morgan 他精神病犯了 這就完全不同了
Morgan,he's in a psychotic break. It changes everything.

199
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,850

You want to talk about this? No! I want to find him.

200
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,360
Garcia 他一個月沒吃精神抑製藥了
Garcia, he's been off his antipsychotic for a month.

201
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,030
你還漏掉了什麼?
What else did you miss?

202
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,450

You want to remember. It's why you're off the pills.

263
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,230
Garcia 拜託 今天別開玩笑 我知道 是這樣的
Come on, not today,garcia. I know. Here's the deal.

264
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,710
我漏掉抗精神病藥後... 聽我說 這不是你的錯
When i missed the antipsychoticslisten to me.That was not your fault.

265
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,860
你總護著我 親愛的 但我覺得是
You are ever my champion,sugar, but i believe it was.

266
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,920
不管了 我漏掉了 於是又從頭查 但是根本沒有頭
Anyway,when i did that, i went back to the beginning for call,except there is no beginning.

267
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,840
等等 Rossi
Wait a minute. Rossi.

268
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,080
再說一次 你在說什麼?
Say that again. What are you talking about?

269
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,770
Darrin Call從1969年到1975年不存在
Darrin call didn't exist like from 1969 to 1975.

270
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,460
沒有出生證明 沒社保 沒身份 什麼都沒有 直到他6歲
There's no birth certificate, no social security, no identity,nothing, until he was 6 years old.

271
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,260
他被父母拋棄了?
Was he abandoned?

272
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,020
我最不喜歡的三個字不知道
My least 3 favorite words strung togetheri don't know.

273
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,600
我猜他自己也不知道
My guess is neither does he.

274
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,620
我該從錄像媯o現他眨眼的
I should have seen the blinking on the video.

275
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,000
可能只是緊張抽筋呢
Well,it could have been a nervous tic.

276
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,710
但不是 是長期服用抗精神病藥 的典型癥狀 而我忽略了
But it wasn't. It's a classic sign of longterm antipsychotic use, and i missed it.

277
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,320
我們都忽略了
We all did.

278
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,580
不管怎樣 他們死了
Well,regardless, those men died.

279
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,380
Garcia有發現
Garcia's got something.

280
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,330
1975年5月1日 6歲的Darrin Call 在偏僻的地方流浪 被人發現並帶走
May 1,1975, a 6yearold darrin call was found roaming in the middle of nowhere and was picked up

281
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,840
最開始幾個月在孤兒院
and was in state care for the first few months.

282
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,640
他告訴警察發生什麼事了嗎
Did he tell the cops what happened?

283
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,100
沒有 因為他一年多都沒說話
No. Because he didn't talk, not for over a year.

284
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,910
而當他開口說話時 就只知道Darrin Call這個身份了
And once he started talking, he only knew his life as darrin call.

285
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,690
太可憐了 接下來也是
That's awful. So is this.

286
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,570
小Darrin從沒被人認領
Little darrin was never claimed.

287
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,720
也許他不是那一帶的人
Maybe he wasn't from the area.

288
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,970
1975年還沒有完善的失蹤兒童系統
There wasn't a thriving missing children's network in 1975.

289
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,360
Call穿著Cipolla的衣服
Call is wearing cipolla's clothing.

290
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,340
你認為他頭腦清醒的?
You think he's lucid?

291
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,480
不 很可能他只是嚇壞了
No,mostly likely he's just freaked out.

292
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,180
不管怎樣 我們應該告知公眾最新消息
Either way,we should update the public.

293
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,830
你也應該去
You should be there,too.

294
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,470
這是什麼? Call的時間表
What is this? Call's timeline.

295
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,730
他離開路易斯維爾? 3次
He left louisville? 3 times.

296
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,360
總是回到那10個街區內? 為什麼?
Always came back to the same 10block radius. Why?

297
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,160
受害人總會被最初受傷的地方吸引
Victims are often drawn to the scene of their first trauma.

298
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,890
他既想逃離 又掙扎著想找到答案
Part of him wanted to escape, the other part probably struggled to find answers.

299
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,340
他住院治療過嗎?
Was he hospitalized?

300
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,680
1985年 治了2年
Uh,1985 for 2 years.

301
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,680
沒錯 然後95年也有幾個月 都在費耶特縣的公共醫院
Yeah. And again in '95 for a few months, both at the state facility in fayette county.

302
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,760
你們知道他不會開車
You know he doesn't drive.

303
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,700
難道他會自己走過去嗎?
You think he'd walk all the way out there?

304
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,570
他不顧一切 會找到方法的
He's desperate. He'll find a way.

305
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,940
那我告訴費耶特的警長
Well,then i'll tell the sheriff in fayette.

306
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,680
他什麼時候開始服藥的?
When did he start the prescriptions,garcia?

307
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,810
1977年 似乎什麼藥都吃過了 我找到一張清單
In 1977,and it looks like he tried them all. I've got a list.

308
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,810
按字母順序 阿普唑侖 氯硝西泮 安定...
Alphabetically,alprazolam, clonazepam,diazepam

309
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,640
發給我 是
just send it. Yes,sir.

310
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,640
醫生讓他停藥肯定有理由的
His doctor weaned him off the prescription for a reason.

311
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,470
風險很大 肯定是為了更有利的事
Now,that's a big risk, so the reward must have been greater.

312
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,320
他要知道真相
He needs the truth.

313
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,520
他拿走了他的檔案 找到了些答案
He took his file. He's got some answers.

314
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,810
讓他搶先一步
And a head start.

315
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,690
那我們就追上他
Well,we need to catch up.

316
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,800
傷疤/創傷
<i>SCARS / TRAUMA</i>

317
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,910
意識喪失
<i>BLACKOUTS</i>

318
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,570
遺棄/忽視
<i>ABANDONMENT / NEGLECT</i>

319
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,340
兒童服務機構記錄到 他受到嚴重的虐待
Records from child services has him extremely physically abused.

320
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,860
沒有性暴行的跡象
No signs of sexual assault.

321
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,150
這是個奇跡
That's a miracle.

322
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,870
不管怎樣 創傷使他身體虛弱
Either way,the trauma was debilitating.

323
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,060
他是為了逃離家庭虐待還是綁架?
Was he running from an abusive home or an abduction?

324
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,710
如果是誘拐會沒有記錄嗎?
Wouldn't there be a paper trail if it were a kidnapping?

325
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
Garcia 查一下1970年後 未偵破的兒童失蹤案
Garcia,look for unsolved missing children's cases from the 1970s.

326
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,170
谷溪鎮有個案子
Now,there was a case in hollow creek.

327
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,340
但被綁的孩子都死了 屍體不完整
Kids were dead,though. Found them in pieces.

328
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,890
什麼時候的事? 1975年
When was this? '75.

329
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,740
沒人說起這事 因為沒找到兇手
Nobody talks about it 'cause they never found the guy.

330
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,380
你覺得Call是這案子的生還者?
You think call walked away from that?

331
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,160
有可能 Garcia 資料發給我 好了
It's possible. Garcia,send me everything. Done.

332
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,240
你能找到案子資料嗎?
Can you find the case file?

333
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,340
我盡力
I'll do what i can.

334
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,310
You're it! Come on,wait up!

335
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,620
有嫌犯名單嗎?
Is there a suspect list?

336
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,760
就在這堶
It's in here somewhere.

337
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,980
他被稱為谷溪鎮殺手
He was known as the hollow creek killer.

338
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,160
發現3具屍體 有些未證明身份
3 bodies were found, some never identified.

339
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,010
天哪 他用石灰處理...
Oh,god,he used lime to dispose

340
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,450
有一個倖存者 Call?
there's a survivor. Call?

341
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,720
不 一個叫Tommy Phillips的12歲男孩
No,a 12yearold boy named tommy phillips.

342
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,080
父母說他失蹤了兩星期 回來後大不一樣了
Parents said he'd been missing for 2 weeks, came back a different kid.

343
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,050
那是肯定
Of course he did.

344
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,280
Tommy告訴警察屍體位置後 他們全家就離開了路易斯維爾
Let's see. The family left louisville after tommy told police where to find the bodies.

345
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:15,740
他還說嫌犯是30多歲的白人 開一輛紅色輕型卡車
He also said the suspect was a white man in his 30s and drove a red pickup truck.

346
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,060
我們得找到Tommy
We need to find tommy.

347
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,490
他現在46歲了
He'd be 46 now.

348
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,810
他父母可能給他改了名字 有多遠走多遠了
His parents probably changed his name and got as far away as possible.

349
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,000
Garcia能找到他
Garcia can find him.

350
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,150
別抱太大希望了
Don't get your hopes up.

351
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,290
Garcia 查Tommy Philips的所有資料
Garcia, everything you can find on a tommy phillips.

352
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,490
受害人身上有刀痕
The victims had cuts.

353
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,200
是藥店理貨員的小刀刺激了他
The stock boy's blade is what set him off in the pharmacy.

354
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,330
如果Call是在逃避這個 也難怪他會封閉這些記憶
If this is what call's been running from, it's no wonder he's blocked it out.

355
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,800
現在停藥了 他的記憶就甦醒了 他想討個答案
Since he's clean now, there's no medication to block his memories and he wants answers.

356
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,700
他會去哪呢?
Where would he go?

357
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,800
去他知道的地方
To what he knows.

358
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,330
他什麼都不知道 這才是問題
He doesn't know anything. That's the problem.

359
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,520
他正在慢慢恢復記憶
He's beginning to.

360
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,930
1975年 Sterner孤兒院
1975,sterner orphanage.

361
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,280
那是他成為Darrin Call的地方
It's where he became darrin call.

362
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,740
找誰?
Yes?

363
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,800
這兒有個好人 Cureton先生
There was a nice man here,mr. Cureton.

364
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,190
我要見他
I need to see him.

365
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,920
不好意思 他幾年前就退休了
I'm sorry, he retired years ago.

366
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,600
那他去了哪? 我也不知道 對不起
Well,where did he go? I don't know.I'm sorry

you gotta know! Hehe didn't just leave.

368
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,560
對不起 先生 可我說了 他不在這
I'm sorry,sir, but i told you, he's not here.

369
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,230
過來 孩子們 做作業了! 過來 來
Come on,kids,homework! Come on. Come on.

他在這兒
He's here.

374
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,180
他在這兒 誰? 你說什麼呢?

沒人在這 他在這 我剛...
Nobody's here. He's here.I just

376

Come on,you can make it! Come on! Come on,come on!

378

Tommy Tommy 我們得離開這
Tommy,tommy, we gotta go.

379
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,070

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,090
他管那孩子叫Tommy
He called the boy tommy.

384
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,280
這是刺激他的誘因?
Is that what set him off?

385
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,410
她覺得是他倒影刺激的
She thought it was his reflection.

386
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,790
多年前傷害他的人 可能和他現在差不多大
Whoever hurt him years ago might have been the same age he is now.

387
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,960
他可能看到了相同點
He might have seen the similarity.

388
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,270
那孩子什麼狀況?
What about the boy?

389
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,900
真名叫Ryan 她說是個安靜順從的孩子
His real name is ryan. She said he's quiet and submissive.

390

Morgan有沒有從其他目擊者那 得到什麼信息?
Is morgan getting anything out of the other witness?

391
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,550
還沒
Not yet.

392
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,390
離這一個街區 有輛小貨車被偷了
A minivan was stolen one block from here.

393
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,040
Call從來沒開過車
Call's never driven in his life.

394
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,020
你還認為他不是躲避我們嗎?
You think he's still not running from us?

395
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,480
走的哪條路? 向東那條
Which way? Eastbound.

396
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,230
我在附近都布下了路障
I got roadblocks set up everywhere.

397
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,250
他跑不出這個縣
He's not getting out of this county.

398
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,200
你這是在浪費時間
You're wasting your time.

399
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,240
他們才兩個人
He's outnumbered.

400
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,370
你覺得他能就這麼憑空消失?
You think he's gonna just disappear?

401
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,600
我認為他帶走孩子是有原因的
I think he took the boy for a reason.

402
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,060
我才不管他為什麼帶走那孩子
I don't care why he took him.

403
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,660
你應該關心一下 Call的記憶已經釋放了
You should. Call's memory is no longer suppressed.

404
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,990
他在重建過去 除非我們弄懂 否則他們倆我們誰也找不到
He's reinventing his past, and unless we understand how, we're not gonna find either of them.

405
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,800
我可不會就這麼乾坐著瞎猜
Well,i'm not gonna just sit around and speculate.

406
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,690
那就別
Then don't.

407
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,080
你也認為我們不該去追他們?
You don't think we should chase him either?

408
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,820
我們得趕在Call前面
We need to get ahead of call.

409
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,770
現在可失蹤了一個孩子
There's a kid missing.

410
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,420
他們不需要人手
They don't need the extra manpower.

411
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,740
怎麼會?
Since when?

412
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:42,340
要是研究過Foyet最初的罪行 就該知道沒道理留倖存者
If we'd studied foyet's initial crimes, we would have known that a survivor didn't make sense.

413
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,380
他跟這案子有什麼關係?
What does he have to do with this?

414
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,180
我們要做的不過是放慢腳步 審視Foyet的過去 卻沒做到
All we had to do was stop and look at foyet's history, and we didn't,

415
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,560
導致很多無辜的人喪生
and we lost two couples and a bus full of people.

416
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,930
我不會再犯錯誤了
And i'm not making that mistake again.

417
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,160
他們會找到我們的 在哪? 你看見他了? 哪呢?
They're gonna find us. Where? You saw 'em? Where?

418
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,680
誰? 你在哪看到他了?
Who? Where did you seem 'em?

419
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,380
誰? 你在哪看到他了? 在哪?
Who? Where did you see 'em? Where?

420
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,840
求求你 放了我吧
Please,just let me go.

421
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,850
對不起 Tommy
I'm sorry,tommy.

422
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:14,800
只要...我們只要...只要
Justwe just gottawe gottajustohhwe gotta

423
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,200
我們要快跑 因為他會抓住我們 我們要...要...
we gotta hurry,tommy, 'cause he's gonna get us and we justwe just gottauhh

424
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,380
都瞭解些什麼?
so what do we know?

425
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,760
谷溪鎮案只有四名嫌疑人 而且都死了
There were only 4 suspects in the hollow creek case and they're all dead.

426
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,920
孩子分別是73年 74年 75年被綁的
The kids were taken in 1973,'74,and '75.

427
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,530
都是在放學回家的路上
And all on the way home from school.

428
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,820
不一樣的校區
Different school districts.

429
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,180
他一直等著他們落單
He waited for them to be alone.

430
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,190
這需要耐心 他下午一定不上班
That takes patience. He must have had time off in the afternoons.

431
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
他住在學校附近或在附近工作
He lived or worked near the schools.

432
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,400
那可有的問了
That's a lot of doors to knock on.

433
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,750
你覺得Call會故地重遊嗎?
You think call's going back there?

434
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,540
可能性很大
I think there's a good chance.

435
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,110
我去通知Mitchell
I'll tell mitchell.

436
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,720
第二地點是哪?
Where's the secondary location?

437
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,980
他需要隱藏起來做他做的事
He needed seclusion to do what he did.

438
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,570
說吧 Garcia 我開免提了
Go ahead,garcia. You're on speaker.

439
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,350
我查到Tommy了 現在叫James Thomas Anderson
I found tommy. He goes by james thomas anderson now.

440
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,250
是本地人嗎?
Is he local?

441
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,520
是鄰鎮的 地址和資料正在發送
One county over. Address and bio are coming... Now.

442
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,990
謝謝 Garcia
Thanks,garcia.

443
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,350
Darrin Call和我有什麼關係?
What does darrin call have to do with me?

444
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,450
我們認為他是谷溪鎮謀殺案的倖存者
We think he survived the hollow creek murders.

445
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,490
沒人倖存下來
Nobody survived that.

446
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,360
你不就是
You did.

447
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,610
當時還有一個男孩 六歲
There was another boy. He was 6.

448
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,900
沒有
No,that's not true.

449
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,590
我們沒空跟你玩
We don't have time for this.

450
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,010
跟你說了 當時就我自己
I'm telling you, i was alone.

451
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,530
就像現在?
Just like now?

452
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,980
你什麼意思?
Excuse me?

453
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,870
你結過婚嗎?
Have you ever been married?

454
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,910
有女朋友嗎? 家人呢?
Any relationships? Any family?

455
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,180
這些又有什麼關係?
What does that have to do with anything?

456
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,780
還是你害怕也會拋棄他們?
Or are you afraid you'll abandon them,too?

457
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,530
還是因為你是個酒鬼?
Or was it because of your alcoholism?

458
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,470
我絕不想丟下孩子的
I would never leave a kid.

459
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,740
是他太愛哭了?
Did he cry too much?

460
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,670
還是他太慢了? 究竟為什麼? 你怎能丟下一個六歲的孩子?
Was he too slow? What was it? How could you leave a 6yearold all alone?

461
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,980
我那時才十二歲
I was only 12 years old.

462
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,130
他一直在服用藥物治療 那次抑制他記憶的創傷
He's been taking medications to deal with the trauma that suppressed his memories.

463
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,290
這種失憶是心理防禦在起作用
That kind of amnesia is a psychological defense.

464
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,800
他會希望自己永遠記不起的
He's gonna wish he never remembered.

465
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,020
我們知道你告訴了警察什麼
We know what you told the police.

466
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,290
我們想瞭解那個男孩
We need to know about the boy.

467
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,050
他從來不說話
He never talked.

468
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,030
嘿 小孩 嘿 小孩
Hey,kid. Hey,kid.

469
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,540
那老傢伙睡過去沒?
Is the old man passed out yet?

470
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,770
你夠得著那個嗎?
Can you reach those?

471
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,720
好 很好
Good. Good.

472
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,620
很好 好了 拿過來
Good. Ok. Please. Bring 'em here.

473
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,190
繼續 你能做到的
Go ahead,you can do it.

474
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,570
我們走 走!
Come on. Come on!

475
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,190
拿上鏟子
Grab the shovel.

476
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,780
給我過來! 不許掙扎!
Hey,come here! Quit struggling!

477
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,200
過來
Come here.

478
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,190
出來
Get out of there.

479
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,390
走 走啊!
Come on. Come on!

480
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,770
過來 你能做到的!
Come on,you can make it!

481
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,070
過來 你行的! 過來! 過來啊!
Come on,you can make it! Come on! Come on!

482
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,230
跑啊 Tommy! 跑啊! 跑 Tommy! 跑!
Go,tommy! Run! Go,tommy! Run!

483
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,460
跑啊 Tommy! 跑!
Go,tommy! Run!

484
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,140
在那之前 我從沒聽過他說話
I'd never heard his voice before.

485
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,140
他讓你跑
He told you to go.

486
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,160
他還是個孩子
He was a kid.

487
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,930
你也是
So were you.

488
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,330
Call沒有和你一起關在後面
Call wasn't in the back with you.

489
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,410
沒有 他待在小屋
No,he was in the cab.

490
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,740
他給你水喝 弄到鑰匙
He gave you water. Got the keys.

491
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,790
為什麼他沒被關起來?
Why wasn't he locked up?

492
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,410
也許Call不是受害者
Maybe call wasn't a victim.

493
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,000
Call的倒影
Call's reflection.

494
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,100
哦 天
Oh,god.

495
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,210
他的父親就是谷溪鎮殺手
His father was the hollow creek killer.

496
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,910
他自己的孩子? 怪不得沒人來領呢
His own kid? No wonder he was never claimed.

497
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,480
他要怎麼解釋孩子突然失蹤呢?
How did the father explain his son just disappeared?

498
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,720
可能說他跑了
Could have said he ran away.

499
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,920
那媽媽會上報失蹤的啊
The mother would have reported him missing.

500
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,780
或許他說孩子死了
Maybe he said the boy died.

501
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,140
那她得辦葬禮啊
She'd want a funeral.

502
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,520
要是沒媽媽呢?
What if there wasn't one?

503
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,490
Morgan 打給Garcia 讓她查69年75年的死亡記錄
Morgan,call garcia. Ask her to check death records from 1969 to 1975.

504
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,720
查誰? 查母親
For who? For the mother.

505
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,850
跑啊 Tommy! 快跑! Tommy 快跑!
Go,tommy! Run! Go,tommy,run!

506
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,870
你以為你就沒事了? 你這麼想的?
You think you can get away? Is that what you think?

507
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,290
你個傻雜種
You stupid little bastard.

508
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,930
縮小範圍了嗎?
Have you narrowed it down?

509
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,370
6年時間太長了 再給我點特徵描述
Oh,6 years is a long time. I need more parameters.

510
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,480
她住在8英里半徑範圍內 已婚
She lived within that 8mile radius. She was married.

511
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,120
當年很可能是20多歲
She was most likely in her twenties.

512
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,060
他也許是她唯一的孩子 丈夫開一輛紅色卡車
He was probably her only kid. The husband drove a red truck.

513
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,500
好的 查到一個
Ok. This could be one.

514
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,450
Doris Jarvis 難產而死
Here we go,doris jarvis. Died in childbirth.

515
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,800
我猜猜 她生下一個男孩 對
And let me guessshe had a boy. Yeah.

516
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,320
寶貝兒 我開揚聲器 夥計們
Baby girl,i'm gonna put you on speaker. Guys.

517
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,860
Doris Jarvis嫁給了Bill Jarvis
Ok,so doris jarvis was married to bill jarvis.

518
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,460
他在市區外有一家機修店
He owned a machine shop just outside the city.

519
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,340
可能是第二地點
That could be the secondary location.

520
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,710
1980關門 從此什麼都沒做過 我猜他是低調行事
It closed in 1980. He hasn't done anything since. I guess he laid low.

521
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,390
他有輛紅色輕卡 直到76年 他買了輛黑的
He had a red pickup until 1976 when he bought a black one.

522
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,390
我之所以知道 是因為 他因酒後駕車被捕時就開的這輛
I know that because that's what he was driving when he was arrested for duis.

523
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,130
77到80年坐牢 現在就發他照片過去
He was locked up from '77 to '80, and i'm sending his picture now.

524
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,390
這肯定就是Darrin Call的爸爸了
And that could certainly be darrin call's father.

525
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,710
Jarvis現在在哪?
Where's jarvis now?

526
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,970
老地方 希金斯大街1457號 走
In the same house. 1457 hitchens avenue. Let's go.

527
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,080
你回來晚了
you're late.

528
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,780
就知道你會回家
I knew you'd come home.

529
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,250
副隊長 孩子在堶 我們控制中
Lieutenant. The kid's in there. We've got this.

530
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,370
特警隊員在看守出口
Tactical teams are covering the exits.

531
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,770
要牽引Call的注意力
Call needs a distraction.

532
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,170
他注意力都在老爸身上 現在是
He's focused on the old man. For now.

533
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,300
但我們還是得找最安全的辦法 把孩子救出來
But we're gonna have to figure out the safest way to get that kid out.

534
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,270
後面有隊人馬 還有一隊在路上
I've got a team in the back and one on the way.

535
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,590
我們要悄悄潛入
We're going to infiltrate.

536
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,450
這麼做的話 會出人命的
You do that and someone else dies.

537
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,760
要麼是Call  要麼是兒童謀殺犯 選吧
Either call or a child murdererflip a coin.

538
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,150
不一定非得這樣
It doesn't have to end like that.

539
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,290
讓Jarvis認罪然後走人 Call也就有了自己的答案
We get a confession out of jarvis and he goes away, and call gets his answers.

540
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,370
不需要再死人了
No one else has to die.

541
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,410
Hotch Hotch
Hotch. Hotch.

542
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,390
Hotch! 他這是幹嘛呢?
Hotch! What the hell is he doing?

543
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,820
讓他去 Rossi 我可不能讓他一人進去
Let him go. Rossi,i'm not letting him go in there solo.

544
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,830
我們得信任他
We have to trust him.

545
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,880
我們可以一起來
We can do this together.

546
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,560
出去! 我叫Aaron
Get out! My name's aaron.

547
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,230
這是我倆跟他之間的事
This is between us and him.

548
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,950
我知道
I know.

549
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,390
那你就別多管閒事
Then you leave us alone.

550
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,540
我知道他對那些孩子做了什麼
I know what he did to those boys.

551
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,010
我知道谷溪鎮和籠子
I know about hollow creek and the cage.

552
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,110
還有Tommy
And tommy.

553
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,220
你知道Tommy?
You know about tommy?

554
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,890
快 你能行的 快點! 快!
Come on,you can make it! Come on! Come on!

555
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,020
我們要讓他償還他所做的一切 Tommy
We're gonna get him back for everything that he done,tommy.

556
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,580
每一件事
Every single thing.

557
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,930
放他走 無需讓Tommy看到這個
Let him go. Tommy doesn't need to see this.

558
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,360
他該去死
He should die.

559
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,800
是的 但殺掉他的話 你什麼都得不到
He should.But if you kill him, you have nothing,

560
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,390
我想你想要答案吧
and i thought you wanted some answers.

561
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,300
他在做什麼?
What's he doing?

562
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,300
拖延時間
Stalling.

563
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,220
他是放手一搏了
He's got nothing to lose.

564
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,520
來啊 Darrin 問他
Go ahead,darrin, ask him.

565
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,400
你為什麼那樣對孩子們?
Why did you do that to those kids?

566
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,780
什麼孩子? 別裝!
What kids? No!

567
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,790
我們埋掉那些 為什麼?
The ones that we buried. Why?

568
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,790
你腦袋糊塗了 沒有!
You're confused. No!

569
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,320
Jarvis 你幹嘛不搬走?
Jarvis,why didn't you move?

570
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,620
這是我家
This is my home.

571
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,620
真不是因為外面的景? Darrin 來
You sure it's not the view? Darrin,come here.

572
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,990
過來看看
Come take a look at this.

573
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,580
他每天坐在走廊上看孩子
He sits on the porch every day and watches those kids.

574
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,290
他控制不住自己
He can't help himself.

575
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,220
有射擊角度嗎?
You got the shot?

576
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,270
沒有
Negative.

577
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,800
該死 他在做什麼?
Damn it. What's he doing?

578
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,900
孩子出來了
Bringing the boy out.

579
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,700
咱把Hotch弄出來
Let's get hotch out of there.

580
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,780
他的決定
That's his call.

581
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,450
我們開著那卡車跑
Wewe drove around in that truck.

582
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,910
你讓自己兒子坐前排 好讓其他孩子感到安全?
You made your own son sit in front so the other boys would feel safe?

583
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,830
你...你把他們關籠子 我燒了他們的衣服
Youyou kept them in cages. I burnt their clothes.

584
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,710
等你完活了 就把他們埋了還讓他幫忙
And when you finished, you'd bury them and you made him help.

585
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,460
站起來 有點男人的樣子
get up. Pretend you're a man.

586
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,980
你喜歡小男孩 對吧?
You like little boys, don't you?

587
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,470
但也不能太小 因為那就不對了
But they can't be too small, 'cause that would be wrong.

588
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,450
他們有什麼特別? 讓你感到強大 感到像個男人?
What was it about them? They make you feel strong, make you feel like a man?

589
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,760
你閉嘴
You shut up.

590
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,450
是同意的意思嗎?
Is that a yes?

591
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,660
Darrin 這堻Q包圍了
Darrin. We're surrounded here.

592
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,470
警察隨時會突進這
The police are gonna storm in here any minute.

593
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,340
沒有武器的話 他們不會對你開槍
They will not shoot you if you are unarmed.

594
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,420
現在就把槍放下
You need to put the gun down now.

595
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,630
別...你別指使我!
Don'tdon'ttell me what to do!

596
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,590
別...
Don'tuhh

597
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,790
行動!
go,go!

598
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,730
怎麼了?
What happened?

599
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,530
我沒能阻止他
I couldn't stop him.

600
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,470
結束了 暫時結束
It's over. For now.

601
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,050
謝謝
Thank you.

602
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,620
我想你該跟那個人聊聊
There's someone i think you should talk to.

603
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,960
Tommy?
Tommy?

604
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,520
太對不起了
I'm so sorry.

605
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,340
為什麼?
What for?

606
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,690
我跑走了
For running away.

607
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,410
我們都跑了
We both ran.

608
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,030
是 但我把你丟下了
Yeah,but i left you behind.

609
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,420
他可能殺了你的
He could have killed you.

610
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,430
他沒有
He didn't.

611
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,180
因為我不再害怕他了
'Cause i wasn't afraid of him anymore.

612
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,410
你改變了一切 Tommy
You've changed everything,tommy.

613
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,830
我一直在等待你這麼個人
You're the one that i waited for.

614
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,850
是你救了我
You're the one that saved me.

615
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,840
"沒有可怕至極的證人 沒有恐怖之至的原告
"there is no witness so dreadful, "no accuser so terrible,

616
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,400
因為良心存在於每個人心中"
as the conscience that dwells in the heart of every man."

617
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,620
古希臘歷史學家 波堣顒
Polybius.

618
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,830
我知道你想說什麼
I know what you want to talk about.

619
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,880
兩個月前 我們不會打破Hotch的決定
2 months ago we wouldn't be breaking down hotch's decisions.

620
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,140
毫無疑問
There'd be no doubt.

621
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,260
兩個月前 他還有生活的盼頭 Rossi
2 months ago he had everything to live for,rossi.

622
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,790
現在他的家人都被帶走了
Now his family's just been taken away.

623
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,490
他要怎麼想其他的事?
How is he supposed to think about anything else?

624
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,180
他會讓Foyet贏多久?
How long is he gonna let foyet win?

625
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,360
我是說 咱抓到這傢伙的時候
I mean,come on, by the time we catch this guy,

626
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,580
Hotch內心的傷可能比外傷多得多
hotch could be more scarred on the inside than he is the outside.

627
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,250
Hotch冒了險 但我們救了那孩子
Hotch took a risk. But we saved that boy.

628
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,250
他冒了生命危險進去 我們絕不該這樣的 你知道
He put his life at risk in there, in ways that we are never supposed to,and you know it.

629
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,100
我可不打算待在一旁 看著他害死自己
I'm not about to stand by and watch this man kill himself.

630
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,040
你不會的
And you won't.

631
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,010
Rossi...
Rossi...

632
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,650
Hotch死了 Foyet就沒人可折磨了 那Hotch就贏了
If hotch is gone, foyet's got no one else to torture. Hotch wins.

633
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:09,140
但要是Hotch活著 卻無法看著兒子長大 那他就輸了
But if hotch lives but doesn't get to watch his son grow up, hotch loses.

634
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,580
你不用陪我上來的
You didn't have to walk me up here,you know.

635
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,310
我知道
I know.

636
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,230
你覺得Call會沒事嗎? 不知道
So you think call's gonna be ok? I don't know.

637
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,790
他找到答案了
He got his answers.

638
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,100
殺了那陰魂不散的人
He killed the man who haunted him.

639
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,360
還剩下什麼?
And what else is there?

640
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,350
遭折磨的日子
The years of torture.

641
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,480
覺得他能忘懷嗎? 怎麼會?
Think he'll get over that? How could he?

642
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,720
但至少不會再感覺孤獨無助了
But at least he doesn't have to feel like he's alone anymore.

643
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,820
他誰都沒有
He doesn't have anyone.

644
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,750
他有Tommy 他不是一個人
He has tommy. He's not alone.

645
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,560
睡會吧 你也是
Get some sleep. You,too.
