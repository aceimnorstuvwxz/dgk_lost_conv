維吉尼亞州 漢普頓
Hampton,virginia

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,620
這些實驗證明 有幾個要素非常明顯
now, from these experiments, A few factors became evident.

3
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,089
其中一個是 自有人類以來 連環殺手就已經存在於我們身邊
One was the realization That serial killers have been with us Since the dawn of man.

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,499
求你了 放他走吧
Please, let him go.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,119
什麼東西都給你 隨便拿
Take whatever you want, take anything,

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,289
求你放了我兒子吧
But please let my son go.

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,079
我是教授 名叫James Fallon
My name is professor james fallon.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,389
我是科學家 神經系統科學家
I'm a scientist-- neuroscientist--

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,330
我研究人類的腦部
And i study the human brain.

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,220
它是一個複雜 有時甚至可以致命的機器
It is a complex and sometimes lethal machine.

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,339
在一次"盲法"試驗 同事給了我70份MRI腦部掃瞄
In a blind experiment, colleagues sent me 70 mri brain scans,

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,849
而我完全不知道這些掃瞄是屬於哪個人
And i had no idea who these brains belonged to.

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,379
有些很正常 有的是精神分裂癥患者的
Some were normals, some were schizophrenics,

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,200
有的是殺手的
And some were killers.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,089
我把他們全部做分析
I analyzed all of them,

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,019
判斷其中5個是精神病患者的腦部
5 of which i determined were the brains of psychopaths.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,260
但事實上 這5個是知名連環殺手的腦部
And it turned out that, indeed, These 5 were the brains of serial killers, Some of whom you know.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,939
通過這類研究
In studies such as these,

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,949
研究這些生物學的要素
One looks at the biological factors...

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,189
既是遺傳學也是腦部病理學的範疇
That is, the genetics and also the brain pathology.

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,609
我們所鑒定的這5個腦部 額眶部皮質都有損傷
The 5 brains we identified All had damage to the orbital cortex,

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,219
也就是眼部上方的區域
Which is right above the eyes.

23
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,459
單胺氧化?的高危對偶基因
Now, high-risk allele of the monoamine oxidase a,

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,469
單胺氧化?a也許同樣存在於這些人的體內
The maoa gene May also be present in these people,

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,579
那就是關鍵
And that's key.

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,349
在高危基因的作用下
Now, under the effects of the high-risk gene,

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,419
精神病患者的腦部在胎兒發育過程中
The brain of the psychopath was bathed

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,639
浸泡了過多5-羥色胺
In way too much serotonin during fetal development.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,290
成人之後
As an adult,

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,170
腦部對5-羥色胺的鎮靜作用變得麻木
This brain is now numb To seratonin's calming effects.

31
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,410
於是最危險的要素已經到位
The first dangerous elements are now in place.

32
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,880
傷害已造成
The damage is done.

33
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,780
這就是產生災難的方法
Now, this is a recipe for catastrophe.

34
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,550
當胎兒分娩的那天
So when the fetus reaches the day of labor,

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,880
潛在的連環殺手就誕生了
The potential serial killer is born.

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,600
媽媽

3 nights ago the cops found his family buried over there.

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,569
埋葬?
Buried?

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,389
鄰居聽到狗吠 過來看

47
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,819
看到它正扒拉著墓

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,819
父親知道了嗎?
What does the father know?

50
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,870
知道一點 他當時正外出巡邏
some of it. he was on patrol.

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,199
他的部隊用了幾天時間才找到他
Took his unit a couple of days to reach him.

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,219
他今天抵達
He arrives today.

53
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,889
去年Williams家族也是以同樣的方式 被殺和被發現
Last year the Williams family Was killed and found exactly the same way.

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,339
他們住在Newport News

55
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,839
父親Dan Williams當時正在海外服役
The father, dan Williams, was also serving overseas.

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,229
警局快扛不住了 受到來自軍方的巨大壓力
Now, the police are overwhelmed And getting serious heat from the military.

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,659
我們需要盡快得出答案
We need some answers fast.

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,679
媒體也是
as do the media.

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,070
他們已經把案件歸為連環殺手所為
They're already calling this the work of a serial killer.

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,009
他們沒說錯 的確是這樣
They're right. it is.

61
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,109
為什麼要埋葬他們呢?
But why bury them?

62
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,739
不可能是為了隱藏屍體啊
I mean, it can't be to hide the bodies.

63
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,470
是懊悔的表現
it's a sign of remorse.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,150
當他們不再感到懊悔 就會再次開始殺戮

沒有掙扎的痕跡

70
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,320
疑犯把槍抵在她孩子的頭上

71
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,160
她還能怎麼做?

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,480
足印是Paul的
Footprints belong to paul.

73

他當時脫身了

74
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,500
媽媽首先被殺 然後是最小的孩子

75
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,809
他藏在主人房
He hides in the master bedroom,

76
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,740
疑犯找到他 一槍斃命
The unsub finds him and shoots him.

77
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,530
然後把他抱到後院

78
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,160
但母親不是這樣 她是被拖出去的
But not the mother. she's dragged out.

79
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,650
疑犯動作迅速熟練
It's quick and proficient.

80
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
只是相對於母親和男孩而言
For the mother and the boys, maybe.

81
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,970
但Lucy是淹死的 而不是被槍殺
But lucy's drowned and not shot.

82
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,750
為什麼要改變作案手法?

F-22猛禽戰鬥機

第一個遇害家庭的父親Dan Williams
The father of the first family killed--dan Williams,

87
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,719
他在哪?
Where is he now?

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,699
他又被派到伊拉克去了
He put in for another tour of iraq.

兩個月前被簡單爆炸裝置殺死
An i.e.d. killed him 2 months ago.

90
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,379
兇手知道父親在海外服役
Whoever did this Knew both fathers were serving overseas.

91
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,019
Laura Downey的結婚戒指不見了
Laura downey's wedding rings are missing.

92
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,229
還有其他東西遺失嗎?
Any other valuables?

93
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,609
我們得問她丈夫才知道
We'll have to ask the husband.

94
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,189
在Williams的案件 只有珠寶和手錶失蹤
From the Williams home, Only jewelry and watches were missing.

95
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,269
疑犯只帶走輕便的東西 意味著他是步行的
The unsub only took what he can carry, Which means he's most likely on foot.

96
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,089
廚房的牆壁上有張照片
There was a photo on the wall in the kitchen.

97
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,229
我想去看看
I'd like to see it.

98
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,970
沒問題
Sure.

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,719
在Williams的案件 沒有性侵犯的跡象
There's no sign of sexual assault In the Williams case.

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,619
Lucy呢?
what about lucy?

101
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,379
根據法醫的報告 也沒有
Nothing on the coroner's report.

102
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,870
也許是有幾個疑犯?
Multiple suspects?

103
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,729
母親被拖出房子
The mother was dragged out of the house.

104
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,999
如果是多人作案
If it had been multiple suspects,

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,159
就能抬起她
They probably would have carried her.

106
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,189
他知道父親不在
He knew the father was absent,

107
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,679
所以最大的威脅不在
Therefore the dominant threat was absent.

108
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,289
我們要找的可能是獨自作案
So we could be looking for a single suspect.

109
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,669
沒有強行進入的跡象
No sign of forced entry.

110
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,979
沒有必要 Lucy在泳池
No need. lucy was in the pool,

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,919
後門開著 疑犯直接進來就是了
Back door was open. the unsub walked right in.

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,449
意味著Lucy是最後死的
That means lucy probably died last.

113
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,099
不管是哪種情況 這女孩始終是窒息而死 而不是被槍殺
In both cases the girls were suffocated And not shot.

114
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,609
我認為這不是巧合
i don't think it's a coincidence.

115
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,619
Garcia 說吧
Hey, garcia. you're on speaker.

In the second envelope was a note saying, "look at what i've done,"

121
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,809
兩封信署名"仰慕者"
and both pieces of mail Have been signed by "an admirer."

122
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,089
是哪個犯人?
Who's the inmate?

123
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,330
這就是問題...
That's the part that...

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,589
滅門 父親外出 結婚戒指
Family annihilator, absent father, wedding rings.

128
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,469
太相似
It's similar.

129
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,230
像什麼?
To what?

130
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,589
4年前 Karl Arnold 外號"狡狐" 屠殺了8個家庭
4 years ago, Karl arnold, aka the fox, Killed 8 families.

131
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,149
就像這案件一樣 他拿走結婚戒指
Just like this case, he took wedding rings,

132
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,785
只不過他是當作戰利品拿走
Only he took them as trophies.

133
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,810
他躲在那些家庭外的灌木叢
he'd hide in the bushes outside the homes.

134
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,790
我觀察他們很多天
And i watched them... for a number of days.

135
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,310
通常是在夜晚
Always at night.

136
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,840
看著他們怎麼生活
Saw how they lived...

137
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,170
有多麼相愛
How they loved.

138
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,590
在下一個夜晚 我就把他們分開
I would keep them apart until the last night.

139
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,370
我把他們逐一帶到地庫
Then i would bring them, one by one, Down to the basement,

140
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,020
年紀最小的最先
The youngest first.

141
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,029
父親是壓軸
The father last.

142
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,380
為什麼 Karl
Why, Karl?

143
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,380
好讓他看看發生了什麼
So he could see what happens...

144
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,670
看看家庭支柱不夠強壯 家人會變得如何悲慘
To families When the head of household isn't strong.

145
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,290
妻子們死去
Wives wither...

146
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,049
孩子夭折
Children perish.

147
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,479
我們要面對的是模仿作案?
So, we're working with a copycat here?

148
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,219
現在還言之過早
It's too early to assume anything.

149
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,739
會影響側寫的準確性
It could bias the profile.

150
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,829
更別提警察 媒體 甚至軍方的反應
Not to mention the police, the media, and the military Would jump all over it.

151
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,039
在我們確定前 這信息只有我們7個人知道就好
Until we're positive, none of this information leaves the 7 of us.

152
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,539
Hotch 是你在Arnold的審判上作證
Hotch, you gave evidence at arnold's trial.

153
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,699
你應該去見見他
I think you should go see him.

154
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:37,129
- 我想帶上Prentiss - 走吧
I'd like to take prentiss with me. Let's go.

155
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,589
讓Garcia檢查Arnold監獄過去四年內
Have garcia check on all of arnold's prison correspondence

156
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,229
所有信件及探訪者
And visitors for the last 4 years.

157
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,320
好的 Joseph Downey上校剛到站
Ok. captain joseph downey has arrived back at the station.

158
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,540
維吉尼亞州警察局
virginia state police

159
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,599
Downey上校 請坐
captain downey, please, sit.

160
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,732
謝了 我沒事
Thank you, i'm fine.

161
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,470
告訴我吧
Tell me everything.

162
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,110
三天前 晚上9:30左右
At around 9:30 3 nights ago,

163
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,900
你的鄰居報案...
Your neighbors called police when...

164
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,770
長官
Sir.

166
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,760
我們相信這是連環殺手干的
We believe it was the work of a serial killer.

167
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,120
抱歉 我的鄰居 Jack和Penny...
I'm sorry. my neighbors, uh, jack and penny--

168
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,020
Downey上校…
Captain downey...

169
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,510
你的家人被謀殺了
Your family was murdered.

170
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,030
全部都不在了
All of them.

171
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,260
需要我們替你打電話給什麼人嗎？
Is there someone you'd like us to call?

172
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,620
打給...不 不 我...
Uh, call, um--no, no. i, uh...

173
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,160
我想馬上回家
I--i'd like to go home now.

174
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,529
Downey上校 Downey上校 上校...
Captain downey. captain downey. captain d--

175
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,470
沒事
Ok.

176
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,040
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,380
很替你難過
I'm so sorry.

178
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:18,292
維吉尼亞州 Red Onion極限管理重罪犯監獄
red onion super max prison virginia 

179
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,509
為什麼等了一年才給Karl寄信
So why wait a year to send Karl a note,

180
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,399
除非他們一直有聯繫
Unless they were communicating the whole time?

181
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,050
這是第一件需要查明的事
That's the first thing we need to find out.

182
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,149
但Karl很自負
But Karl has a big ego.

183
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,910
要他回答問題就得先滿足他的疑問
He's gonna want to answer a question with a question.

184
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,889
他想知道的第一件事會是 我為什麼沒戴著婚戒
The first thing he's gonna want to know Is why i'm not wearing my wedding ring.

185
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,889
然後就會把注意力轉到你身上
And then he will turn his attention to you.

186
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,650
所以你要帶上我
So that's why you brought me along.

187
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,560
你的存在會令他放下戒心
Your presence will throw him off guard.

188
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,069
然後他會向你生動地描述
Then he's gonna want to describe to you in graphic detail

189
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,629
他對那些家庭犯下的每一個性行為
Every sexual act he committed with the families.

190
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,315
為了嚇倒我?
To freak me out?

191
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,229
把你拖進他的幻想世界
To pull you into his fantasy.

192
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,980
控制室 打開16號門
Control, open on 16.

193
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,704
走吧
go ahead

194
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,420
看著前面
Keep your eyes forward.

195
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,950
他最想看的 肯定是孩子們的照片
More than anything, he's going to want to see the images of the children.

196
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,549
我們不能給他
We can't give him that.

197
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:05,830
我們得給他一點甜頭 不然就沒法從他身上得到什麼
We have to give him something or we'll get nothing from him.

198
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,390
來啊
Come on!

199
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,609
那不是...
Isn't that, uh--

200
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,809
加勒特疼痛 沒關係 那是鋼化玻璃 （腰肌和骨骼疼痛的一種）
Garrett pain. that's reinforced glass.

201
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,389
說得輕巧 他可是肢解了14個女人
Easy for you to say. he tore apart 14 women.

202
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,770
把15號牢房門打開
open on 15.

203
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,390
喔 寶貝
whoa, baby!

204
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,160
你好 Karl
Hello, Karl.

205
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,990
探員Hotchner
Agent hotchner.

206
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,920
我怎麼沒聽說你還會帶一個這麼...
I wasn't informed you were bring in a, uh...

207
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,710
他們只說會來兩個探員
They just said two agents.

208
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,490
- 這位是探員... - Emily
This is agent-- Emily...

209
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,860
Prentiss
Prentiss.

210
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,240
我知道你的一切
I know all about you.

211
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,739
如果不明嫌犯模仿"狡狐"作案
If this unsub's copying the fox,

212
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,669
咱們就要從這個角度對他進行側寫
Then we profile him like the fox.

213
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,320
Karl Arnold當時是在做心理幫助咨詢對吧
?????system,right

214
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,879
沒錯 這也就給他間接監視 確定 瞭解 受害者提供了非常便利的條件
Yeah. which made it easy for him to watch, target, And learn about the victims from a distance.

215
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,579
而且這個身份也不會引人懷疑
Yeah, it also made him hard to find.

216
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,049
和"狡狐"一樣 這回的嫌犯也是 找到了很好的掩飾
Like the fox, our man here found a way To hide in plain sight.

217
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,199
但是他所涉及的家庭職業構成完全不同
But he's pulling from 2 completely different units.

218
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,219
Williams是個醫生 Downey是個軍官
Williams a medic, downey an army captain.

219
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,579
有人知道他們和軍隊的關係
Someone knew of that military connection.

220
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,389
這兩次都是在父親被調走之後的一個月發生的
Both families were attacked within a month of the fathers being deployed.

221
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,739
給予他們充足的時間先適應 父親不在身邊的新生活
Gave them time to settle in, Get comfortable that the fathers weren't there.

222
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,279
等到"狡狐"闖進房子堶 就開始和他們一起居住
And once inside the home, the fox would live with the families

223
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,099
進而開始扮演父親的角色
And then become the father.

224
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,849
可這個不明嫌犯並非如此
But not this unsub.

225
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,800
他只是進去把家人分開再殺害
He just walked in and dispensed with the family.

226
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,249
同一屋檐下生活的場景根本 不曾出現在他的腦海當中
Living with them wasn't part of the fantasy.

227
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,349
探員Rossi
agent rossi.

228
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,840
這是你要的圖片
The picture you requested.

229
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,904
都靠你我們才從這張合影上取下了很多指紋
Thanks to you, we pulled some prints off it.

230
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:43,263
所有的指紋都在Lucy身上
And all the prints were on lucy.

231
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,010
子彈卻直接射向父親
The bullet hit the father dead center.

232
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,629
指紋和Newport News兇殺案相吻合
The prints match that of the Newport News killings.

233
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,799
是同一人所為
It's the same killer.

234
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,649
像"狡狐"那樣的反家庭分子 一般都喜歡先從一個身上下手
Family annihilators like the fox, they start with one victim.

235
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,989
等到他們滿意了
And once they feel capable,

236
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,599
再對下一個下手
They move on to a second victim.

237
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,539
一般不會同一時間全部殺死
They don't start with entire families.

238
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,660
也就是說還有許多受害者 只是我們還沒找到
There are more victims. we just haven't found them yet.

239
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,960
Karl 看來你有了個粉絲
Karl, it appears you have a fan.

240
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,350
崇拜者
Admirer.

241
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,530
不是粉絲
Not a fan.

242
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,990
很大區別呢 對吧
Big difference. right?

243
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,140
這是你頭一次和你的崇拜者聯繫嗎?
Is this the first time you've been contacted by your admirer?

244
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,000
我有好多粉絲呢
I have many fans.

245
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,030
還有個人主頁
Even my own website.

246
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,590
你有嗎你
Don't you?

247
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,530
他們問的問題肯定會讓你們大吃一驚
You'd be astounded At some of the questions they ask.

248
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,639
我還把這些整理了一個日誌呢 想不想讀一讀啊
I make a log of all of them. Would you like to read some?

249
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,890
我非常樂意
I would love to.

250
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,320
真的?
You'd love to?

251
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,050
好吧
Yes.

252
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,510
這
Here.

253
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,270
拿去看吧
Look.

254
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,310
我一會再看
Maybe later.

255
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,690
你的崇拜者像你一樣 專取別人的婚戒
Your admirer is taking wedding rings, Just like you.

256
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,949
不過可能原因不相同
But maybe not for the same reason.

257
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,730
是啊 就像是你也拿走了我收藏的所有婚戒
Like how you took all of mine.

258
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,020
不過你雖然拿走了我的
You took mine.

259
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,150
但我也看到 你丟了你的
But i see... you lost yours.

260
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,129
8枚戒指 4個家庭
8 rings, 4 families.

261
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,309
還是說你一家只取了一枚
Or was it one ring for each family?

262
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,820
你的婚戒怎麼沒的呢
How'd you come to lose your ring?

263
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,279
哦 別跟我說是受了什麼工傷
wait, don't tell me. A casualty of the job.

264
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,709
我的工作就是把你送進這堥
My job is what put you in here.

265
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,750
的確
True.

266
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,840
不過 家庭破裂倒霉的是孩子 我說的對吧?
But then, it's the children Who suffer most. wouldn't you agree?

267
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,100
這點你應該比我更清楚
You'd know more about that than me.

268
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,630
所以你得來向我討教
Which is why you came to me.

269
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,339
這個忙我還是幫得上的 探員Hotchner
I can help you with that, agent hotchner.

270
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,950
絕對能幫
I certainly can.

271
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,590
不過我要看那些照片
But i'll need to see those photos.

272
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,430
可以嗎
May i?

273
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,900
借一步說話
A word?

274
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,229
Emily 有什麼問題嗎
Is there a problem, emily?

275
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,760
沒問題 Karl
There's no problem, Karl.

276
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,030
我們不能給他看這些
We cannot show him these.

277
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,429
這些圖片可能就是他的動機起源 也是我們查案的切入點
These images will be his undoing And our way in.

278
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,399
但是他們不是普通的照片
But they're not just images.

279
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,589
這些只是照片
That's exactly what they are.

280
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,039
我們不能這樣利用Lucy
We can't use lucy like that.

281
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,790
想要有所得 就得有所捨棄
It's a tradeoff we have to make.

282
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,653
難道我們真的要用一個12歲女孩 穿著泳衣的屍體照片當做誘餌
So, we are using a dead 12-year-old girl in a bathing suit As a bargaining chip? 

283
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,245
為了什麼?
for what?

284
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,069
但是對他來說這圖片也非同小可
To him it's not just a photograph.

285
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,220
它的意義非凡 而我們太需要這些信息了
It's much, much more, and we need to know what.

286
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,230
你聽我說 我...
Look, i'm...

287
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,480
我之前從來沒幹過這些
I've never done this before.

288
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,830
現在你也不必勉強
And you don't have to now.

289
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,950
不 我必須要做
Yes, i do.

290
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,550
那好 一旦我發覺他要說什麼了 我就先離開
All right. when i feel he's ready to talk, I'll leave the room.

291
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,440
你來讓他開口
You get him talking.

292
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,560
不論他做什麼 不論你怎麼想 都一定要堅持住
Whatever he does, whatever you feel, Just stay on script.

293
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,170
我們要知道他為什麼殺了那些家庭
We need to know why he killed those families.

294
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,629
他有幾個來訪者
he's had a smattering of visits,

295
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,589
還有一些工作分配聯絡
A couple of whack jobs contact him,

296
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,549
不過這些都與崇拜者無關
But nothing as direct as this admirer person.

297
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,820
那照片上面的指紋呢
how are we doing on the prints on the picture?

298
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,920
哦 我還在查
Oh. i'm still running them.

299
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,499
你那邊怎麼樣
How are you holding up?

300
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,539
軍旅家庭 一般都惶恐度日
Military families, they always fear the worst.

301
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,139
恐怕哪一天父親就回不來了
They know their men may not return,

302
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,349
但是 這一次卻是父親失去了整個家庭
But this-- To see a father lose so much.

303
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,059
我真希望能做點什麼
I wish i had something for you.

304
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,059
可是我真的找不到任何 能把這些家庭聯繫起來的
I truly cannot find a damn thing That connects these families.

305
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,290
軍人和家屬之間相隔萬里
Geographically, both of them Are thousands of miles away from their family.

306
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,709
能不能找到他們之間的聯絡 電郵 信件或者是電話
Communication's all they had-- Emails, phone calls, letters.

307
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,339
但是這都屬於軍事通信
But that's military communication.

308
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,489
即便家屬的私人通信 也需要授權才能進入
Even between families, it requires a kind of juice i'm not allowed to use.

309
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,069
不會吧 你可是侵入過FBI數據庫的啊
Come on. you hacked into the fbi database.

310
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,289
是啊 我工作就這麼來的嘛
And they gave me a job.

311
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,420
而且我還很喜歡這工作
And i like my job.

312
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,079
我也很珍惜自己的小命
And i like my life.

313
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,479
那好吧 我這邊疏通一下
All right, i'll make some inquiries.

314
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,389
- 先謝謝啦 保重 - 拜
Ok. do that. take care. Bye.

315
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,849
Lucy是最後一個死的 而且一個人
So lucy dies last, alone.

316
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,809
單獨這個說明不了什麼
This by itself doesn't really mean anything,

317
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,499
但是如果我們再仔細看看Williams的檔案
But when we look again at the Williams file,

318
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,309
我們發現入室者留下最多的指紋 也都集中在Karen Williams的房間
We notice that the majority of the foreign fingerprints Came from karen Williams' room,

319
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,149
也就是說嫌犯大多數時間都和Karen在一起
Which means the unsub spent most of his time in there with karen.

320
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,409
所以他必須要把她與其他家庭成員隔離開
Then he must have separated her from the rest of the family.

321
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,529
Lucy Downey那時候已經在泳池堣F
Lucy downey was already in the pool.

322
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,299
已經和家人隔離開就不用嫌犯費神了
That much was done for the unsub.

323
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,273
可是不明嫌犯仍然受到某種強迫癥的驅使
Then this unsub is driven by some other kind of compulsion,

324
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:56,593
一些其他的心理需求
Some other need.

325
00:17:56,593 --> 00:18:00,020
Hotch說的沒錯 這絕不是巧合 可能是潛在的作案特徵
Hotch was right. this isn't a coincidence. It's a possible signature.

326
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,330
長官 我明白 但是有兩家人都死了
Sir, i know that, but two families have died.

327
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,670
我明白這不合乎規定 但是...
No, i realize this breaks protocol, but--

328
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,550
不 我們想要的只是阻止類似慘案再次發生
No, all we want is to stop this from happening again.

329
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,020
長官 我向您保證 探員Garcia絕不會讓您失望
Sir, i promise you, agent garcia is the best we have.

330
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,899
好的 謝謝您
Ok. thank you.

331
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,209
我們需要以每一個受害者為中心
We need to look at each of the victims as a hub,

332
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,749
去研究他們家庭之外的生活
With lives outside of their own families.

333
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,669
所有人都有家庭以外的生活和社交圈
Well, each one of them has their own connections outside the family.

334
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,799
學校 朋友 老師 生意夥伴
School, friends, tutors, business colleagues.

335
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,739
所有這些人都有辦法進入他們家
And each one of these people Are considered access points back to the family.

336
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,059
不過可能需要好幾周
That could take weeks.

337
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,919
至少從懊悔到再起殺意前 我們還有時間
Well, you have time. From remorse to the desire to kill again

338
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,669
這期間有可能嫌犯經歷情緒上的波動
The unsub will go through a gamut of emotions.

339
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,009
也可能在他再次動殺人念頭前 又要過一年
It could be another year before the unsub feels the desire to kill again.

340
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,709
鑒於罪行極為嚴重
As horrific as these crimes are,

341
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,809
這堥S辦法跟他耗上這麼久
This city doesn't have the resources to commit that amount of time.

342
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,759
我們已得到授權 現在能得到 所有關於父親的軍事記錄
We have full access to all military records for the fathers.

343
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,150
所以 至少現在我們能瞭解不同家庭的核心了
Well, now at least We have access to the main hub between families.

344
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,130
父親
The dads.

345
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,960
那好吧 咱們先找出他們有什麼聯繫
All right, well, let's find out What connects them.

346
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,670
站起來
Stand up.

347
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,660
你想看 是不是
You want to see, don't you?

348
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,350
迫不及待
Very much.

349
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,020
我們會給你看
We're gonna show you.

350
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,139
這堿ODowney家的房子
This is the home of the downey family.

351
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,460
這家有3個孩子
There were 3 children.

352
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,999
他們都多大?
How old are the children?

353
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,289
分別12歲 9歲和4歲 一女兩男
12, 9, and 4. a girl and two boys.

354
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,560
他們在哪堻Q發現?
Where were they found?

355
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,490
那邊
Over there.

356
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,070
被埋起來的
Buried.

357
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,400
有趣
Interesting.

358
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,130
孩子母親Laura還有兩個男孩在屋堻Q殺
Laura, the mother, and the two boys were killed In the house.

359
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,780
那女兒呢?
The daughter?

360
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,980
這堿O母親和小兒子被殺的地方
This is where the mother and the youngest son were killed.

361
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,760
另一個男孩在臥室衣櫥堶掖Q射殺
The other boy was shot in the bedroom closet.

362
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,710
- 父親到哪堨h了 - 在國外
Where's the father? overseas.

363
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,320
嫌犯知道這個
The killer knows this.

364
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,550
他對這個家庭非常瞭解
He knows everything about this family,

365
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,490
他仔細觀察他們的每一個舉動 確保自己達到目的
And he watches their every move To be sure he achieves what he needs.

366
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,940
你肯定不知道他是怎麼知道父親不在
You have no idea how he knows The father is gone

367
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,489
怎麼把目光放到這一家的
Or how he targets these families,

368
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,650
這些個怎麼
And the how.

369
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,040
才是解決問題的關鍵
That's the key.

370
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,300
這也是為什麼他想要與我並駕齊驅
The how... Is why he... Was able to catch me.

371
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,720
你暗中觀察了這些家庭很多天
You watched the families for days.

372
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,010
很多周
Weeks.

373
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,240
我要瞭解他們
I got to know them.

374
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,079
但是你們要找的人並不是這樣
But not your guy.

375
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,290
他不需要那麼多周 如果他準備了那麼久 肯定會在屋子埵h呆一會
He doesn't need weeks. if he did, he'd stay longer.

376
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,530
為什麼?
Why?

377
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,610
因為他要好好享受一番
So he can enjoy them.

378
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,009
但我不明白的是
But what i don't understand--

379
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,330
為什麼他不把孩子與大人分開
Is why he didn't separate the children.

380
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,470
正是
Exactly.

381
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,080
因為那麼做會更好地掌控局勢 不會有出錯的餘地
That way you have more control. no room for error.

382
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,142
為什麼他不把那些孩子帶到另外一間屋
Why he didn't put the boys in separate rooms 

383
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:25,329
告訴他們 "如果你們哭的話"
and say, If you cry...

384
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,790
"我就殺了你們媽媽"
I'll have to kill mommy.

385
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,170
告訴我
Tell me...

386
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,340
那個女孩是怎麼死的
How did the girl die?

387
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,920
她是被淹死的
She was drowned.

388
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,450
而其他的是被射殺的
Yet the others were shot.

389
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,130
能讓我看一眼她的照片麼?
May i see her?

390
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,350
這女孩哪點這麼吸引你了?
What's so special about the girl?

391
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,480
兇手之所以要悶死她
To suffocate her.

392
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,760
是為了享受死者嚥下最後一口氣時 帶給自己的快感
To feel the life leave her body Means everything to the man who did this.

393
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,579
對你而言也許是這樣 但不是兇手
To you, maybe, but not to this killer.

394
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,100
你們並不一樣
Not in the same way.

395
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,299
我殺人只是為了讓孩子看看 他們的父親有多無能
All i did was show them how weak fathers could be.

396
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,909
僅此而已
That's all.

397
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,600
你在殺每個孩子之前都猥褻了他們
Every child you killed you abused physically.

398
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,350
但這人卻沒有
For this man, there is no sexual gratification.

399
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,200
不管怎樣 我免去了那些父親們的痛苦
At least i spared the fathers The grief of living.

400
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,230
求你了...求求你了
Please... Please don't do this.

401
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,830
走吧 去洗把澡
Come on. let's get you cleaned up.

402
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,019
Dani! 我沒告訴過你要鎖上門麼?
Dani! didn't i tell you to always lock the door!

403
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,050
Nick 把鞋脫了!
Nick, cleats off!

404
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,010
Dani!你在哪?
Dani! where are you?

405
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,160
Dani?
Dani?

406
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,310
媽媽?
Mom?

407
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,419
求你了 別
Please don't--

408
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,710
求你了...
Please...

409
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,160
媽媽...
Mom...

410
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,654
- 女孩是被悶死的 而不是槍擊 對吧? - 是的
The girl was suffocated, not shot, right? yes.

411
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,210
和上兩起案子一樣
Just like the other two.

412
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,330
她叫Dani 14歲
Her name is Dani. she's 14.

413
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,359
她父親呢?
and the father?

414
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,870
在阿富汗
Afghanistan.

415
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,670
這可以排除是贖罪的表現了吧?
Does this rule out remorse?

416
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,810
我想是的
Yes, it does.

417
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,590
現在怎麼辦?
So what is it now?

418
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,059
作案的升級說明嫌疑犯心理再次受到衝擊
The escalation between kills Indicates a major psychological break.

419
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,099
為什麼說又升級了?
How is it escalated?

420
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,469
作案間隔時間從1年變成了3天
The timeframe between kills Has gone from a year to just 3 days.

421
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,450
嫌犯一定發生了什麼大事
For the unsub, something has dramatically changed.

422
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,139
某些外部原因刺激到了嫌犯
Some kind of major external stressor forced this unsub

423
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,409
讓他需要毫無愧疚地再去殺人
Into feeling the need to kill again without any remorse.

424
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,839
嫌犯的鏡像神經元 加之以往經歷引起的刺激 導致了這起案件
Mirror neurons and stressors Relating to the unsub's past May have triggered this,

425
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,910
這是兩個最主要的因素
The strongest of which is smell.

426
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,200
這個聲音
That sound.

427
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,150
Williams一家在一年前被害
The Williams were killed a year ago.

428
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,840
那時蘭利有沒有什麼大型軍演?
Were there any military maneuvers going on at langley at that time?

429
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,880
每年一度的空軍展 但規模不如今年
The annual air show, but nothing as big as this.

430
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,180
他又行動了 是不是?
he's killed again, hasn't he?

431
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,410
我真幸運啊
Luckily for me.

432
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,830
幸運?
Luckily?

433
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,410
現在就剩我們兩人
Now we're alone.

434
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,000
你說被害人不認識兇手 為什麼?
You stated that the families don't know the killer. why?

435
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,120
現在我們在等待 是不是? 我們倆...
Now we wait, right? you and i,

436
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,410
在等我的仰慕者會不會聯繫我
See if my...admirer contacts me.

437
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,070
他會的
He will.

438
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,671
- 我學的第一個案子就是你的 - 真的?
Yours was one of the first cases i studied. Really?

439
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,140
從此我就迷上了
I've been fascinated ever since.

440
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,320
迷上什麼?
With what?

441
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,240
你
You.

442
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,590
而現在...
And now...

443
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,420
你想知道...我對孩子幹了些什麼
You want to know what i did... To the children.

444
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,570
是不是?
Don't you?

445
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,690
是的
Yes.

446
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,490
我可以演示給你看
I can show you.

447
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,530
我可以完完全全的演示給你看
I can show you exactly what i did to them.

448
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,840
說吧
Tell me.

449
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,380
孩子是如此珍貴
Children are so precious.

450
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,600
如此純潔
So clean.

451
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,489
但同樣需要引導
But they need guidance.

452
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,370
特別是女孩
Especially the girls.

453
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,090
為什麼?
Why?

454
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,790
女孩比男孩更輸得起
Girls have much more to lose... Than boys.

455
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,370
事實也是如此 女性更能忍受痛苦
It's a fact the female body can handle pain much better.

456
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,480
你對他們做了什麼?
What did you do to them?

457
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,940
我向他們演示 男人...
I showed them What men...

458
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,250
他們的父親和哥哥...
Their fathers and brothers...

459
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,190
有什麼本領
Are capable of.

460
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,439
什麼本領?
And what is that?

461
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:46,220
你確定你想要知道?
You sure you want to know?

462
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,690
是的
Yes.

463
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,029
Morgan 要是刺激兇手的是空演的話
Morgan, if the langley air show is the stressor,

464
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,839
那Karl的仰慕者不符合簡報
Then Karl's admirer doesn't fit the profile.

465
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,699
一個神經病不會炫耀自己是神經病的 Hotch
A psychopath suffering a major psychological break Doesn't brag about it, hotch.

466
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,369
無論你怎麼做 也不可能救得了今天那家人
There was nothing you could have done That would have saved that family today.

467
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,879
要是我做對了側寫就可以
Well, that's if i'm right about the profile.

468
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,360
我希望如此
I think you are.

469
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,829
Karl的仰慕者和案件無關
Karl's admirer doesn't have anything to do with these killings.

470
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,810
無論怎樣 我們都要知道這個仰慕者是誰
Well, either way, we need to know who is.

471
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,829
Hotch 我要你繼續待在那並找出這個人
Hotch, i want you to stay with him and find out

472
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,679
從而制止那畜生
So we can stop this son of a bitch.

473
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,120
知道了
I plan to.

474
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,269
每當我殺了孩子
Once i killed the children,

475
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,290
總讓我感嘆
It always amazed me

476
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,270
他們的父親對於一些不可避免的事情 是多麼蒼白無力
How little... The father fought the inevitable.

477
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,290
什麼事情?
Which was what?

478
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,750
死亡
Dying.

479
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,519
我在搜索william一家的郵件
I'm trolling through the Williams' emails,

480
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,170
衛星電話 家庭電話
Satellite phone calls, land line phone calls,

481
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,289
家庭照片 他們的生活 和其他相關的東西
Family photos, their life, all of it.

482
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,359
Downey一家呢?
What about the downeys?

483
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,539
下一個就是他們 有太多資料了
They're up next, and there's a ton to go through.

484
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,759
- 指紋方面呢 garcia? - 沒有發現
Fingerprints, garcia? zip.

485
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,439
沒有匹配的
They're--they-- there's nothing here.

486
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,549
抱歉 同事們
I'm sorry, folks.

487
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,289
Garcia 擴大搜索範圍
Garcia, widen the search.

488
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,679
Morgan 我已經試過了 暴力犯罪程序堶 包括了國家的所有數據庫
Morgan, i already did. vicap combines every database In this country.

489
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,689
這已經是能做的極限了
we're as wide as we can go.

490
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,559
虐待會給孩子帶來長期陰影
Abuse can have a long-term effect on any child's brain,

491
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,219
但對於那些具有高危基因
But for the abused child who has the high-risk gene

492
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,359
以及眶額腦皮層受過創傷的孩子來說
And the orbital cortex damage,

493
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,219
將帶來不可估量的影響
The combination is devastating.

494
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,929
好了 這次空演是軍方的
All right, this air show is military.

495
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,519
而受害者家的父親都在國外服役
These fathers are all soldiers fighting a war on foreign soil.

496
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,759
我們也知道了這些墳墓並不是贖罪的表現
We know that none of these graves are a sign of remorse.

497
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,419
大家看一下這些墳墓
Hey, guys. look at these graves.

498
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,539
它們看起來像什麼
What are they reminiscent of?

499
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,809
萬人坑
Mass graves.

500
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,779
正是  說明嫌疑犯在他童年的時候
Exactly. which would indicate The unsub experienced early pubescent

501
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,049
曾經目睹了類似的墳墓
3-dimentional mirror neurons

502
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,029
而他的鏡像神經元便反饋給大腦 從而做出類似舉動
Reflecting events similar to the one they're creating.

503
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,199
所以我認為嫌疑犯在戰亂中長大
I think this unsub was born into conflict.

504
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,160
但在哪出生時會伴隨著戰亂呢?
But where was he born into conflict?

505
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,079
大家什麼時候在美國看到過萬人坑?
When was the last time we saw anything like mass graves in the u.s.?

506
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,409
我們這一代沒有目睹過
We haven't. not in our lifetimes.

507
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,739
不是在我們的國土上
Not within our borders.

508
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,499
暴力罪犯程序是全國性的而不是全球性的
Vicap is national, not international.

509
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,529
Garcia 國際數據庫有什麼發現?
Garcia, international databases?

510
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,639
國際刑事警察組織的數據庫是最完善的 要是嫌疑犯有前科 就會有記錄
Interpol is the biggest. if they did it, they're in it.

511
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,409
很明顯他以前犯過案
It's pretty obvious that he's done this before,

512
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,090
問題關鍵是地點和原因
But the question is where and why.

513
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,750
Karl 我從未想過你會如此坦白
Karl, i never thought that you'd be this honest.

514
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,610
每一個誠實男人背後總有一個誘人的女人
It takes a good woman To make an honest man.

515
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,619
不管怎麼說 說白了吧
And anyway, let's face it--

516
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,809
她比你更有吸引力
She's prettier than you.

517
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,459
Karl 你知道你殺害這些人的真正原因麼?
Karl, do you know why you killed all those families?

518
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,230
我已經告訴你了
I've already told you why.

519
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,370
不 你只告訴我用什麼手段 而不是原因
No, you told me how, not why.

520
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,269
而這個案子堨手作案的原因
and the reasons why, in this case,

521
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,369
和你很不一樣
Are very different than they were for you.

522
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,350
完完全全不一樣
they're very, very different.

523
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,659
正如你形象地告訴Prentiss探員的一樣
And as you so eloquently have been pointing out to agent prentiss,

524
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,120
你的動機只是性
All of your motivations were about sex.

525
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,230
你從你父親那學來的動機
Motivations you learned from your father.

526
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,589
你還真在我身上下了功夫
You really have Done your research on me,

527
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,660
Emily
Emily.

528
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,960
我榮幸之至
I'm flattered.

529
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,699
你同樣有著極端的自我仇恨情緒
You're also filled with feelings Of extreme self-hatred.

530
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,210
和這麼個尤物工作一定會分心吧
It must be distracting Working with someone so beautiful.

531
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,120
你強迫他們看著自己的孩子死去
You forced those men to watch their children die,

532
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,119
這就是原因 Karl
And here's why, Karl.

533
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,389
這就是你變成這樣的原因
Here's why you are what you are.

534
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,210
我該怎樣取悅你呢
What i would do to you.

535
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,829
把他們的父親放在最後一個殺害
By killing the fathers last,

536
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,149
你覺得就像在殺害自己的父親一樣
You were killing your own father,

537
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,220
最後輪到你自己
And ultimately yourself,

538
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,030
不斷重複
Over and over again.

539
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,670
這還沒有結束 Hotchner探員 至少對你來說
This isn't over, agent hotchner. At least not for you.

540
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,070
等等 Hotch
Wait, hotch.

541
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,970
Karl的案子堿O父親
For Karl, it's all about the fathers.

542
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,750
這個案子堿O女孩
In this case, it's all about the girls.

543
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,049
他們都是最後死的
They die last.

544
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,839
他們是最後被解決的 都沒受到槍擊
They're laid out last. none of them are shot.

545
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,359
都沒有受到性侵犯
None of them show any signs of sexual motive.

546
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,569
要是這個案子也按照這邏輯?
What if we applied that logic to these killings?

547
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,209
我們沒想到過的線索
That's something we hadn't considered.

548
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,839
怎麼想得到?太少見了
Why would we? it's so rare.

549
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,569
你們在說什麼?
What is?

550
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,629
殺手是女性
The killer's a woman.

551
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,180
- 女性? - 我這就告訴morgan
A woman? i'll let morgan know.

552
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:56,079
Karl 剛剛你說這件事還沒結束
Karl, just now you said That this wasn't over for me.

553
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,780
你什麼意思?
What did you mean by that?

554
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,570
他只是剛開始熱身
He's just getting warmed up.

555
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,490
只是...
It's just...

556
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,230
你沒看到本質
You don't see it.

557
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,010
但你會的
But you will.

558
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,020
好的 我們現在就辦
All right, we'll work it in right now.

559
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,369
Prentiss認為嫌疑犯可能是女性
Prentiss thinks the unsub might be a woman.

560
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,729
這就是我們找不到性侵犯痕跡的原因
That's why we couldn't find a sexual motive.

561
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,789
不管她是哪的人她父親一定是軍人
Wherever she's from, her father's a military man.

562
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,799
Derek 我從國際刑警組織那找到了線索
Derek, i've got a hit. interpol.

563
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,629

2 hits. 3 hits. 3 crime scenes. 3 different cities.

564

然後過了兩年

567
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,889
足跡出現在意大利的摩德納
The same prints show up in modena, italy,

568

Then 2007, london, england, young couple, both shot.

569
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,019
你們說對了 她有前科
You were right. she's killed before.

570
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,059
薩格勒布是克羅地亞首都
Zagreb is the capital city of croatia.

571
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,159
有什麼大事?
Is that significant?

572
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,869
在91年95年 他們為爭取民族獨立而發動戰爭 (即波黑戰爭,波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那)
Between 1991 and '95 they fought A bitter battle for independence.

573
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,059
塞爾維亞人曾試圖種族清洗 超過4萬人的波斯尼亞籍穆斯林
Serbian forces tried to ethnically cleanse Over 40,000 bosnian muslims.

574
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,789
接著兩年前 由於某種原因她來到美國
Then at some point within the last 2 years, she moved to america.

575
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,109
- 她不停奔波 - 奔波至一個住滿了軍人家庭的城市
She's on the run. and ran right into a city Filled with military families.

576
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,919
在嫌疑犯心理埋下陰影的萬人坑
The only mass graves reminiscent of the ones the unsubs created

577
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,119
在戰後的波斯尼亞到處都是
Were found all over bosnia after the war,

578
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,339
但都比不上在斯雷佈雷尼察發現的 (波黑一個遭塞族軍隊血洗的城市)
But none of them rival that of srebrenica.

579
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,979
荷蘭的聯合國維和部隊在那建立了難民營
dutch u.n. forces created a safe haven for refugees.

580
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,069
然後在95年 波黑軍隊包圍了斯雷佈雷尼察
then in 1995, bosnian serb forces surrounded the town.

581
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,189
一個精神病患者在這種戰亂下長大
a psychopath born in the middle of that conflict--

582
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,649
太不幸了
That's not a good mix.

583
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,219
她將自己的痛苦經歷強加在受害者身上
she's exacting her life experiences onto the victims.

584
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,779
你認為這個女人當時在場?
You think this woman was there?

585
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,979
想想看吧 蘭利和斯雷佈雷尼察一樣 佈滿了平民和軍用車輛
Well, think about it. langley's filling up with civilians And military vehicles just like srebrenica.

586
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,509
你能判斷出她的年齡嗎?
Can you determine her age?

587
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,519
根據受害者學
Based on victimology,

588
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,159
這些被害女孩的年齡都低於15歲
Each of these girls is no older than 15.

589
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,779
而巴爾幹戰爭從93年持續到95年
The balkan war lasted between '93 and '95,

590
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,419
如果這些女孩代表疑犯
So if the girls represent the unsub,

591
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,969
那麼她應該接近30歲
She's somewhere in her late 20s.

592
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,389
斯雷佈雷尼察最後怎樣了?
how did srebrenica end?

593
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,890
發生了大屠殺
it was a massacre.

594
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,574
(一連串波斯尼亞語 = = )
...

595
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,110
我認為這女人和Karl沒有關聯
i don't think this woman has anything to do with Karl.

596
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,800
我鼓勵他
I encouraged him.

597
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,390
我向他調情
I flirted with him.

598
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,740
把事情弄得很私人
Made it personal.

599
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,510
親近殺手...
Getting intimate with a killer is...

600
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,960
真的很難
So different.

601
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,380
這就是我們的工作
It's what we do.

602
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,850
沒錯 但是...
Yeah. but...

603
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,990
現在我怎麼想都沒用了 是嗎
There's no fixing how i feel right now, is there?

604
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,040
對
No.

605
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,700
但有助解決案件
But it helped the case.

606
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
你只是盡自己的職責
And you did what you had to.

607
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,490
Hotchner探員
Agent hotchner.

608
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,889

00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,280
我還有一件事想和你分享
There's one final thing i'd like to share with you.

This unsub is armed and suffering A major psychological break,

612
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,259
她會毫不猶豫地再開殺戒
And she will not hesitate to kill again.

613
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,139
她是白人 年齡接近30
She's white and in her 20s.

614
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,339

We believe she came to the u.s. a few years ago.

615
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,809
她是步行行動的
She's likely on foot.

616
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,049
可能是東歐人
She could be eastern european.

617
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,889
也許只懂一點英語或完全不會
She may speak little to no english.

618
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,469
要是你們設法逮捕或堵截這個女人
Now, if you manage to apprehend or corner her,

619
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,999
別低估她

621
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,079
Downey家和Forester家相隔不到一英里
The downeys live less than a mile from the foresters,

622
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,960
意味著她就在這區域內的某處
Which means she's somewhere in this area.

623
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,130
好像看到了什麼

等等 會是這個嗎?

他們都和同一個網站有關
They're all connected to the same site.

已經將現在公眾所面臨的危險知會過媒體
Every media outlet is being informed Of the clear and present danger to the public.

All these family photos were printed by photobug.

637
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,489
難道資料不是受保護的嗎?

638
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,799
對於網站運營商可不是
Not from the people who run it.

639
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,239
這是軍方家屬溝通的好途徑
It's a great way for military families to keep in touch.

And a perfect way to target a family Without anybody's knowledge.

642
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,779
所以我拿著你的側寫

入侵他們的僱員數據庫
