1
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,580
這是Dorris Archer 愛達荷州博伊西 今年失蹤的第三個女人
This is dorris archer,she's the third woman to go missing in boise,idaho,this year,

2
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,810
之前是Paula Renmar和Samantha Rush
along with paula renmar and samantha rush.

3
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,560
他們的失蹤間隔約為2個月
They went missing roughly 2 months apart.

4
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,410
你好
Well,hello.

5
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,440
怎麼 你加入男孩樂隊了?
What,did you join a boy band?

6
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,910
沒
No.

7
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,120
好的 我們要關注什麼群體? 30歲上下的女性
Ok,so what are we looking at here? Late 20s,early 30s.

8
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,100
都還未婚 但有兩人戀愛中
All single,though two are in committed relationships.

9
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,580
都獨立生活
All living on their own.

10
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,340
都是很普通的郊區住房 不明嫌犯得以避人耳目
Looks like normal suburban houses. Gives the unsub privacy.

11
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,220
受害者的差異比相似點更引人注目
The differences are more striking than the similarities.

12
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,240
髮色不同 體形不同
Different hair colors, different body shapes.

13
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,410
他的作案手法我們瞭解嗎?
What do you know about his M.O.?

14
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,870
這也是我們被邀的原因
That's why we were invited in.

15
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,570
綁架現場非常乾淨
The abduction sites are pristine.

16
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,280
沒有除受害者之外的他人DNA
And there's no dna besides the victims',

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,260
而且也沒強行侵入和爭鬥的痕跡
and there's no sign of forced entry or a struggle.

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,930
直至被綁2到3天後 才有人報告她們失蹤
And the victims aren't reported missing until 2 or 3 days after they're abducted.

19
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,760
2 3天啊...
2 or 3 days...

20
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,090
這樣的女人突然杳無音信 一定會有人注意
Women like this don't just vanish without somebody noticing.

21
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,180
是的 因此我讓Garcia去挖掘她們的生活
Yes. Which is why I asked garcia to dig into their lives.

22
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,330
我大略看了看她們的網上活動
And when I took a look at their online activity,

23
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,110
馬上看出了不明嫌犯的犯案行徑
I could easily see how the unsub is doing it.

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,920
- 在線社交網站 - 對 比如Facebook Twitter
- Social networking sites. - Yeah. Facebook,twitter.

25
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,220
隨便說一個浪費時間的在線社交網站 受害者一定是註冊用戶
You name an online life-sharing time suck, the victims were on it.

26
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,160
看一眼她們最後發表的信息 說的東西幾乎一樣
And if you look at each of their last posts, they say kind of the same thing...

27
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,870
出城散心 出差 或者度假
Going out of town, going on a business trip, going on a vacation.

28
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,870
但如果看下三者的發表時間和日期
But when you look at the time and date stamp of each of these,

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,510
來點"陰陽魔界"的配樂吧
cue the "twilight zone" music,

30
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,180
因為 三條都是在受害者 失蹤之後的早晨發佈的
because they were all posted the morning after each of them went missing.

31
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,320
是不明嫌犯發佈的
The unsub posted them.

32
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,270
在線社交網絡 為嫌犯獵取目標提供了便利
Social networks are an easy way for an unsub to target his victims.

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,610
這些受害的女人的生活非常透明
These women were especially open.

34
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,640
她們發佈全部的生活細節 包括晚餐吃什麼 去哪堿鸕|等
They posted everything from what they were having for dinner to where they were going on dates.

35
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,790
不明嫌犯把受害者加為好友 以此為幌子來控制受害者
So this unsub friends his victims and then uses that as a cover once he takes them.

36
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,860
這表明他可以"黑"進她們的賬戶 所以他電腦水平出色
That means he can hack into their accounts. So he's excellent with computers.

37
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,610
可以肯定他很有耐心 很有組織性
Definitely profiles as patient and organized.

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,070
他不遺餘力地 抹掉現場所有的犯罪證據
He's obsessive enough to remove all forensic details,

39
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,820
而且為了誘拐目標不惜耐心等待2個月
but also patient enough to wait 2 months before abductions.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
他真是百忍成金 有3天時間可以對這些女人隨意為所欲為
He can afford to be. He gets 3 days to do whatever he wants to these women.

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,980
我們得做好準備 這些女人可能已經死了
That means we need to assume these women are already dead.

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,520
現在的問題是 他對她們都做了什麼?
The question is what he does while he has them.

43
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:54,450
<font color=#FF7F00>犯罪心理 第五季 第22集 網絡永恆</font>
<font color=#70DBDB>Criminal Minds Season05 Episode22 The Internet Is Forever</font>

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,550
"溝通 其最顯著的問題在於 我們總幻想它確實發生過"
"the single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place."

45
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,580
喬治·蕭伯納
George bernard shaw.

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,540
不明嫌犯使用社交網絡獵取受害者 我們能以網絡獵取他嗎?
So if this unsub is using social networks to find his victims,can't we use that to find him?

47
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,940
當然 假設這些女人 每人有100個在線好友
Yeah,if these women each had 100 friends following them,

48
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,880
那嫌犯會在好友名單的交集上 對嗎?
then the unsub would pop up on each of their lists, right?

49
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,370
John Fordham警探負責此事 他調查了所有人
Uh,the detective in charge, john fordham, he looked into their groups.

50
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,560
都被排除
Everyone checked out.

51
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,480
社交網站安全程度之低 讓人愕然
Social networking sites are surprisingly insecure.

52
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,770
Facebook最近試圖更新他們的隱私設置
Facebook recently tried to update all their privacy settings,

53
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,730
通過此舉 可把所有人的隱私文件 全部公開瀏覽
and in doing so, they made everybody's profiles viewable.

54
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,870
誰能解釋下 人們為何熱衷此類網站?
Can somebody explain to me the appeal of these sites?

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,710
"今晚我吃壽司 贊"
"eating sushi tonight. Yum."

56
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
"老大讓我加班 杯具"
"boss is keeping me late at work. Grr."

57
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,340
誰的生活會重要到 讓所有人都有興趣關注這些細節?
Whose life is so important that we'd be interested in this kind of detail?

58
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,160
我搞不懂 但一傳十十傳百嘛 沒有誰的生活那麼有趣
I don't know. I guess that's the running joke,right? I mean,nobody is.

59
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,700
但我們都寧願相信 的確有觀眾在關注我們的一舉一動
But we'd all like to believe there's actually an audience out there that wants to follow our every move.

60
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,460
某些網站還有內置的GPS功能
You know,some sites actually have a gps feature built in.

61
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,240
每當有人發表評論 就可以準確測出他的具體位置
You can tell exactly where someone is every time they post a new comment.

62
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,580
這可以解釋他獵取目標的方式 但無法解釋他是怎麼進入受害者住處
This is telling us how he's finding them, but it's not telling us how he's getting into their houses.

63
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,910
我敢肯定他配過她們的鑰匙
At the very least,I believe that he has copies of their keys.

64
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,050
Dorris Archer家裝有家庭安全系統
Dorris archer had a home security system installed,

65
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,890
但有人在凌晨1點56分輸入關閉口令 所以他也知道這點
but the disable code was entered at 1:56 a.M. So he knew that,too.

66
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,620
他還找到辦法搞定了她的狗
He also found a way to deal with her dog.

67
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,330
去年她從收容所收養了一隻德國牧羊犬 她失蹤那晚 狗也失蹤了
A german shepherd she adopted from the pound last year went missing the night that she did.

68
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,320
所以 這傢伙在受害者失蹤前 一定多次進出受害者的房子
All right,so this guy's gotta be in and out of the house well before the night of the disappearance.

69
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,490
他一定使了些手段 說服受害者讓他進屋
He comes up with some ruse, talks his way inside,

70
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,150
一旦足夠熟悉受害者的房間
then once he's familiar enough with the house,

71
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,750
他就會來綁架她們 毫無忌憚
he knows he can come back and kidnap them without disturbing anything.

72
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,520
哪些人進你的房間你會放鬆警惕?
What about the people who come into your house that you don't consider a threat?

73
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,580
房屋修理員 溜狗人
Home repair guys, dog-walkers.

74
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,450
對 Fordham警探也研究過這點
Yeah,detective fordham looked into that,too.

75
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,670
這些人根本都不是殺手型
No one even came close to being a killer.

76
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,230
好吧 Morgan和Prentiss 從最近的綁架現場著手
Ok,morgan and prentiss,start with the last abduction sites.

77
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,150
看能否發現他的作案手法
See if anything point to his M.O.

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,520
Dave 你和Reid以及JJ追溯受害者的生活
Dave,you,reid,and jj go back over the women's lives.

79
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,220
先從她們社交網絡的好友著手
Start with their friends on the social networking sites.

80
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,630
如果這是不明嫌犯獵取受害者的途徑
If this is how the unsub is finding them,

81
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,130
也許已有新的受害者上鉤 自己還沒意識到
maybe they're connected to him without even realizing it.

82
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,700
<i>愛達荷州 博伊西</i>

83
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,160
Fordham警探
Uh,detective fordham.

84
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,230
- Jareau探員? - 是的
- Agent jareau? - Yeah.

85
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,940
特別督察探員Hotcher Rossi Spencer Reid博士
- Uh,these are ssa hotcher,rossi, and Dr. Spencer reid. - How do you do?

86
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,060
謝謝你們前來 我們真的需要你們的幫助
Well,thank you for coming. We can really use your help.

87
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,630
有人願意跟我們談談受害者的情況嗎?
Did you find anyone willing to talk to us about the victims?

88
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,300
問題不是找誰談 而是不跟誰談
The problem wasn't who to bring in. It was who not to.

89
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,740
我們找的這個男人 可能通過社交網絡認識你的女兒
The man we're looking for might have found your daughter through her social networks.

90
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,690
- Paula提到過新認識什麼人嗎? - 沒
- Did paula mention anyone new in her life? - No.

91
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,920
有沒有現實中不認識 卻在網上關注她的好友?
No one who started following her as a friend, someone she didn't recognize?

92
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,540
我真不瞭解這些東西
I don't really know how those work.

93
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,230
有人給我發了電子郵件 慶賀Paula的晉陞
Someone sent me an email congratulating me on paula's promotion.

94
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,770
我還不知道她升職了呢
I didn't even know.

95
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,750
我就去問她 她說 "媽 我上周已經曝上網了"
And when I asked her, she said, "mom,I put that on my wall last week."

96
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,350
兩天後 她就失蹤了
She was gone 2 days later.

97
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,930
Samantha總是熱衷於更新她的狀態
Samantha was rigorous about keeping her status updated.

98
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,540
她沉迷於社交網站
She's obsessed with those sites.

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,430
那我想 她知道誰在關注她吧?
So I'm assuming she knew who followed her,then?

100
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,460
哦 天呢 不可能 她有一千多個好友
Oh,god,no. She had over 1,000 friends.

101
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,560
- 怎麼這麼多? - 我和她都是做房地產的
- Why so many? - We both worked in real estate.

102
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,190
她覺得這是個推銷自己的好辦法
She saw it as the perfect way to promote herself.

103
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,300
等等 那即使她告訴了所有人 自己的動態
So,wait. Even though she told all those people what she was doing,

104
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,190
她也不知道誰在關注自己?
she didn't know who was following her?

105
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,800
你有沒有覺得 自己郵件多得 都要淹死在堶惜F?
You ever have so much email, you feeling like you're drowning in it?

106
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,720
- 我沒有電子郵箱的 - 不是吧?
- Actually, I don't have email. - Seriously?

107
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,010
那我好好跟你解釋下
Then let me break it down for you.

108
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,170
這些網站就像抽了瘋的電子郵箱
These websites are like email on crack.

109
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,200
不可能和所有人都保持聯繫的
It's impossible to keep up with everybody.

110
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,320
有關你女友的失蹤 我們只有幾個問題
We just have a few more questions about your girlfriend's disappearance.

111
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,610
Dorris有沒有提過有人去她家?
Did dorris ever mention letting someone in her home?

112
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,940
比如說?
Like who?

113
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,060
我們在調查誰會知道 她家埵w保系統的密碼
Well,we're just trying to figure out who would know the code to her home security.

114
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,930
一定是某個她信任的人
It must have been someone she trusted with the combination.

115
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,880
不會的 她是個聰明人 總是做好預防措施
No. She was smart. She took precautions.

116
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,360
所以她才會養Bruno
That's the whole reason she got bruno.

117
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,050
Bruno... 那條狗 是看門狗?
Bruno... The dog. So he was a guard dog?

118
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,340
是的 她訓練了它六個星期
Yeah. She trained him for like 6 weeks.

119
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,860
好了
Ok.

120
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,070
我知道讓你看這個會很難受 但你看看有沒有不一樣的地方?
I know these are hard to look at, but do you see anything different?

121
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,050
罪犯可能動了什麼地方進入房子
Something he may have done to get himself inside.

122
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,330
- 這個不對啊 - 什麼?
- This isn't right. - What's that?

123
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,150
照片的位置 這是我們第一次約會
The photographs. This is when we first started dating.

124
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,280
右邊這張應該放在左邊的
The one on the right should be on the left.

125
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,640
好吧 會不會是她自己重新擺過了?
Ok. And she wouldn't have rearranged them herself?

126
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,730
不會的 她這麼放是有理由的
No. She arranged them a certain way to tell a story.

127
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,320
是告訴別人... 我們相愛的故事
It was... It was how we fell in love.

128
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,730
- 好的 JJ 我在搬了 - 看到了?
- Ok,jj,I got it. - You see it?

129
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,720
看到了 看起來他想把什麼東西 裝在牆上
Actually,yeah. Looks like he did try to hang something on the wall.

130
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,940
上面還有點殘留
There's even a little residue left over.

131
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,960
Morgan
Morgan.

132
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,230
- 回頭再打給你 - 好的
- Let me call you back. - Yeah.

133
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,350
- 怎麼 發現什麼了? - 嘿 這上面也有一個
- Yeah,what do you got? - Hey,I got one up here,too.

134
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,750
他想在那上面裝什麼東西呢?
What would he try to hang on that part of the wall?

135
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:15,790
站在這 我能看到二樓和樓下 暢通無阻
Well,from here, I have an unobstructed view of the second floor and down the stairs.

136
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,280
站在這堣]是 能看到整個入口處
It's the same thing down here. You can see the entire entrance.

137
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,870
是攝像頭 他裝了攝像頭
Cameras. He put up cameras.

138
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,630
我們認為這就是 他監視受害者的方法
We think this is what he's using to spy on his victims.

139
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,430
攝像頭體積小 價格低 容易隱藏 可以藏在相框 書 植物的後面
They're small,they're cheap, and they're easily hidden, behind photos,books,or plants.

140
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,940
錄下的片段可以傳輸到任何地方
The footage they record can then be transmitted anywhere.

141
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,850
你自己選的網站 甚至是手機上
Website of your choice, even your cell phone.

142
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,620
他還可以切換各個攝像頭 看到房子堛漱@切
And he can toggle between cameras to see everything that's happening in the house.

143
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,510
你們發現房子五個不同的位置 都有這些?
And you found 5 of these at different points in the house?

144
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,770
樓上 樓下 臥室 衛生間也有
Upstairs,downstairs, bedroom,even the bath.

145
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,990
他可以耍個花招進門 但沒時間裝五個
A ruse gets him in the door, but it doesn't buy him enough time to put up 5 of these.

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,070
對 所以我們認為 他會裝第一個面向前門
Right. That's why we think he starts with one camera facing the front door.

147
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,060
他就知道什麼時候進來是安全的
That tells him when it's safe to enter the house,

148
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,260
知道她什麼時候回家離家 遛狗人 什麼時候來 房子安保密碼是什麼
when she comes and goes, when the dog-walker comes, and what the combination to the house is.

149
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,900
這符合他的作案手法 他熟知受害人所有的社交細節
It fits his M.O. It he learned their every detail on social networks,

150
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,200
他會對這種監視上癮
he will be just as obsessive in his surveillance.

151
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,590
而一旦他瞭解了所有日程 他只需選好時間就行了
And once he learns their routine,all he has to do is pick the lock,

152
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,310
安裝好其他攝像頭 然後 他就對受害人的生活瞭如指掌了
put up the rest of the cameras, and boom,he got their whole life at his fingertips.

153
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,970
他怎麼處理那些錄像呢? 存著?
What does he do with the video? Maybe he keeps them?

154
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,460
如果他是窺淫狂的話就會
If he's a voyeur,yes.

155
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,180
啊 可窺淫狂一般不會有暴力行為
Ah,voyeurs are rarely violent.

156
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,930
他們興奮是因為目標人 不知道自己正在被監視
Their excitement comes from spying without the object knowing they're being watched.

157
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,700
罪犯綁架了受害人 也就去除了 發洩性慾的途徑 Reid說得對
And by abducting his victims, he's removing the outlet of his sexual release. Reid is right.

158
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,080
那這些攝像頭一定別有用意
So he must have some other agenda with these cameras.

159
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,680
也許他還和別人分享這些錄像
He might be sharing the footage with other people.

160
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,910
我們得讓Garcia查下 非法監視錄像的網站
We need to have garcia dig into surveillance in illegal video websites.

161
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,790
- 我要帶走這個 - 為什麼?
- I'm going to take this with us. - Why?

162
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,320
我們一開始側寫受害人之間 沒有面部相似點
We originally profiled there wasn't any facial similarity between the victims,

163
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,710
但我現在不是很確定了
but I'm not so sure that's true.

164
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,540
我想比對Dorris和其他受害人的照片
I want to compare dorris' picture with the other victims.

165
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,700
不明犯拍的這些錄像
These videos the unsub took,

166
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,300
有點像他傳到網上的一個 也許能幫我逮住他
it looks like one of them he posted online, which may help me nab it.

167
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,020
如果他放到了網上 你能直接追蹤回到他電腦嗎?
If he puts it on the web, can't you track that back directly to his computer?

168
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,230
正常來說可以
Normally,yes.

169
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,200
正常來說我能在17秒內 追蹤到他正在上的網絡
Normally, in like in 17 seconds I can get you the network he's using,

170
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,230
拿到他調製解調器的地址 然後突然之間 這世界就木有壞人了
get a physical address of his modem, and presto change-o, no more bad guy,

171
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,270
可是這個不明犯是個 恐怖的電腦發燒友
but this unsub is a creepy computer aficionado.

172
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,020
你們知道什麼是代理服務器嗎?
Do you guys know what a proxy server is?

173
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,230
是網絡中轉站
It's an internet relay.

174
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,730
正確 小孩子就用這玩意 避開被和諧的網站
Precisely. Kids use them to get around blocked sites.

175
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,810
一般來說一個代理服務器就足夠了 可這傢伙搞了幾十個
Now,usually one proxy is plenty, but this piece of work is using dozens of proxy servers.

176
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,670
中國 朝鮮 俄國 南非 都有他的信號...
He's bounced his signal off of china,north korea, russia,south africa...

177
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,970
Garcia 你能追蹤回到博伊西嗎?
Garcia,can you trace him back to boise?

178
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,380
當然能了 正在弄
Of course I can, and that's what I'm doing?

179
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,370
雖然很不幸地我需要點時間
Time is the unfortunate ingredient I need,though.

180
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,940
有了
This just in.

181
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,910
有一個存檔的代理服務器有信號了
Looks like one of the proxy servers archived

182
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,780
好像是Dorris Archer失蹤那晚的
what he was streaming on the night of dorris archer's disappearance.

183
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,230
- 我們能看到嗎? - 這就傳過去
- Can we see it? - Pulling it up now.

184
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,120
Prentiss和Morgan說得對 他對這房子瞭如指掌
Well,prentiss and morgan were right. He knows the house.

185
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,390
狗也認識他
And the dog knows him.

186
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,240
哦 拜託別傷害狗狗
Oh,please don't hurt that doggie.

187
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,570
要去過多少次才能這麼熟? 十幾次?
How many trips inside the house would that take? A dozen?

188
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,180
看到沒?
See that?

189
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,820
他身上裝著攝像頭 這是他的視角
The camera's attached to him. It's his point of view.

190
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,940
這樣他就能一次又一次地 重新體驗這一切了
So he can relive it over and over again.

191
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,150
有沒有人能告訴我結束了?
Ok,can someone tell me when this is over?

192
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,280
- 拜託 - 還沒
- Please. - Not yet.

193
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,960
他對她很溫柔 比起她活著 屍體對他來說更重要
He's tender to her. She means more to him as a corpse than as a living person.

194
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,770
Garcia 找到不明犯使用的網絡
Garcia,we need to find the unsub's network.

195
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,570
即使是大致區域 也能幫助我們縮小 地域範圍
Even if it's a rough area,it'll help narrow the geographic profile.

196
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,890
是 長官 我也正想找到他
Yeah. Sir,that's totally what I'm trying to figure out.

197
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,840
還有件事您需要知道
Uh,there is something else kind of huge you need to know about.

198
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,690
您看到這些代碼了嗎?
Do you see this line of code there?

199
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,780
看到了 怎麼了?
Yeah,what about them?

200
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,990
這能讓使用者管理網絡  也就是不明嫌犯 建立起一個聊天室
It allows the user admin, and in this case,the unsub, to set up a chat room.

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,270
人們能在謀殺案的當晚在線觀看
People were watching this on the night of the murder.

202
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,680
我們本來以為他是在事後上傳的 其實不是
We thought he was posting these after the fact. He's not.

203
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,400
他想讓別人和他一起感受這一切
He wants people to experience it with him.

204
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,310
他需要觀眾
He wants an audience.

205
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,650
他還有粉絲
He has fans.

206
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,740
能在這堸惜U嗎?
Can you freeze that?

207
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,250
他在向攝像頭致意
He's acknowledging the camera.

208
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
向粉絲脫帽致意 他知道他們在看
Tip of the hat to his fans. He knows they're watching.

209
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,260
典型的自戀行為
Classic narcissistic behavior.

210
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,930
他正在為觀眾表演
He's performing for his audience.

211
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,400
我們已經知道作案手法了 問題是如何實施
We know the M.O. The question is how.

212
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,780
什麼工作能讓他進入受害人家堜O?
What kind of job gives him access to the victims' houses?

213
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,380
一定和網絡有關 電訊的人可以幫你接網
It has to be network and I.T.S, the guy you let in to hook up your internet.

214
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,650
讓他進到房間 坐在電腦前
Gets him in their house and on their computers.

215
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,670
我仔細查過所有受害人的 網絡服務提供商
I went through all the women's internet service providers with a fine-tooth comb.

216
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,230
都是不同的公司 推銷員也不一樣
They all used different companies and no overlap with sales reps.

217
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,940
現場技術支持人員呢?
What about onsite tech support?

218
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,810
哦 都是清白的
Oh,well,clean as a whistle.

219
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,240
他們都有不在場證明 而且沒有犯罪記錄
They all had alibis with no criminal records.

220
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,910
我不明白他為什麼要在殺死那些人後 帶走她們的屍體
What I don't understand is, why does he take the bodies with him after they're dead?

221
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,320
把活著的受害者帶走 還解釋得通 但他已經完成任務了
Yeah,it'd be one thing if he took them while they were still alive, but he's accomplished his task.

222
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,400
他殺了那些人 完成了自己的演出
He murders them and he completes the performance.

223
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,660
那為什麼要冒險把屍體放到車上呢
So why take the risk of carrying a corpse to your car?

224
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,700
他一定還對屍體做了什麼舉動 或者想留下個性簽名 我們沒注意到
Well,there must be some postmortem behavior or signature or something we're not seeing.

225
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,950
我們仔細想想
Well,think about that for a second.

226
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,840
他讓很多人旁觀他的謀殺過程
He's sharing this murder with a crowd of onlookers.

227
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,290
而當他獨處的時候 他會怎樣對待這些屍體
What could he be doing to these bodies just for himself?

228
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,140
嘿 Garcia有信息給我們 說吧 姑娘
Hey,guys. Garcia's got something for us. Go ahead,baby girl.

229
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,100
好的 夥計們 我找到了一些東西 不過首先是壞消息
Ok,friends, I have some good news, but first,here is the thing that sucks.

230
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,730
我追蹤到不明嫌犯在博伊西使用的網絡 那是受害人自己的無線地址
I located the network the unsub is using in boise, and it is the victims' own wireless.

231
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,270
他在謀殺前 就侵入那些電腦了嗎?
So does he hack in before he starts with the murders?

232
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,790
黑進那些電腦太費時間了
Hacking is obscenely time-consuming.

233
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,270
你們看我黑電腦很容易 因為我是天才 可他不是
I just make it look easy because i'm a genius. But he's not me.

234
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,370
所以我猜 他在謀殺前 就埋伏進了她們的網絡
So my guess is that he's got to lurk around their network

235
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,290
至少得潛伏了好幾天到一周吧
for at least a couple of days to a week before he kills them.

236
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
他這麼干還挺聰明的
That's pretty brilliant on his part.

237
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,870
對 他知道如果我們追蹤他的網絡行蹤 只能查回到謀殺地點
Yeah,he knows when we follow his online paper trail that it'll lead us right back to the murder site.

238
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,970
好消息是什麼
What's the good news?

239
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,640
黑客們都有自己獨特的入侵技巧
Hackers are very loyal to their spoofing techniques,

240
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,760
如果覺得自己行蹤隱秘 便會重複使用同一路徑
and if they think no one's watching, they'll use the same roads over and over.

241
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,170
好 如果他再次借用俄羅斯 中國 朝鮮的服務器
Ok,so if he goes through russia, china,and north korea again...

242
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,540
我已經標記了那些服務器了 如果他再走同樣的路徑 我就能很快抓住他
I have flagged those servers, and if he uses them in the same order, I will catch him so fast.

243
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,890
只有他再次犯案 我們才能抓住他
That's only going to help us if he commits another murder.

244
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,450
- 是這樣 - 抱歉
- Yes,that's also true. - Excuse me.

245
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,790
Garcia 如果他再這麼做 你要花多久才能確定他的網絡
Garcia,if he does stream this again, how much time will you need to find the network?

246
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,090
哦 國際網很不穩定 我也不能確定 我...
Oh,uh,that's hard to guess with all the international pinging. I...

247
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,500
- 大概 - 呃 7分鐘吧
- Ballpark. - Uh,7 minutes?

248
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,840
不夠快 他作案只需要5分鐘
That's not fast enough. He's in and out of the house in 5.

249
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,370
哦天啊 那我就盡量縮短時間吧
Oh,god. I'm going to have to trim my time down,then.

250
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,010
Garcia 縮短時間
Garcia,get it done.

251
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,390
JJ 我們要召開一個記者招待會
Jj,we need to call a press conference.

252
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,030
既然我們知道他在殺害這些女性 就要把這個消息放出去
Now that we know how he's killing these women, we need to get it out there.

253
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,060
好的 我先篩選一下要召集的記者
Uh,all right, i'll,uh,prescreen the journalists I call on,

254
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,610
- 希望我們能控制住場面 - 很好
- hope we don't get anything out of left field. - Good.

255
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,210
我知道被害者之間的聯繫了
I know what connects the victims.

256
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,810
我仔細研究被害者的照片 我知道她們之間有某種聯繫
I was staring at pictures of the victims and I knew there was a pattern connecting them,

257
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,540
但不能確定是什麼 於是我使用了數學方法來分析
but I couldn't tell what it was until I broke it down mathematically.

258
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,950
為什麼我們都對名人的臉如此著迷
Why are we so drawn to celebrity faces?

259
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
因為他們的臉都存在對稱美
Because there's a symmetry to their beauty...

260
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,670
眼睛 鼻子 額頭到下巴的比例
The eyes,the ears,the ratio of the forehead to the chin.

261
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,210
這些比例越均衡 他們就越容易引人注意
The more balanced they are, the more appealing they are to our eye.

262
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,720
可這些女性並不是名人
These women aren't celebrities,though.

263
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,450
她們不是 可她們之間有共性
No,but there are similarities between them, and it wasn't

264
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,550
我掃瞄了這些照片 傳回匡提科分析之後 才完全明白了
until I scanned their pictures and got it to the guys at quantico that I had a full breakdown.

265
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,390
撇開眼睛的顏色 髮色 和膚色
All right,strip away eye color, hair color,and skin tone,

266
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,080
我們還能從幾何學上看出什麼
and what are we left with geometrically?

267
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,320
她們都長得有點不對稱
They're all slightly dystopic.

268
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,550
所有受害者的左眼都比右眼低一點
The left eye is slightly lower than the right eye on all the victims.

269
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,150
鼻子都很窄
All the noses are narrow.

270
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,200
額頭隆起的很相似
The forehead has the same ridge.

271
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,090
他可能都不知道 他究竟在她們身上看到了什麼
He might not even be aware that he sees it in them.

272
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,770
研究表明 我們選擇配偶時 都潛意識地
There have been studies that suggest that we pick our spouses subconsciously,

273
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,700
以我們看到的臉部對稱性作為基礎
based on a facial symmetry that we recognize.

274
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,090
所以不管有意無意 他發現了這一點 就要去殺死她們
So consciously or unconsciously, when he recognizes it, he has to destroy it.

275
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,090
也就是說 他只對身體有興趣 因為某些身體特徵與他有關聯
Which means he only has interest in the bodies as they relate back to him.

276
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,050
也許… 已經有所表現了
Maybe... They're a reflection.

277
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,290
記得在視頻最後他做了什麼嗎
Remember what he did at the end of the video?

278
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,720
他擦掉了眼淚
He wiped the tear away.

279
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,460
另一個他不該有的同情舉動
Another act of compassion he's not capable of.

280
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,570
他的自戀不會讓他這麼做
His narcissism prevents him from that.

281
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,620
在希臘神話中 那喀索斯太過自我迷戀
In the greek myth, narcissus was so self-absorbed

282
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,790
愛上了自己在水中的倒影
that he fell in love with his own reflection in the water.

283
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,190
沒錯 他尋找有同一張臉的女人
Exactly. He finds women with the same face,

284
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,300
掐死她們 再凝視她們死後的樣子
he strangles them,and then stares at them after they've died.

285
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,790
可他究竟看見了誰的形象
But whose image does he really see?

286
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,960
他自己
His own.

287
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,350
謝謝
Thank you.

288
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,100
我們認為使用網絡是理所當然的
Most of us take the internet for granted.

289
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,190
我們不會一直記得自己在 社交網站上分享和更新的文章
We forget about texts that we share or updates we put on social networks.

290
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,550
可是網絡把它們永久保存了下來
But the internet never forgets.

291
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,730
一旦上傳了 那些信息就永遠不會消失
Once it's out there, it's out there forever.

292
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,670
現在我們都知道那些 網上流傳的恐怖的殺人視頻
Now,we all know about the horrific deaths that get shown on the web.

293
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,080
謀殺記者
The murder of a journalist.

294
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,870
伊朗反對分子的投石事件
The stoning of an iranian dissident.

295
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,630
這些謀殺是不會為人所忘的
Those murders are immortal.

296
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,990
而這個不明嫌犯也渴求 被人同樣銘記
And this unsub craves that same immortality.

297
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,390
他在受害人身上看到自己的模樣 殺了她們 就好像在說
He recognizes his face on theirs and he kills them as a way of saying,

298
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
"我就長這個樣子"
"this is what I look like."

299
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,840
我們認為這也解釋了 他為什麼要帶走那些屍體
We think this also informs his compulsion to take the bodies with him.

300
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,840
他把屍體帶到第二犯罪現場 並在那保存起來
He takes them to a secondary location where we believe he preserves them,

301
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,930
所以每次看見那些屍體 他就能在它們身上看到自我
so that every time he looks at them, he sees his own ego reflected.

302
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,660
幸運的是 這也表示我們知道了他的長相
Fortunately for us, this means we have a good idea of what he looks like.

303
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:17,400
根據受害者的相貌 我們合成了一份大致的嫌犯畫像
Based on the shape of the victims' faces, we have a rough composite sketch.

304
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,650
這個不明嫌犯是電腦和家庭網絡的專家
This unsub is an expert with computers and home networks.

305
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,690
所以找找看電腦水平高超的人的犯罪記錄
So look into criminal records of men with extensive computer training.

306
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,610
我們知道 你們已經調查了 受害者電腦的通信設置
We know you've already looked into the victims' computer I.T.settings,

307
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,760
所以我們想擴大搜索範圍
so we'd like to expand the search.

308
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,230
調查電子商店 電腦經銷商 受害人就職公司的IT部門
Look into electronic stores, computer distributors,I.T.Departments where the women worked.

309
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,700
自戀的概念 在我們的文化中已經被濫用
We overuse the term narcissistic in our culture,

310
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,210
但這塈畯怍珨〞 是嚴格心理學定義
but we're going back to the psychological definition.

311
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,680
這個人的一生都是圍繞著 膨脹的自我而建立的
Every aspect of this man's life has been constructed around an inflated sense of self.

312
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,570
這樣的不明嫌犯容很易受到 自戀性損傷的傷害
Unsubs like this are particularly vulnerable to what's called narcissistic injury.

313
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,700
一旦他的自我價值受到攻擊或損傷 他就會抓狂
If his self-worth is attacked or damaged, he will lash out.

314
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,760
所以 如果你發現了這個不明嫌犯 不要公開挑戰他
So,if you find this unsub, do not challenge him publicly.

315
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,030
就說你只是想和他聊聊
Say you just want to talk him,

316
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,020
問他知不知道是哪個聰明絕頂的天才 跟蹤著這些女人
see if he knows anything about the brilliant mastermind who's stalking these women.

317
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,650
不管在什麼情況下都不要詆毀他
Under no circumstances should you denigrate him.

318
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,090
這雖然很不容易 但我們需要 誇讚他的戰績以示尊敬
As difficult as it is, we need to talk up his exploits as if we respected him.

319
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,390
這是我們正在尋找的男人的素描
This is a sketch of the man we're looking for.

320
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,520
白人男性 大約5英尺10
He is a white male, roughly 5'10".

321
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,270
對電腦和網絡技術非常熟悉
He's highly skilled with computers and networks.

322
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:31,040
我們建議大家監控好 上傳到社交網絡的個人資料
We encourage everyone to monitor the information they post about themselves on social networks.

323
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,580
不要寫下自己的詳細行程記錄
Do not document the details of your day.

324
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,660
不要上傳自己的 朋友的 或者家人的照片
Don't post pictures of yourself,friends,or family.

325
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,140
好了 可以問問題了 你?
All right,we'll take some questions. Yeah?

326
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,430
既然沒有目擊者 那FBI是怎麼得出這份素描的?
How did the fbi generate this sketch if there were no eyewitnesses?

327
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,870
是從我們修復的一段視頻中 得出的大概圖像
It's a approximation based on a video we recovered.

328
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,010
好了 你 你的問題是?
Ok,yeah, what's your question?

329
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,750
謠言說他與受害者的臉部特徵 有某種對稱性 能發表一下意見嗎?
Can you comment on the rumor he has some sort of facial symmetry with his victims?

330
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,830
他和受害者們長得像嗎?
Does he look like them?

331
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,030
到現在為止 博伊西警方有幾個不同的理論
Right now the boise police are pursuing several theories.

332
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,380
就是說你不否認
That's not a no.

333
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,420
為什麼他要把長得像他的女人當目標?
Why would he target women who look like him?

334
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,760
現在猜測他為什麼 怎麼樣 選擇受害者還言之過早
It's too soon to speculate on how or why he chooses his victims.

335
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,750
那人們要怎麼保護自己啊 整容嗎?
Well,what should people do to protect themselves,change their face?

336
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,290
不 注意更新自己的網絡安全 和謹慎處理自己上傳的東西
No,just update your online security and be vigilant about what you post.

337
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,850
好了 問題問完了 謝謝大家
All right,we're done with questions. Thank you.

338
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,800
Hotch 有人洩露了我們的側寫
Hotch. Somebody leaked our profile.

339
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,270
記者們在問關於臉部對稱性的問題
The press started asking questions about facial symmetry.

340
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,720
一定是你們當中的警員
It must have been one of your officers.

341
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,720
我的人之前是在看他們的手機 但只是慣性動作而已
Look,my guys were checking their cell phones, but that's just habit now.

342
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,380
我可以私下單獨的和媒體說一下 10點鐘新聞暫時可以不播出來 但...
All right,I can talk to the press independently, I can keep this off the 10:00 news,but...

343
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,260
我知道 剛剛是直播
I know. It went out live.

344
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,630
他沒看到的機會有多大?
Well,what are the chances he didn't see it?

345
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,800
情況不樂觀
Not good.

346
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,960
你這狡猾的神經病
Oh,your crafty little sicko.

347
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,650
長官 你打來得剛好 我剛琢磨出來...
Sir,it's fantastic you called. I just figured out...

348
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,910
你知道怎麼控制網絡了嗎?
How are you doing on pinning down the networks?

349
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,250
我剛剛正想告訴你
Ok,that's what I'm trying to tell you.

350
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,920
記得我跟你說過 他是怎麼通過 不同的服務器 來隱瞞自己信號的嗎?
Remember how I said he was spoofing his signal off different servers?

351
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,850
其中的某些 只不過是陷阱 用來消磨我的時間的
Well,it turns out some of those are a decoy meant to waste my time.

352
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,470
就是說 你能用更短的時間找到他?
So does that mean you can find him faster?

353
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,390
是的 是的 我能寫一個程序 篩選掉他的這些陷阱...
Totally. Totally. I can write a program that filters out the decoys...

354
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,990
- 噢 糟糕 - 是他嗎?
- Oh,crap. - Is that him?

355
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,000
是的 我要同時篩選這個
Yeah. Ok. It looks like I'm gonna have to filter this on the fly.

356
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,350
- 你能把視頻發給我們嗎? - 我想我能在烏克蘭境內攔截它
- Can you send us the feed? - I think I can intercept it in ukraine.

357
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,720
他在現場直播
He's going live.

358
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,040
看看他走路的方式 不像之前那樣不慌不忙 他被激怒了
Look at the way he's moving. He's not slow and deliberate. This guy's pissed.

359
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,630
我們能看出什麼? 有什麼明顯的標誌
All right,what do we see? Determining markers.

360
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,980
- 一層樓的別墅 - 哪都有可能
- A one-story cottage. - It could be anywhere.

361
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,180
有門牌號嗎?
Is there a number on the house?

362
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,710
- 沒有 他已經到門口了 - Garcia
- No,and he's already at the door. - Garcia.

363
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,170
他的代理服務器數量增加了一倍
He's using twice as many proxy servers.

364
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,270
等等 那下面的窗口 是個聊天室嗎?
Wait. This window here on the bottom... Is that the chat room?

365
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,550
- 她在這 - 他已經進屋了 同志們
- There she is. - He's in the house,guys.

366
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,480
他完全改變了他的作案手法 作案時間提早太多了
He's completely changed his M.O. It is way too early.

367
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,160
光線充足 發生什麼事了?
There's too much light. What happened?

368
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,830
有人在記者會上問錯問題了
Someone asked the wrong question at the press conference.

369
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,440
天啊 轉身啊 轉過來啊
Oh,my god,turn around. Just turn around.

370
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,980
或許她能擊退他
Maybe she can fend him off.

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,970
新的廚房用具 我們能從訂單上追查它們嗎?
New kitchen appliances. Can we track them through work orders?

372
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,200
- 查到的時候他早走了 - Garcia 給我們點什麼吧
- He'll be gone by then. - Garcia,give us something.

373
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,820
我已經追到國內了 快到愛達荷了 還需要一點時間
I'm stateside now. I'm almost to idaho.I just need more time.

374
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,700
- 你追不上的了 - 會的 我會的 我會的 我...
- You're not gonna make it. - Yes,I will. I will. I...

375
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,230
別管不明嫌犯了 你能追查在聊天室堛漱H嗎?
Forget the unsub. Can you run a trace on everybody in the chat room?

376
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,760
我不能兩個一起做 長官 讓我完成這個吧
I can't do both,sir. Let me do this.

377
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,740
Garcia 標記上正在看的人 這是命令
Garcia,tag the viewers. That's an order.

378
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,980
寶貝姑娘 沒事的
Baby girl,it's gonna be ok.

379
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,690
不 不 有事 我身邊死那麼多人已經夠糟糕的了
No,no,it's not. It's bad enough that there's been so much death around me,

380
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,130
但這個人 在我頭上動土 他真的很厲害 但太可怕了
but this guy is all up in my turf, and he's really good at what he does for really awful reasons.

381
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,340
所以你要把聊天室 那些變態觀眾都揪出來
That's why you're gonna find the perverts that watched it happen in that chat room,

382
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,840
我們會把他們掰倒 他們就會供出不明嫌犯
and we'll nail them to the wall and they're gonna give up the unsub.

383
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,260
不不 這樣還不夠 我要看著他受罪
No,no,that is not good enough. I want to watch him suffer.

384
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,570
我要看著他流血
I want to watch him bleed.

385
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,310
- 噢天吶 我嚇著自己了 - 很好啊 這是好事
- Oh,god,I just scared myself. - Good. That's a good thing.

386
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,290
因為我得到的教訓 就是你最不應該得罪的
Because if there's one thing i've learned the hard way is the last person you want to tick off

387
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,620
就是Penelope Garcia小姐
is miss penelope garcia.

388
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,980
- 你是在表揚我 是吧? - 是的
- That's a compliment, right? - Yes,it is.

389
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,500
相信我們會打敗這人的
We will beat this guy. Believe that.

390
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,030
- 我們查到什麼再給你打電話吧 - 好的
- Now,i'll call you when we've got something. - Ok.

391
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,680
她叫Allison Kittridge 29歲 這是她買的第一套房子
Her name was allison kittridge,29. This was her first house.

392
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,220
不明嫌犯加快了作案時間 升級了作案手法
All right,so this unsub accelerated his timetable and his M.O.

393
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,890
他加速是因為他生氣了
He was moving faster because he was angry.

394
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,620
是的 記者們說了些他不樂意聽到的話 所以他匆忙了事
Yeah. The press conference told him something about himself he didn't like, so he rushed.

395
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,040
意味著他犯了錯誤 那錯誤是什麼呢?
Which means he made a mistake. Now,what was it?

396
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,120
不是攝像頭 他把它們帶走了
Well,it wasn't the cameras. He remembered to take those with him.

397
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,510
不是屍體 他把她也帶走了
It wasn't the body. He took that with him,too.

398
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,120
嘿 Allison的無線接收器 Garcia有沒有發現不尋常的地方?
Hey,did,uh,garcia find anything unusual with allison's wireless?

399
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,820
沒 記錄上顯示的是一個基本的DSL裝置
No. Records show that it was a basic dsl installation.

400
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,180
- Prentiss 幫我搬開這桌子 - 好的
- Hey,prentiss.Help me move this table. - Yeah.

401
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,210
發現什麼了嗎?
What do you got?

402
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,600
你看到這堻o條線嗎?
You see this line right here?

403
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,460
是的?
Yeah.

404
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,940
網絡通過這條線接入室內
This is what brings the internet from the street into the house.

405
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,100
- 然後呢? - 這個不是DSL
- Ok. So? - This isn't dsl.

406
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,720
- 它不是? - 它是一條光纖線啊
- It's not? - It's a fiber-optic cable.

407
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,020
完全不一樣的連接
Completely different type of connection.

408
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,520
我們發現他犯的錯誤了
We just found his mistake.

409
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,210
如果屋堨豪荋N有網絡連接 他為什麼要帶上他自己的呢?
If there's already an internet connection in the house, why does he bring his own with him?

410
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,440
為了上傳速率嗎?
Is it the upload speed?

411
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,680
光纖可以讓他同步直播大量視頻
Fiber-optic allows him to stream large amounts of video.

412
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,910
同時開著聊天室
And maintain a chat room.

413
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,500
一次就有一大堆的電腦和他聯絡
That's dozens of computers connected to him at once.

414
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,920
為此 他需要很大的帶寬
He'd need a lot of bandwidth for something like that.

415
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,460
我們查了所有的網絡服務提供商 為什麼沒查到他?
We checked all the isps. Why didn't he turn up?

416
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,100
我老收到郵件 電話 甚至有人上門推銷 要我升級自己的網絡
I get mail,phone calls, people knock on my door all the time to see if I want to upgrade my internet.

417
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,300
是啊 我也是
Yeah,I get them,too.

418
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,440
他們會提出進屋演示 自己的聯接服務能比之前快多少
And they'll offer to come inside and demonstrate how much faster their connection is.

419
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,200
你認為他就是靠這幌子登堂入室的?
You think that's the ruse that gets him in the door?

420
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,630
這說得通啊 演示過程中 他有機會接近受害人的電腦
It makes sense. During his demonstration, he would have access to his victims' computers.

421
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,370
出門的時候 他要瓶水喝
On his way out, he asks for a glass of water,

422
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,240
支開主人 就有足夠時間 去放置第一個攝像頭
a distraction,something to buy enough time to plant that first camera.

423
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,780
我們得找出這光纖電纜是哪個公司的
We need to find out what company owns this cable.

424
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,300
Fordham探長已經在查了
Detective fordham's already hunting that down,

425
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,430
電纜上有ID號 所以應該不會要很長時間
and there's an I.D.Number on it,so it shouldn't take long.

426
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,690
JJ和Reid做下跟蹤吧
We'll have jj and reid follow up.

427
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,490
你倆去跟蹤當時聊天室堛漱H
I need you two to track down who was in the chat room.

428
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,590
Garcia掃瞄完了麼?
Garcia finished her sweep?

429
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,410
是的 大部分是國際的 三個是本地的
Yeah. Most were international. 3 were local.

430
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,060
我賭他們中有一個認識不明疑犯
I bet one of them knows the unsub.

431
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,940
FBI 我們有逮捕令
Fbi. We have a warrant.

432
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,750
有什麼可幫忙的麼?
Help you gentlemen?

433
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,500
- Austin Chapman? - 是的 是我
- Austin chapman? - Yeah,that's me.

434
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,450
FBI 關於你昨晚看的某段視頻 我們要跟你談談
Fbi. We need talk to you about a video you watched last night.

435
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,420
不好意思 什麼視頻?
I'm sorry. What video?

436
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,740
這是搜查令 我們有權搜查你名下所有電腦
This is a warrant for all the computers in your possession.

437
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,830
你因從犯謀殺被捕了
You're under arrest for accessory to murder.

438
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,110
從犯?
Accessory?

439
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,220
在線觀看謀殺 並且不作為 是重罪
Watching a murder happen online and doing nothing about it is a felony.

440
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,810
我不懂你在講什麼 什麼謀殺?
I don't know what you're talking about. What murder?

441
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,320
是的 這是我們的電纜
Yes,this is our cable.

442
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,890
Hightower夫人 我們看了你們的記錄
Mrs. Hightower,we went over your records,

443
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,780
4個受害人中 沒人使用你們的電纜
and it turns out that none of the 4 victims signed up with your service.

444
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,400
4個? 天啊 這些可憐的女人們
4? God,those poor women.

445
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,150
我們認為是你們的一個僱員 用你們的電纜作幌子進入房間
We think it's an employee using your cable as a ruse to get into the house.

446
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,890
- 你能想到有誰... - Mac Jones
- Can you think of any... - Mac jones.

447
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,610
他在我們的一部卡車上工作 我們把光纖和普通電話線捆綁接入
Uh,he worked on one of our trucks as we laid the fiber in with the regular phone line.

448
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,860
你確定是他麼?
And you're certain that it's him?

449
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,920
我們抓到他囤積電纜 他說這是為了一個家庭項目
We caught him hoarding it. He said it was for a home project.

450
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:23,710
直到我們接到投訴電話 說他拿著這些 挨家挨戶推銷免費光纖接入
Until we got angry phone calls that he was going door to door offering free fiber-optic installation.

451
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,650
- 我們當時就炒了他 - 我們需要他的資料
- We fired him on the spot. - We need his information.

452
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,870
沒問題
Absolutely.

453
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,960
女士們先生們 會見一下Mac Jones
Ladies and gentlemen, meet mac jones.

454
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,000
這不是我們從電話公司得到的身份證號
That isn't the I.D. We got from the phone company.

455
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,570
那是因為去年 Jones先生的身份證明被偷了
That's because last year mr. Jones had his identity stolen.

456
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,300
不明疑犯拿著他的證件和信用卡 用了2個星期 然後就不用了
The unsub took his license and his credit card, used them for 2 weeks, and then moved on.

457
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,030
我不能確定 不明疑犯正在冒充誰
Now,I can't tell you who the unsub is pretending to be now,

458
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,900
但是 一張圖片勝過萬千數據 我能告訴你們他是誰
but since a picture's worth a thousand databases, I can tell you who he was.

459
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,260
Robert Johnson 3進宮 由於擁有酷刑視頻被拘捕
Robert johnson,3-time loser, arrested for possession of torture videos.

460
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,980
在過渡教習所待了一段時間 就不見了
Spent some time in a halfway house before he disappeared.

461
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,060
我找到了他的一個博客 有這麼一句話...
I found a blog of his online. Here's a quote...

462
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,570
"下一次 你就阻止不了我了"
"next time you won't be able to stop me."

463
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,070
他又自戀了
That's his narcissism again.

464
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,790
對於被捕一事 他很憤怒 便把自己改造成了一個殺手
Furious that he got caught and he remakes himself as a killer.

465
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,900
這讓他得以釋放本來就有的衝動
It allows him to free the impulses that were always there.

466
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,400
Garcia 他盜竊身份 有什麼模式嗎?
Garcia,is there a pattern to the identities that he steals?

467
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,270
沒有 他非常小心
No. He's really disciplined about it.

468
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,960
一個身份一旦被用過 絕不會再用第二次
Once he burns through an identity, he never uses the same one again.

469
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,550
知道嗎? 有些嫌疑犯 完全無跡可尋
You know how I describe some suspects as being off the grid?

470
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,120
這傢伙完全相反 到處都是他的蹤跡
This guy is totally the opposite. He's all over the grid.

471
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,700
一切行蹤在他掌控之下
He's manipulating the grid.

472
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,590
而且他從不在同一地點待很久
And he never stays in one place for very long.

473
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,440
那我們現在要怎麼找到他?
So how do we find out who he is now?

474
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,830
我覺得找不到 這個叫 Robert Johnson的人是浮雲啊
I don't think we're going to. The man known as robert johnson is in the wind.

475
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,440
如果他和他的名字一樣多變 那就無需記住真名
If he's this flexible with his name,his real name,forget it.

476
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,080
- 但另有辦法找到他 - 是什麼?
- But there's another way we can find him. - Which is?

477
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,760
他的網名 他的黑客頭銜
His online name, his hacker handle.

478
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,620
這才是他在意的名字
That's the name that matters to him.

479
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,600
等等 他不會有成堆的網名嗎?
Wait. Wouldn't he have hundreds of those,too?

480
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,100
應該是 但還記得我說過 黑客很忠誠麼?
Most definitely. But remember how I said hackers are loyal?

481
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,510
他們偏好使用某幾個名字
They stick to certain names.

482
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,610
這樣才能向其他黑客證明自己的身份
That's how you identify yourself to other hackers.

483
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,970
FBI就是這麼逮到我的
That's how the fbi caught me.

484
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,520
所以如果我們找到這個黑客頭銜...
So if we find the handle...

485
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,580
我會找到不明嫌犯 我保證
I'll get you the unsub. I promise.

486
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:01,920
我希望我能幫你們 找到那個上傳視頻的傢伙
Look,I wish I could help you find the guy posting these videos,

487
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,580
但我從沒上過那個網站 哥們
but I never visited that website,man.

488
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,550
是啊
Right.

489
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,700
或許是有人黑進我的電腦怎麼的
Maybe somebody broke into my computer or something.

490
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,760
聽著 scott  我們認為是你
See,scott,we think it was you.

491
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,630
在你的硬盤媮晪鋮鴞n多有趣的視頻 更證明了我們的想法
And we found some pretty interesting movies in your hard drive to back up our theory.

492
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,300
"白人女孩不能上" 很好誒
"white girls can't hump." That's nice.

493
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,500
"辛德勒的拳頭"
"schindler's fist."

494
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:28,160
看 這個 這個可引人注意啊
See,this one right here,this is the one that got my attention.

495
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,540
"Sandy的性愛覺醒"
"the erotic awakenings of sandy."

496
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,090
視頻堥漱k孩才幾歲? 12歲?
How old was the girl in that video? What was she,12?

497
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,790
我 我可以解釋...
I... I can explain...

498
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,440
閉嘴!
Shut up!

499
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,450
我就覺得這個蹊蹺
This is what's weird to me.

500
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,020
你的大部分文件都是加密的 唯獨除了少女毛片
Most of your files were locked away, but not the child porn.

501
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,250
我們5分鐘就找到了
We found it in like 5 minutes.

502
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,850
沒有密碼保護 什麼都沒有
It wasn't password protected or anything.

503
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,340
像你這麼精通電腦的人 怎麼會做這麼蠢的事兒?
How does someone who's supposed to be so smart with computers do something so dumb?

504
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,780
我們能做個交易麼?
Can we cut a deal?

505
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,060
你告訴我想知道的東西 然後才有交易可談
You tell me what I want to know and the maybe we'll talk deal.

506
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,020
在他接受你進入俱樂部之前...
Before this guy accepts you into the club...

507
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,700
他給你一些非法的東西 孩子 酷刑
He gives you the illegal stuff. Kids. Torture.

508
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,000
他要知道你和他一樣願意冒險
He has to know that you're risking as much as he is.

509
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,770
確保他死你亡
Mutually assured destruction.

510
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,170
你把他供出來 他把你也拖下水
You rat him out, he takes you with him.

511
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,970
是的
Yes.

512
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,760
- 他叫什麼? - 我不知道 從沒見過面
- What's his name? - I don't know. We never met.

513
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,570
別想耍我 小屁孩兒
Don't you try and play me,kid.

514
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,070
他的網名
His online name.

515
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,590
偷窺者89
Watcher 89.

516
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,790
還有別的名字麼?
Were there any other names?

517
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,970
我沒找到過
Not that I could find.

518
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,470
我不會為毛片註冊 除非我知道是誰在操控
I don't like signing up for porn unless I know who's running it.

519
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,750
Prentiss女士
Mrs. Prentiss.

520
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,000
- Prentiss探員 - 還有件事
- Agent prentiss. - There's something else you should know.

521
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,380
他發了個消息 說今晚會是最美好的
He sent out a message. He said tonight would be the best one yet.

522
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,940
他今天晚上要發動襲擊?
He's attacking tonight?

523
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,100
當然 他知道你們盯上他了
Of course. He knows you're watching him.

524
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,980
他要來一場特別精彩的表演
He has to put on an extra-good show.

525
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:17,490
說點有意思的 Chapman先生 我們詢問了另外兩個人
What's interesting, mr. Chapman, the two other men we talked to,

526
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:22,360
他們的硬盤 都有某種形式的抵押籌碼
they had a form of collateral on their hard drive.

527
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,280
什麼抵押籌碼?
- I'm sorry. - Collateral?

528
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:28,090
赤裸的性愛錄像 違法的 充滿暴力
Hard-core pornography. Illegal. Rough.

529
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,250
我根本不看那東西
I would never look at something like that.

530
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,800
我的電腦都在你們那兒 你們一定檢查過了
You have all my computers. You must have searched them.

531
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,370
是的 我們什麼都沒發現
Yes. And we found nothing.

532
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,120
- 那 我能走了嗎? - 不行
- So,can I go? - No.

533
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,410
我得多問一句
You see,there's still that nagging question as to

534
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,300
你昨天晚上為什麼登錄那個聊天室
why you were logged on to that chat room last night.

535
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:52,440
Rossi探員 你瞧 留我在這兒純屬浪費時間
Look... Agent rossi, i'm at a loss here.

536
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,610
首先 計算機方面我一竅不通
First of all,I'm all thumbs when it comes to computers.

537
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,110
也沒準是高手 知道怎麼消滅蹤跡
Or you're very good with them and know how to cover your tracks.

538
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,240
再說 昨天晚上我的孫子們來過夜
Second of all, my grandkids were at the house last night for a sleepover.

539
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,830
他們8點半就上床睡覺了
They were in bed by 8:30.

540
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,990
我們都累跨了 我和我媳婦9點就睡了
We were so exhausted,my wife and I were asleep by 9:00.

541
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,620
拜託! 你去問問她 她也會這麼說的
Please! Ask her. She'll say the same thing.

542
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,590
我昨天晚上連郵箱都沒打開
I don't think I even checked my email last night.

543
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,820
認識這個人嗎?
Do you know this man?

544
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,610
認識 他前一陣來過我店
Yes. He came into my store a while back.

545
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,570
為什麼?
Why?

546
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,820
他說他喜歡我的網站
Uh,he said he liked my website.

547
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,180
那是我兒子幫我設計的
Which my son designed for me,by the way.

548
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,830
我們聊起了家電 他買了幾樣東西就走了
We chatted about appliances, he bought a few items and left.

549
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,740
- 他說他叫什麼了嗎? - 不知道 我們聊了差不多5分鐘
- Did he have a name? - No idea. We talked for 5 minutes.

550
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,090
我馬上回來
I'll be right back.

551
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,390
你相信他嗎?
Do you believe him?

552
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,600
他不符合對其他窺淫狂的側寫
I believe he doesn't fit the profile of the other voyeurs.

553
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,210
他們都精通電腦
They're good with computers.

554
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,450
都做過黑客
They have hacking experience.

555
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,300
Garcia檢查了網站 說是很粗糙
Garcia checked out the website. She said it's crude.

556
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,320
連訂單都下不了
You can't even order anything from it.

557
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,120
也許他說的對 不明嫌犯擺佈他是另有所圖
Maybe he's right. Maybe the unsub manipulated him for something else,

558
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,380
把他的網站作為自己偽裝的一部分
used his network as part of his spoofing.

559
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,460
- Garcia 請講 - 偷窺者89 我找到他了
- Go ahead,garcia. - Watcher 89... I got him.

560
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,890
他有自己的網絡?
Does he have his own network?

561
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,910
他不需要 他可以附著在全市範圍內的網絡
He doesn't need one. He's got a whole city to leech off of.

562
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,060
他今天晚上還要行動
He's doing this again tonight.

563
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,270
你能列出他最近盜取的賬號嗎?
Can you send me a list of networks he's hacked recently?

564
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,100
這些都是潛在的受害者
Those are the potential victims.

565
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,830
- 有20個 - 很好 除去男性和有家室的
- I got 20 hits. - All right. Filter out men and families.

566
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
- 他只對單身女性下手 - 還有8個
- He only kills single women. - 8 left.

567
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,610
Garcia 有照片嗎?
Garcia,do you have any pictures?

568
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,900
傳過去了
Coming your way.

569
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,830
- 她 就是她 - Lucy Masters 你確定嗎?
- Her. She's the one. - Lucy masters. You sure?

570
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,980
只有她的臉部對稱度能吸引他
She's the only one with facial symmetry that would appeal to him.

571
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,230
- Lucy Masters? - FBI! 我們進來了
- Lucy masters? - This is the fbi! We're coming in.

572
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,840
- 沒人! - 沒人!
- Clear! - Clear!

573
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,620
她人不在 但是車在
She's not here, but her car is.

574
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,390
它自己開的
It just went on by itself.

575
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,720
那是Lucy Masters
That's lucy masters.

576
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,940
他在給我們錄像
He's recording us.

577
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,590
歡迎欣賞我的節目
Welcome to the show.

578
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,840
Garcia 不明嫌犯正要退出 Lucy Masters的網路
Garcia,the unsub is working off lucy masters' network.

579
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,060
你能查出視頻要傳到哪兒嗎?
Can you tell where the video's being transmitted to?

580
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,770
沒辦法查 他不是用偷窺者89登錄的
I can't tell. He's not logged in as watcher 89.

581
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,970
他沒有用常用的代理服務器
He's not using any of the regular proxy servers.

582
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,420
多虧我眼明 才知道哪個是他
If I didn't know any better,I wouldn't know that this was him.

583
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,680
我靠! 他給代理服務器加密了
Damn it! He's encrypted his connection to the proxies.

584
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,300
我也無能為力了
There's nothing I can do to help you find him.

585
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,020
- 我們能看出什麼? - 金屬牆面
- What do we see? - Metal walls.

586
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,210
肯定是他處理受害人的另一個地點
It must be the secondary location where he takes the victims.

587
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,680
等一下 Garcia 能把她後面的牆面放大嗎?
Wait a minute. Garcia,can you magnify the wall behind her?

588
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,980
這個我能行
Yeah,I can do that.

589
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,570
牆上那是霜嗎?
Is that frost on the wall?

590
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,810
- 是個冷藏室 - 我知道他從哪兒找來的了
- It's a walk-in freezer. - And I know where he got it.

591
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,310
- 我們沒抓錯你啊 Austin - 什麼?
- We didn't catch you by mistake,did we,austin? - Excuse me?

592
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,160
你說不明嫌犯喜歡你的網站設計
You said the unsub liked your website, how it was designed.

593
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,330
但其實是你的工作
But it was your work.

594
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,920
你能幫他修理和修復的東西
What you can repair, what you can restore for him.

595
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,590
你給他提供了一個藏屍體的地方
You gave him a place to hide the bodies.

596
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,750
沒這回事 你去問我媳婦
That's not true. Talk to my wife.

597
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,770
我每天晚上6點到家
I'm home by 6:00 every night...

598
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,760
窺淫狂須知第一條
That's the first thing voyeurs learn.

599
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,410
如何毀滅蹤跡
How to cover their tracks.

600
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,320
如何在9點到5點之間跟蹤
How to stalk between the hours of 9:00 to 5:00.

601
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,750
所以你電腦上沒有小黃片
That's why there was no porn on your computer.

602
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,490
你有更刺激的東西
You had something better.

603
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,100
這是犯罪啊!
This is a crime!

604
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,970
你說的那些我根本不會做
I would never do what you're describing.

605
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,090
就算你不相信我 我媳婦也明白啊
And even if you don't believe me,my wife knows.

606
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,650
我兒子 我孫子
My kids,my grandkids.

607
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,070
我討厭電腦 我根本就不知道怎麼用
I hate computers. I don't even know how they work.

608
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,900
那我給你上第一課
Well,then let me give you your first lesson.

609
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,030
什麼東西一旦掛到網上 就永遠抹不掉了
