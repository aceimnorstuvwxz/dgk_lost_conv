2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,200
洛杉磯和奧蘭治縣
A heat advisory has been issued

3
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,100
已發出高溫預警
For Los Angeles and orange counties.

4
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,400
內陸山谷地區的氣溫甚至高達43度
Temperatures reached 110 in the inland valleys,

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,300
高溫致使電力需求不斷增加
Creating increased power demands.

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
市縣當局宣佈將按照輪流原則
City and county officials have declared shifting blackouts

7
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,900
拉閘停電應對高溫天氣
On a rotating basis.

8
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,300
洛杉磯水電局女發言人Karen Cramer宣佈..
L.A. DWP spokeswoman Karen Cramer announced ???...

9
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
要是不能按時恢復供電那該怎麼辦呢
What if it doesn't come back on?

10
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,300
只不過夜12點到3點拉閘停電
It's only going to be off from 12:00 to 3:00.

11
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,800
是啊 他們是這麼說的 萬一他們搞錯了呢
Yeah, that's what they say, but what if they mess it up?

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,900
打住吧
Stop.

13
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,500
- 但是 親愛的 - 別瞎琢磨了
But, honey, it's so--  seriously.

14
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,000
熱瘋了
Ohh...it can't get any hotter.

15
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,100
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,900
現在有38度呢
It's 102 degrees.

17
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,100
是34度 但是 好吧
92 but...OK.

18
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,100
再說 我們住在二樓
Besides, we're on the second floor.

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
什麼情況
What was that?

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
你待在這兒
You stay here.

21
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,500
你看到人了麼
You see anyone?

22
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,200
對不起
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
好吧 安靜一下
All right. Be quiet.

24
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,500
別打開門
Don't open it.

25
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,700
我沒這打算
I'm not going to.

26
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,700
這堥S人啊
Huh. There's no one here.

27
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,600
哦 天啊 天啊
Oh, God. Oh, God.

28
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,900
沒事的 風吹的
Come on, it's the wind.

29
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,500
走吧 沒事的
Come on. Come on.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,700
見鬼
Damn it!

31
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,600
- 呃 真有趣 - 抱歉啦
- Yeah, real funny. - I'm sorry.

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
或許刮跑了一個垃圾桶
Maybe a garbage can blew over.

33
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,100
也許是負鼠或別的什麼
Maybe a possum or something.

34
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,100
是啊
Yeah.

35
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,000
- 寶貝兒 - 怎麼
Honey. Huh?

36
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,100
你關窗戶了麼
Did you shut the window?

37
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
什麼
What?

38
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,300
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

39
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,800
嘿 Strauss想要什麼呢
Hey, what did Strauss want?

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
她要我們去洛杉磯
She needs us in Los Angeles.

41
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
昨晚發生了入室殺人案
Home invasion homicide last night.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
警官發現56歲的Gregory Everson
Officers found Gregory Everson, 56,

43
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,000
被毆打 頭部中槍
Beaten, with a gsw to the head.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
他的妻子Colleen同樣被毆打
His wife Colleen was equally beaten

45
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,700
並被多次強姦
And raped repeatedly.

46
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,100
- 多次強姦? - 她報案時這麼說的
Repeatedly? That's what she reported.

47
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,000
等等 她倖存下來了?
Wait, she survived this?

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,300
他選擇留她一命
He chose to keep her alive.

49
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,900
故意留下證人
An intentional witness.

50
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,100
這一切都指向其為有條理的罪犯
Everything but that points to an organized offender,

51
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,500
經驗豐富的罪犯
An experienced one.

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
她能夠認出他麼
Was she able to identify him?

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,600
她說他是白人 眼神猥瑣 氣味令人作嘔
She said he was white, with mean eyes and repulsive breath.

54
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,300
從堥鴠~都爛到家了
Rotten inside and out.

55
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
他在她丈夫眼皮底下強姦了她麼
Did he rape her in front of the husband?

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,500
是的
Yeah.

57
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,400
一起入室殺人案不足以讓Strauss
One home invasion rarely warrants Strauss

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,500
親自派我們去查
Personally sending us out.

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,900
不 還有更多 彈道測試結果與距離
No, there's more. Ballistics match a double homicide

60
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,300
48公里外的洛杉磯市區內發生的 一起雙重謀殺案匹配
Downtown L.A., 48 miles away.

61
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,700
3天前 兩名婦女被強姦後殺害
Where 3 days ago, those 2 women were raped and killed.

62
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,600
但昨晚是在郊區
But last night was in the suburbs.

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,800
他們擔心又出現一個暗夜魔王
They're afraid of another night stalker.

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Alfred Lord Tennyson(英國詩人)寫道
Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote,

65
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,900
"穿越層層黑暗
"And out of the darkness

66
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,800
"穿越自然萬物 是那雙手
"Came the hands that reached through nature,

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,100
"鑄造人類"
Molding men."

68
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
這傢伙的手法太熟練了不像是新手
This guy's way too good at this to have just started.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,100
他在不打擾到鄰居的前提下
He pulled off hours of torture and a homicide

70
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,400
用了數小時折磨並殺了人
Without disturbing the neighbors.

71
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,500
洗劫了受害人的住處
And robbed the house.

72
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,800
這可能是習慣使然
That could be a habit.

73
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
你覺得他是當盜賊起家的麼
You think he started as a burglar?

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,700
如果僅僅是想殺人
If it was just about the killing,

75
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,800
那他沒必要打劫他們
He wouldn't bother robbing them.

76
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
等等 他昨晚是怎樣入室的呢
Wait, how did he get in last night?

77
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,900
Everson夫人說聽到大門外有聲音
Mrs. Everson said there was a noise outside their door.

78
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,400
所以他們走出了臥室幾分鐘
They were outside of their room a few minutes,

79
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
等他們回來 他已經在臥室堣F
When they came back, he was there.

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
他轉移了他們的注意力
He distracted them.

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
因此他可以從他們臥室的窗戶爬進來
So he could climb through their bedroom window.

82
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
我要通知Garcia 看看他的犯罪手法
I'll have Garcia, see if that m.O.

83
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,300
有沒有在別的入室案件中出現過
Was used in any other home invasions.

84
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,100
呃 被害者情況各異
Well, victimology's all over the map.

85
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,200
3起謀殺案 他設法殺死了男人 女人
3 murders and he managed to kill men, women,

86
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,500
老人 年輕人 黑人 白人 拉美人
Old, young, black, white, Hispanic.

87
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,200
分佈相當隨機
That's about as random as it gets.

88
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,300
隨機意味著無法預測
Randomness implies a lack of predictability.

89
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,800
我認為這是關鍵
I think that's the point.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,300
他的犯罪對象是各種人群 他想傳達的信息是
All the varying people in his message.

91
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,400
他希望所有人都害怕他
He wants them all to fear him.

92
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
哦 他們會的
Oh, and they will.

93
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,800
輿論都聚焦於昨晚的入室殺人案
Press got ahold of last night's home invasion.

94
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
JJ和我去警局
JJ and I will set up at the station.

95
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,500
Dave 你和Reid去醫院拜訪Everson夫人
Dave, you and Reid go visit Mrs. Everson at the hospital.

96
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,500
Morgan和Prentiss 洛杉磯警察局的警探
Morgan and Prentiss, the LAPD detectives

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,200
正在Everson家等你們呢
Are waiting for you at the everson house.

98
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
你聽到了麼
You hear that?

99
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,200
什麼
What?

100
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,300
完全正確
Exactly.

101
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,300
我們做錯了什麼 犯罪現場竟會如此平靜
What's wrong with us that we're at peace at a crime scene?

102
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,700
熱得要命
Hotter than hell.

103
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,800
一定是技術人員切斷了電力供應
Techs must have turned off the a/c.

104
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,000
看到了麼
Huh. See?

105
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,500
哦 好啊 平靜了
Oh, yeah. At peace.

106
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,300
怎麼了 更多熱潮紅麼 夫人
What's the matter, more hot flashes, ma'am?

107
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,300
我很驚訝像你這種牛人不需要冷靜下來
Surprised a hotshot like you doesn't need to cool down.

108
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,000
大人物什麼時候能到呢
When are the big guns coming?

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,100
怎麼了
What's wrong?

110
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,700
你害怕他們會搶佔所有的頭版頭條麼
You afraid that they'll get all the front pages now?

111
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,500
嘿 我從來沒有那樣要求過
Hey. I never asked for that.

112
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,700
警探們
Detectives.

113
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,200
外面很多人嘛
Quite a crowd out there.

114
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,000
我是Matt Spicer 他是Adam Kurzbard
Matt Spicer. Adam Kurzbard.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
你好 我是Emily Prentiss 這位是Derek Morgan
Hi. Emily Prentiss. This is Derek Morgan.

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,900
嘿 謝謝你們飛過來
Hey, thanks for flying out.

117
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
呃 你們有什麼發現呢
So, what have you got?

118
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,900
我們忙得不可開交 這傢伙一周之內席捲全市
Got our hands full. Guy's been across the city in a week.

119
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,900
犯案似乎完全隨機
Seems completely random.

120
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
你不這樣認為麼
You don't think it is?

121
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
我們是紐頓分局搶劫兇殺組的
We're robbery-homicide in Newton division.

122
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,800
頭兩名受害人正處於我們轄區中央
The first 2 vics were right in the middle of it.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,700
唯一一個使我們趕到這堥茠漲]素是
The only thing that brought us all the way out here

124
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
- 子彈 - 還有人身攻擊
- Were the bullets. - And the assault.

125
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,300
所有的受害人均被強姦
All the victims were raped.

126
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
DNA匹配了?
DNA match?

127
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,400
他處理掉了證據
He covers up.

128
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
Everson夫婦拉閘斷電時
The, uh, Eversons were in their bedroom

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
正在他們的臥室內
Upstairs when the electricity went out.

130
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
那麼疑犯首先切斷了電源
So the unsub cut the power.

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
不是 水電局計劃輪流安排停電
No. They've got rolling blackouts scheduled.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
試圖不破壞全市電力供應
Trying to get through this heat wave

133
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,300
平穩度過這一波熱浪
Without the whole city going dark.

134
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,600
那麼這是不是他選擇這堛滬鴞]呢
So, is that why he came out here?

135
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,200
呃 人們都害怕黑暗
Well, people are afraid of the dark.

136
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
而他很可能借助夜色捕獲獵物
He probably preyed on that.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,800
好吧 燈光熄滅了  這傢伙就開始在門口製造噪音
Ok, so the lights go out and this guy starts banging on the door.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,400
為什麼要給他們這種危險信號呢 為什麼不直接闖入呢
Why give them the heads-up like that? Why not just break in?

139
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,200
他也許喜歡讓他們的腎上腺素分泌
He probably likes getting their adrenaline going.

140
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,500
這樣讓捕食變得更有趣
Makes for a fun fight.

141
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
聽起來他得逞了 妻子真的被嚇壞了
Sounds like he got one. Wife's real shook up.

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,700
我不認為她能有很大幫助
I don't think she's gonna be much help.

143
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
為什麼要限制她呢
Why is she in restraints?

144
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
她試圖自殺
She tried to kill herself.

145
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,900
先後兩次
Twice.

146
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
Everson夫人
Mrs. Everson?

147
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,400
我們是FBI
We're with the FBI.

148
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,300
我們知道你上午已經和警方溝通過了
We know you talked to the detectives this morning.

149
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,300
但如果你能回答幾個問題
But if you're up for a few more questions,

150
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,000
將很有幫助
It could help.

151
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,900
他為什麼不殺了我呢
Why didn't he kill me?

152
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
這與你無關
It--it wasn't about you.

153
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,400
這個人一心只想權力
This man only thinks about power

154
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,200
和控制
And control.

155
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,700
放過你正好滿足了他
Leaving you behind gives him that.

156
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,400
現在...
Now...

157
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,700
他有沒有當面和你說話呢
Did he ever speak to you directly?

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,900
他有沒有和你說話呢
Did he talk to you?

159
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,400
沒有 他真的沒有
No, he really didn't.

160
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
- 很抱歉 - 沒關係
I'm sorry. It's OK.

161
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,300
慢慢來
Take your time.

162
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,500
Greg看著我..
Greg looked at me...

163
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,100
以他習慣的方式...
The way he always did. I...

164
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,200
我們之間並不需要語言交流..
We didn't need words. We...

165
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,700
他只是...
He just...

166
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,700
看著我 我們都明白
Looked at me and we would know.

167
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,400
我試著堅強些 但是我 我...
I tried to be strong, but I--I...

168
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,700
閉上了雙眼...
Shut my eyes...

169
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,900
當槍聲響起 ...
When the gun went off, and...

170
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
這是Greg看到的最後一幕
That's the last thing Greg saw.

171
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,100
現在每當我閉上雙眼
Now every time I shut my eyes...

172
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,700
我都會看見他
I see him.

173
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,000
還要這樣多久呢
How long will that last?

174
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
你先好好休息吧
You rest now.

175
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,400
呃 我們將讓他上11點的新聞
Uh-huh, yeah. We'll have him on the 11:00.

176
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,600
謝謝
Thanks.

177
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
嘿 Rossi去哪兒了
Hey. Where's Rossi?

178
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,500
他正在與Hotch和Morgan交流
He's talking with Hotch and Morgan.

179
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,600
令人難以置信的詳細
It's incredibly detailed.

180
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,800
是啊 Matt Spicer警探還有他的拍檔
Yeah. Detective Matt Spicer and his partner are the go-to guys

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,100
是洛杉磯警局紐頓分局搶劫兇殺組的靈魂人物
For robbery-homicide, central bureau, Newton division,

182
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,400
洛杉磯最繁忙的人
The busiest in L.A.

183
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,600
Garcia的電話
It's Garcia.

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,100
嘿 Garcia JJ也在這 
Hey, Garcia, I got JJ here.

185
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,700
讚美上帝啊 洛杉磯
Praise the gods. Los Angeles

186
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,200
入室盜竊案發生率出人意料地低
Has a weirdly low rate of home invasion burglaries.

187
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
我發現了西切斯特的一件案子
I snagged a case in Westchester

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,500
有一個傢伙暴力撞倒了前門
Where a guy violently knocked down the front door,

189
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,800
踹了狗 搶走了電視
Kicked the dog, and took off with the TV.

190
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,400
踹開前門傳遞了一條信息
Breaking down the front door sends a message.

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,000
他試圖恐嚇受害人
He's trying to intimidate the victims.

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
是啊 雖然這個賊踹了狗聽起來很惡劣
Yeah, and as horrible as this dog-kicking burglar sounds,

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,400
但我覺得我們尋找的傢伙更可怕
I think the guy we're looking for is even more horrible.

194
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,600
Garcia 疑犯有過很多次的練習
Garcia, this unsub's had practice, a lot of it.

195
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,900
或許並不在洛杉磯  但他以前肯定幹過類似事件
Maybe not in L.A., but he's definitely done this before.

196
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
這並不是他第一次犯案
Word. This is not his first crime party.

197
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,800
我真的在洛杉磯找不到相似案例
I seriously can't find a single case in L.A.

198
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,000
符合這種程度的情緒宣洩
That equals this level of emotional destruction.

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,300
我們需要把搜索範圍擴大到整個南加州
We need to expand the search to all of Southern California.

200
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,200
他可能在任何高速公路網輻射範圍內的其他城市
He can be in other cities with a quick ride on the freeways.

201
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
- 好的 這就去查 - 謝啦 Garcia
Yeah. Will do. Thanks, Garcia.

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,300
11點的晚間新聞會直播這次的案件
We're going live on the 11:00 news.

203
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
你覺得他也會看麼
You think he'll be watching?

204
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,500
夜深時分他很可能已經準備再次出手了
It's late. He could already be hunting.

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,900
罪犯為何會選擇這個受害者 選擇在這一天犯案 選擇用這樣的犯案手段
Do you ever look at why this victim, why this day,

206
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,200
這類的問題 曾經困惑過你麼
Why this crime?

207
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,500
- 經常的 - 是麼
- Always. - Hmm.

208
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,400
有沒有想過他們可能只是在錯誤的時間
Do you ever think they were just in the wrong place

209
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
- 出現在了錯誤的地方? - 有時會
At the wrong time? Sometimes.

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,000
但我根本不信碰巧倒霉之類的說法
Well, I don't believe in coincidences.

211
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,300
此話怎講
How come?

212
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,600
別誤會 並不是說
Don't get me wrong. It's not like I talk

213
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
我參透了宇宙萬物法則
To the universe or anything.

214
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,100
我只是堅信萬事都有因果
I've just always believed that things happen for a reason.

215
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
但這起案件的來由真是讓人摸不到頭腦
It's hard to find the reason for this, though.

216
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
意圖不明的犯罪
Utterly meaningless crimes,

217
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,100
沒有明顯的犯案動機
No obvious motivation.

218
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,000
- 只是純粹的邪惡 - 邪惡在科學範疇內是無法定義的
Pure evil. Evil can't be scientifically defined.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,300
這是一種並不真實存在的 虛構的道德概念
It's an illusory moral concept that doesn't exist in nature.

220
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
這個詞的起源和含義
Its origins and connotations have been inextricably linked

221
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,800
和宗教與神話緊密相連
To religion and mythology.

222
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,900
沒有任何跡象顯示此次的罪犯 有任何宗教信仰
This offender has shown no signs of any belief.

223
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,200
- 我...我叫Spencer Reid - Matt Spicer
I'm, uh, I'm Spencer Reid. Matt Spicer.

224
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,800
Jennifer Jareau
Jennifer Jareau.

225
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,500
媒體一直等著想採訪你呢
The media's been asking for you.

226
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
那是因為這兒也只有我願意搭理他們了
Yeah, well, nobody else around here wants to talk to them.

227
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,800
大概是我還沒嘗到過苦頭吧
I figure it hasn't hurt me yet.

228
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
他們說希望能在11點晚間新聞直播採訪你
Uh, they'd like to interview you for the 11:00 news.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
- 你現在有空再過一遍相關重點資料麼 - 當然
Can we go over a few points? Absolutely.

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,700
好的
right

231
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,600
這兩個人是這周初被害的?
The first 2 victims earlier this week?

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
住在市中心 約凌晨兩點時遇害
Downtown. Killed about 2 A.M.

233
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,500
我們在日出時分發現屍體的
We found them when the sun came up.

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,100
不是午間?
Not at noon?

235
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,300
沒錯 風化科的警員 是早上六點到達犯罪現場的
Right. Vice were over there about 6 A.M.

236
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,000
家堛漕潃蚆曈ㄟ惘b了十二點
Both these clocks are stopped at 12:00.

237
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,600
那時曾經停電過麼
Was there a blackout?

238
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,900
昨晚才開始停電的
They started last night.

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,700
就是說是他割斷了屋外的電線
So then he cut their power.

240
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,500
而昨天晚上他則是利用了全城斷電
But he let the city do it last night.

241
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
下次輪到這堸措q是在什麼時間?
Where's the next rolling blackout?

242
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,300
若您正開車經過聖費爾南多山谷
If you're driving through the San Fernando valley,

243
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,000
敬請注意--由於需要輪流停電
Beware--the power in Glendale has just gone out,

244
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
格蘭岱爾市剛剛斷電
Thanks to the rolling blackouts.

245
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,400
不要走開 稍後還有更多資訊
Stay tuned for further details.

246
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,900
現在我們來看看天氣情況
Now let's take a look at the weather.

247
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,700
炎炎夏日的盡頭似乎仍然遙不可期
Well, the heat is not gonna break anytime soon,

248
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,200
氣溫在37攝氏度高盤不下
With temperatures still hovering at 97 degrees.

249
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,000
希望夜間能降至32攝氏度以下
Look for overnight lows to be about 90.

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,500
明天氣溫基本持平
Same situation for tomorrow...

251
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
開玩笑吧
Oh, come on.

252
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
寶貝兒 我們到家了
Ok, sweetie, we're home.

253
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
警方在上午十一點
Officers arrived at the home of Annie Danzi

254
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,900
到達Annie Danzi的家
Just after 11:00 this morning...

255
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,300
此次有一位幼齡兒童倖存
This time a young child was left behind.

256
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,400
洛杉磯警官Matt Spicer 是調查此次案件的負責人
LAPD investigator Matt Spicer is the lead on this case...

257
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,500
...將在今晨晚些時候由FBI的BAU小組開展
...HELD BY THE FBI's BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS UNIT LATER THIS MORNING.

258
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
這些側寫專家於昨晚到達洛杉磯
The profilers arrived in Los Angeles last night.

259
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,100

We're going live now to Annie Danzi's home.

260
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,000
有消息稱 FBI已經到達犯罪現場
We've been told the FBI has just arrived.

261
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,100
Jareau探員 Jareau探員
Agent Jareau. Agent Jareau.

262
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,500
這已經是輪流停電開始後的
This is the second home invasion homicide

263
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,800
第二起入室殺人案件了
That started since the blackouts.

264
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,400
您認為這三起案件之間有關聯麼
Will you confirm that they're connected?

265
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,800
你們計劃如何保障 這些區域內住戶的安全呢
How are you going to keep the residents safe in these areas?

266
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,800
我們正和市政府官員還有洛杉磯警方緊密合作
We're working close with city officials and LAPD

267
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,100
我們將探討決定進一步的保護措施
To determine what steps we need to take to ensure everyone's safety.

268
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,700
他們會決定叫停輪流斷電麼
Will they call off the blackouts?

269
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,800
這次不會
Not at this time.

270
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Annie Danzi
Annie Danzi.

271
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,800
30歲 單身母親
30, single mom.

272
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,900
她孩子當時在家麼
Was her child home?

273
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,800
Spicer正陪著他呢
Spicer's with him now.

274
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,700
斷電時間是昨晚十點到凌晨一點?
So the power was out 10:00 to 1:00?

275
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,200
還是那一套老把戲
All the same tricks.

276
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
- 有強行闖入的跡像麼  - 沒有
Forced entry?-No.

277
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,400
去年夏天實行過輪流斷電麼
Were there rolling blackouts last summer?

278
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,100
每年都這樣
Oh, just about every year.

279
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,400
之前出現過類似的犯罪事件麼
Anything like this happen?

280
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
炎熱和黑暗交加之時犯罪率總會明顯上升
Well, crime always goes up when it's hot and dark,

281
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,700
但是這麼嚴重的案件
But this?

282
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,500
從未出現過
No way.

283
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,100
在黑暗中出擊已經成為他的簽名了
Hunting in the dark is definitely a part of his signature.

284
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,400
- Garcia - 在
Garcia. Yes, sir.

285
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,100
請你幫忙查一下近幾年夏天輪流停電時期
I need you to check if there were any clusters

286
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,000
有沒有類似的入室犯罪
Of home invasions in previous summers

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,500
先查加州 再擴大到全國範圍
During rolling blackouts in California. Look statewide.

288
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
他這回留了一條訊息
He left a message this time.

289
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,000
你好呀(THERE漏拼一個E)
[HELLO THER]

290
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,700
萬事都有第一次
A first time for everything.

291
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,300
你覺得他留這話是在歡迎我們麼
You think he's welcoming us?

292
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,900
誰知道呢
Who knows?

293
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,200
至少現在每一個犯罪現場 他都給我們留下更多訊息
At least he's telling us more with each crime scene.

294
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,500
- 沒受過系統教育 - 強迫孩子觀看
Uneducated. Made the kid watch.

295
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,800
施虐個性
Sadistic.

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,900
儘管房間堥S有值得偷的財物 仍舊把房間翻得亂七八糟
Trashes the place even though there's not that much to steal.

297
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,500
暴怒
Angry.

298
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,500
選擇在暗夜奡M覓和謀殺受害人
Chooses to hunt and kill in the dark.

299
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,100
不願意被他人看見
Doesn't want to be seen.

300
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
為什麼
Why?

301
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
也許他對什麼事心感愧疚
Maybe he's ashamed of something.

302
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
但他也不用把這些相框放倒啊
Well, he didn't have to knock those over.

303
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,300
他不希望有任何眼睛盯著他看
He doesn't want any eyes on him.

304
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,800
除了那個孩子
Except the kid.

305
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,900
一定要逼他目睹每一件事
Didn't want him to miss a thing.

306
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
你手上拿的是什麼呀
What you got there?

307
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,000
是個機器人麼
Is that a robot?

308
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,100
是隻怪物
It's a monster.

309
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,700
怪物啊 它在幹什麼呢
Monster, huh? What's it doing?

310
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,300
是在保護你吧
It's protecting you, right?

311
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,100
他會讓那個男人離我遠遠的
It's gonna make the man stay away.

312
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
你有看清那個人的臉麼
Did you happen to get a look at that man?

313
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,900
還是床底下太暗了什麼都看不清?
Or was it too dark under the bed?

314
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
他把我關到衣櫥堨h了
He moved me to the closet.

315
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
媽媽叫我把眼睛閉上
And my mom told me to close my eyes.

316
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,900
你能給我示範一下你當時怎麼做的麼
Would you mind showing me how you did that?

317
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,900
做得好 孩子 你做得很棒
That's good, kid. That's really, really good.

318
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,300
所以你完全沒看到他的樣子是吧
So you didn't see him at all?

319
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,400
那個男人走了以後你是怎麼做的
Once that man left, what did you do?

320
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,200
你又躲回床底下了麼
Did you get back under the bed?

321
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,200
我不想把媽媽一個人丟在那兒
I didn't want to leave her.

322
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,900
但是你很害怕
But you were scared.

323
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,500
嘿 Carter
Hey, Carter,

324
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,600
你有沒有那種特別酷的背包
Do you, um, do you have like a really cool backpack

325
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,800
你可以放點衣物進去 然後搬去你表哥家住
You could throw some things in to take over to your cousin's house?

326
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,600
我屋奡N有
It's in my room.

327
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,700
你願意陪我去拿麼
Will you come with me?

328
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
聽你的
You bet.

329
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,900
嘿
Hey.

330
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,700
那孩子什麼都沒看到我真的很欣慰
Look, I'm really glad the kid didn't see anything,

331
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,000
那樣可能對他有好處
But it could have been helpful.

332
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
但當他用手摀住了眼睛
But covering his eyes like that,

333
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,100
就沒法來摀住耳朵了
That means he couldn't cover his ears.

334
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,900
強迫孩子觀看 這是典型的施虐型性格
Forcing a child to witness this is clearly sadistic.

335
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,500
他意圖毀滅孩子心中的純真 並毀滅他的童年
He destroyed the boy's innocence and took away his childhood.

336
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,000
不明嫌犯自己的童年很可能也是這樣的情況
This probably mirrors the unsub's own experience.

337
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
難道這麼說就能減輕他的罪責了麼
That's an excuse for what he's doing?

338
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,500
他的罪責無法被寬恕
There's no excuse for what he's doing.

339
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,200
我們並不是在為罪犯辯解
We're not justifying anything.

340
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
他的一切所作所為
Everything he says, everything he does

341
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,200
都能成為我們行為分析的依據
Tell us what makes him tick, that's all.

342
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,300
他在犯罪現場留下的訊息拼錯了
The message that he left us was misspelled,

343
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,200
這表明他沒有受過良好的教育
Which says that he was not well-educated.

344
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,400
他為什麼突然興起想要留訊息呢
Why did he leave one now?

345
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,100
原因暫時還不清楚
That we don't know--yet.

346
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,400
他最近都在洛杉磯犯案
Just because his recent attacks are in Los Angeles

347
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,300
不代表他是本地人
Doesn't mean he's from here.

348
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
他一定要等黑暗降臨後才能出擊
Killing in the dark is a must for him.

349
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,300
我們認為這也是他選擇洛杉磯的原因
We believe that's why he's come to L.A.

350
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,200
再加上他隨機選擇受害人這一點
That and his willingness to kill random people

351
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
我們認定他是一個機會主義者
Tells us that he's an opportunistic offender,

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,700
這種類型的殺手是極其難預測的
And these types are incredibly difficult to predict.

353
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,400
眾所周知 為使當地居民對此做好準備
And as you all know, the rolling blackouts have been announced

354
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
輪流停電會提前通知
So residents can prepare for the few hours they'll be in darkness.

355
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
不幸的是 這也告訴兇手
Unfortunately, that also tells the killer

356
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
這些住戶到時會窗戶大開並關閉房屋警報
Whose windows will be open, whose alarms will be disarmed.

357
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
黑暗是他的簽名 已經成為了他的習慣
The dark is his signature. It's a habit,

358
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
我們會發現這是他的嗜好
and we'll find That he's always killed this way.

359
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
因為他是個懦夫
'cause he's a coward.

360
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,900
某種程度上說 沒錯 他也同樣害怕他人親近
To some degree, yes. He also has intimacy issues.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,300
他甚至會把照片背離自己
He even turns photographs away from himself.

362
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,600
這樣的一個人
It's unlikely that a man like this

363
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,000
是不可能有過戀愛關係的
Has been in any kind of relationship.

364
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
也很有可能他有缺陷
There's also a good chance that he has some type of shortcoming.

365
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,000
無論是客觀的還是主觀的
Whether real or perceived,

366
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
他肯定在某種方面感到羞愧
He's obviously self-conscious about something.

367
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
- 比如? - 可能是生理缺陷
Like what? It could be like a physical deformity.

368
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
可能對我們來說只是很小的一件事
It might be something really small to us,

369
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
對他來說就是一切
But it means everything to him.

370
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,800
每個人都想融入周圍的人群
People just want to fit in.

371
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,000
有任何一處異於常人的地方
Having one thing that sets him apart from the norm

372
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,700
就可能導致其極端的孤立
Could be what led him into the extreme solitude

373
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,400
和強烈的自我矛盾的個性
Of a violent schizoid personality.

374
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,200
他通過剝奪被害人的能力
He takes his victims' power away,

375
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
包括機體和精神力量
Literally and figuratively.

376
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,500
在使他們感到弱小中感到極大滿足感
And he feeds off of making them powerless.

377
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,400
去年整個夏天我們都實行輪流斷電
We had rolling blackouts all last summer,

378
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
但這個人從未出現過
And this guy wasn't around.

379
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,700
但他現在卻出現了
Well, he is now.

380
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
以他的犯罪手段的惡毒程度
And based on the vicious nature of his crimes,

381
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,800
媒體已經將他命名為"暗夜王子"了
The press has named him the prince of darkness.

382
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
"王子" 這稱呼會讓他的自尊更加膨脹的
Prince. That'll fuel his ego.

383
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
是啊 他會出現在各大新聞中
Yeah. He's gonna be all over the news.

384
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,100
只要能找到他對黑暗依賴心理的原因 我們就能找到他了
Once we unravel his need for darkness, we'll find him.

385
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,300
他要是回來找我怎麼辦?
What if he comes back?

386
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,500
不會的
He won't.

387
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
他不會再傷害你了 懂麼
He can't hurt you again, OK?

388
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,400
你怎麼知道 你都不知道他在哪兒
How do you know? You didn't find him.

389
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,800
話是沒錯 但是我們一定會找到他的
You're right. But I will.

390
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,400
她應該識時務一些的
She should have known better.

391
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,200
你在說誰? 你母親麼
Who? Your mom?

392
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,900
她嘗試跟他搏鬥的
She tried to fight him,

393
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,500
但他手埵竟j
But he had a gun.

394
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,700
她為什麼還要傻乎乎地去跟他鬥呢
Why did she do that?

395
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,100
這個嘛
Well,

396
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,900
Carter 她想盡全力保護你啊
She needed to protect you, Carter.

397
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,900
做出這種事的人 是窮兇極惡的
The man who did this, he's very bad, OK?

398
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,700
我一定會將他繩之以法
I'm going to find him.

399
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,300
我保證 好不好?
I promise. Ok?

400
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
好吧
All right.

401
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:06,694
謝謝
Thank you.

402
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,700
是的 Prentiss 有什麼計劃
Yeah, Prentiss. What's the plan?

403
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,900
今晚按計劃還要輪流停電
Rolling blackouts are still scheduled for tonight.

404
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,500
那警方要怎麼巡邏?
How's LAPD gonna patrol it?

405
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,200
以他們接到的電話
With the number of calls they've been getting,

406
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,500
他們已經分散部署了
They're stretched thin already.

407
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,700
那他們得停止這麼做
Well, then they gotta cancel it.

408
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,200
那就是戰爭 要真那麼做
That's the battle. If they do that,

409
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,800
如果電網超載 整座城市都將停電
The whole city could go dark if the power grid gets overwhelmed.

410
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,300
你說的對 那樣不行
Yeah, you're right. That's not gonna work.

411
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,500
潛在受害者會大大增加
LAPD's outnumbered 10,000 to 1.

412
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,600
好的 有事通知我
All right, keep me posted.

413
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,400
有沒有告訴她我們明天 
Did you tell her that we're gonna need to talk to Carter

414
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,300
要和Carter再談談?
Again tomorrow?

415
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,100
他什麼也不會記得
He won't remember anything.

416
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,000
我們有心理分析員可以幫他想起來
We have psychological markers, things that could help him out.

417
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
你想讓他再經歷一次?
You want to make him relive it?

418
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
如果能幫我們抓到兇手 是的
If it will help us catch this guy, yes.

419
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,500
你也看到他了 他感覺無助脆弱
I mean, you saw him. He feels helpless, weak.

420
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,100
他也無能為力
There's nothing he could have done about it,

421
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,800
但他會一直責怪自己
But he's gonna keep blaming himself.

422
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,900
Carter不願表現出來
You know, Carter didn't reveal that much.

423
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,700
你怎麼知道?
How come you know all this?

424
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,500
因為我小時候失去過父母
Because when I was a kid, I lost my parents.

425
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,600
怎麼回事
How?

426
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
酒後駕車
Drunk driver.

427
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,400
你當時在車?
And you were in the car?

428
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,100
沒
No.

429
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
你似乎深有體會 好像你親眼見過一樣
You seem to have some insight, as if you witnessed it.

430
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,300
也許是因為我在腦海中想像過 無數次當時的場景
Maybe because I pictured it a thousand times.

431
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,100
我父母...
My parents...

432
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,100
他們 呃
They, uh,

433
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
他們在往家趕 因為我病了
They were racing home 'cause I was sick.

434
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,100
要知道 如果他們不是那時候上路
You know, if they hadn't left right then,

435
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,800
他們就不會走那個十字路口
They would have missed that intersection,

436
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,300
那堣]不會是紅燈
And there wouldn't have been a red light.

437
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,600
我失去了父親...
I lost my father...

438
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,100
在我9歲時
When I was 9 years old.

439
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,700
他在我面前被槍擊身亡
He was shot and killed right in front of me.

440
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,100
我也無能為力
There was nothing I could do.

441
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,200
所以我選擇這樣看待
So I choose to look at it like this--

442
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,600
我們的生命中都有重要的人
We all have people in our lives.

443
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
有些是好人
Some of them are good.

444
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,900
有些是壞人
Some of them are bad.

445
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,000
但是他們塑造了我們
But they shape us, Detective.

446
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,200
所以你才會戴上警徽
That's why you have that badge.

447
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,000
所以我們現在才坐在車
That's why the two of us are sitting in this car right now.

448
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,200
(謀殺案和輪流停電讓警力陷入癱瘓)
[murders and black-outs paralyze city of angels]

449
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,300
洛杉磯縣輪流停電時刻表
[L.A.county rolling blackout schedule]

450
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,400
孩子怎麼樣
How's the boy?

451
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
他很安靜
He's quiet.

452
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,200
現在會談還太早吧?
Too soon for an interview?

453
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,600
是的 我也想在這孩子再回想之前
Yeah, I want to find this guy before

454
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,900
抓住那兇手
we have to put the kid through it.

455
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,800
大傢伙兒 Garcia有發現
Guys, Garcia has something.

456
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,300
好了 大家都坐下
Ok, everybody needs to sit down

457
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
因為我要顛覆你的世界
'cause I'm about to rock your world

458
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,900
雖然是以我不喜歡的方式
And not in a way I like to do it.

459
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,900
我反覆查過 你說的完全正確
I have scoured and searched and you were totally right.

460
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,500
兇手以前就這麼幹過
This unsub has been doing it forever.

461
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
過去的26年他到處都去過
There is nowhere he hasn't been in the last 26 years.

462
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,700
我沒誇張 每個州都去過
Honestly. Every single state.

463
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,100
本土共48個州 在我看來
Well, 48 continental. My point--

464
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
他是我見過的 我們所見過的 最變態的禽獸
He is the worst I've ever seen,

465
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,700
怎麼把各個案子和他聯繫起來的?
And we have all seen some things.

466
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,400
你說的一切 他沉浸在黑暗中
How did you connect him?

467
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,400
Everything you said. He's drawn to the dark.

468
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,600
他在停電時出沒
He shows up during a blackout,

469
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,200
他搶劫 殺人 留一個目擊者
He robs, he kills, he leaves a witness.

470
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,600
那為何沒有引起警方注意?
How's he getting away with this?

471
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,100
犯一次案換一個地方
He never hits the same city twice.

472
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,700
除了洛杉磯
Except Los Angeles.

473
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,500
我把所有資料都傳給你了
I'm sending everything your way

474
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,700
快點開始打印吧
And you better load up that printer,

475
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,600
因為似乎他從1984年的夏天
'cause it looks like he started in Southern California

476
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,800
就在南加州開始行兇了
Way back in the summer of 1984.

477
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,200
感謝上帝媒體還不知道這些
Thank God the press hasn't connected this.

478
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
那年的夏季奧運會是在洛杉磯舉辦的
The summer Olympics were in Los Angeles that year.

479
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,700
Richard Ramirez也是 (美國著名連環殺手 外號"暗夜魔王")
So was Richard Ramirez.

480
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,000
他就是從那年開始的
That's the year he started.

481
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,300
他沒走 在洛杉磯住了幾年
Well, he never left. Stayed in L.A. For a few years.

482
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,700
好的 我去查
Fine. I'll look into it.

483
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,500
似乎不明嫌犯是從那個夏天
It appears our unsub started that summer

484
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,000
聖地亞哥的一次停電時開始的
During a blackout in San Diego.

485
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,300
之後他去了橘子郡
From there he went to orange county.

486
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,200
最後到了洛杉磯
After that he ended up in Los Angeles

487
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,900
之後一路沿著海岸作案
And then worked his way up the coast.

488
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,200
他為什麼要回來
Why did he come back?

489
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
為什麼要現在回來?
And why now?

490
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
又是炎熱的一晚
It's gonna be hot again tonight.

491
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,300
最好去車媞恅
You might be better off sleeping in your car

492
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
或是直接逃出洛杉磯
Or just getting the hell out of L.A.

493
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,700
黑暗中任何事都有可能發生
Anything to get away from the darkness and what happens in it.

494
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,700
我們要和阿卡迪亞暫時道別了
All right, we're about to lose Arcadia.

495
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,300
該區域將從晚九點停電至午夜
They've got that 9:00 to midnight shift.

496
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,300
查茨沃思將從晚10點停電至凌晨一點
Chatsworth, you're gone from 10:00 to 1:00.

497
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,300
您可以上網查閱完整時刻表
Check us out online for a full list.

498
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
我們一直待到午夜或是停電之時
We'll be here until midnight or I guess until the lights go out.

499
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,500
嘿 看啊 現在室外溫度37度
Hey, look at that. It's a cool 99 degrees here

500
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
準確說是37.5度
At 99.6.

501
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,900
大約10:15到的這?
Get here about 10:15?

502
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
聽著 我想讓你查查這街區
Listen, I want you to check the neighborhood,

503
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,400
看有沒有監控攝像頭
See if there are any surveillance cameras.

504
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
- 可能壞掉了 - Kurz
They may not be working-- Kurz.

505
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,300
謝謝
Thanks.

506
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,000
他留信了?
Did he leave a message?

507
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,300
那雜種留了個嬰兒
The son of a bitch left a baby in there.

508
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,900
活的?
Alive?

509
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,500
是的
Yeah.

510
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,800
嬰兒?
A baby?

511
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,800
是的 長官 非常感謝
Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

512
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,000
怎麼了
Hey, what's up?

513
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,400
今晚每家每戶都有電
Everyone will have power tonight.

514
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,800
他們取消停電計劃了?
They called off the blackouts?

515
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,700
鑒於早前發生的事 不可能再實施下去了
After what happened earlier, we can't give them that again.

516
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,400
- 太好了 我去告訴媒體 - 謝謝
Great, I'll tell the press. thanks

517
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,000
我們要說的是26年堛200戶人家
We're talking over 200 houses in 26 years.

518
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,400
他從聖地亞哥開始時 還只是搶劫
When he started in San Diego, it was all about the robberies.

519
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,600
等他到了橘子郡
By the time he got to orange county,

520
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,100
他搶劫並襲擊受害者
He robbed and assaulted his victims.

521
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,200
第一次殺人是在長灘 他留下了一名目擊者
First murder was in long beach and he left a witness.

522
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,800
他這26年一直逍遙法外
He got away with it for 26 years.

523
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,200
他為什麼要回來
Why did he come back?

524
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,700
大家好 有個好消息
Good news, everybody.

525
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,100
來電了
The lights are back on.

526
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,000
這就對了 黑暗王子
That's right. The prince of darkness

527
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
不得不熄滅亮光
Is gonna have to take the night off.

528
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,700
停電謀殺案的嫌犯仍未被抓獲
Still no suspects in the blackout murders.

529
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,100
但調查者們相信
But investigators believe

530
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,300
除去公開的調查之外 
there's a reason why he's stayed in Los Angeles

531
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,200
他留在洛杉磯是有原因的
Despite the publicized investigation.

532
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,300
謝謝
Thanks.

533
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
媒體的報道是有用的
Well, the media coverage actually helped.

534
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,200
鄰居們都很警覺
Neighbors were hypervigilant.

535
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,300
他們一聽到槍聲就報了警
As soon as they heard the gunfire they called the police.

536
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,300
他這次留言了嗎?
Did he leave a message this time?

537
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,700
是在衣櫥堛瑰成
He actually left a baby in the closet.

538
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
那一定代表著某種意思
There's got to be some kind of message in that.

539
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,900
他在羞辱我們 他留下的目擊者
He's taunting us. He's leaving behind witnesses

540
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,300
年紀太小 無法提供幫助
That are too little to help.

541
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,800
好吧
Ok.

542
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,500
為什麼是她們?
Why them?

543
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,300
為什麼是現在?
Why now?

544
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,400
他在輪流停電前殺了那兩個女人
He killed these two women before the rolling blackouts.

545
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,000
她們怎麼了?
What is it about them?

546
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,600
他在一片繁榮 明亮的地方殺了她們
He killed them in a busy, well-lit area.

547
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,300
跟其他的不一樣
It was nothing like the others.

548
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
紐頓縣的槍擊案發生率很高
It's, uh, shootin' Newton.

549
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,100
那堛漱H經常能聽見槍聲
People hear gunfire down there all the time.

550
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,000
正適合他作案
He probably fit right in.

551
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,400
是在你的轄區
It was in your division.

552
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,100
他總得找地方開始
Hey, he had to start somewhere.

553
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,900
你覺得只是巧合?
So you think it's just a coincidence?

554
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,900
好 先說不是巧合吧
All right, let's say it's not.

555
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,700
那是什麼意思 他想引起我們的注意?
What does that mean, he wanted our attention?

556
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,900
顯然我們已經夠注意他的
Well, he certainly has it.

557
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,300
你確定從來沒辦過這樣的案子?
You're sure you never working anything like this before?

558
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,100
相信我 他讓我印像深刻
Trust me, this guy makes an impression.

559
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,600
26年前 他就開始了犯罪生涯
He started his career 26 years ago.

560
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,200
跟我一樣
Same as me.

561
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,500
你覺得這都是因為我?
You think this is because of me?

562
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,600
所以才死了這麼多人?
That all these people are dead because of that?

563
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
你的轄區有2個女人被殺 沒有倖存者
Two women killed in your division, no survivors.

564
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,600
之後是一對夫婦 留下妻子當目擊證人
Then a couple, leaving the wife as a witness.

565
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,100
之後是母親 留下了兒子
Then a mother, leaving the son.

566
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,500
現在是一對父母 只有嬰兒活下來
Now two parents, but a baby survives.

567
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,900
如果這堶惘閉Y種模式 我可是從來沒見過
If there's some kind of pattern, I've never seen it before.

568
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,700
他重回洛杉磯一定有原因
He circled back to L.A. for a reason.

569
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,600
洛杉磯最早的兩起謀殺案的發生地離長灘很近
The first two murders here in L.A. county  were close by. Long beach

570
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,800
一起在洛杉磯的北部 一起在橘子郡
is on the cusp of L.A. and orange counties.

571
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,300
看看這一起
Let's look into that one.

572
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,300
住宅入侵 丈夫被槍殺
Home invasion. A husband was shot.

573
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,000
妻子存活下來
Wife was left alive.

574
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,100
聽著耳熟
Sounds familiar.

575
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,400
下一起呢?
What's the next one?

576
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,700
在長灘犯案之後 他去了聖莫尼卡
After long beach, he went to Santa Monica.

577
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,400
等等
Wait a minute.

578
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,100
Spicer 你那有親戚嗎?
Spicer, do you have family out there?

579
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,400
是的 我在那兒長大
Yeah, that's where I grew up.

580
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,400
入室搶劫 雙重謀殺
Home invasion robbery, double homicide.

581
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,000
Joe和Sylvia Spicer被殺
Joe and Sylvia Spicer were killed.

582
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,200
那是我父母
Those are my parents.

583
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,300
根本說不通啊
It doesn't make any sense.

584
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,200
讓我看看
Let me see that.

585
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,600
他們死於車禍 酒後駕車
They died in a car accident. A drunk driver.

586
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,700
誰告訴你的?
Who told you that?

587
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
我爺爺奶奶
My grandparents.

588
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
我記得當時我爺爺叫我起床
I remember my grandfather waking me up.

589
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,200
他們遇害那晚我病了 發高燒
I was sick the night they died. I had a fever.

590
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,800
我怎麼會不記得他們的遭遇?
How would I not remember that happening to them?

591
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,700
也許是你爺爺故意瞞著你 Matt
Maybe your grandparents never told you, Matt.

592
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,000
他們是想保護你
They were trying to protect you.

593
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,100
他們騙我?
They lied?

594
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,600
你是他留下的第一個活口
You were the first child he left alive.

595
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,400
你被廣泛報導
You've been all over the news.

596
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,700
他知道你是誰
This guy knows who you are.

597
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
簡直瘋了
This is crazy.

598
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,400
聽著 當Carter說不明嫌犯逼著他
Look, when Carter said that the unsub

599
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
從衣櫥堜馴~看
made him watch from the closet,

600
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
你退縮了
You flinched.

601
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
你不是嗎?
And you didn't?

602
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
這傢伙在奚落你
This guy is taunting you.

603
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,300
他留了一個小男孩 現在又留了個嬰兒
He left a young boy alive and now a baby.

604
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,100
他想讓你知道是他
He wants you to know it's him.

605
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,500
我怎麼會不知道呢?
How could I not know?

606
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,400
你知道的 埋得很深
You did. Deep down.

607
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,400
但你小時候受過巨大的心理創傷
But you went through a major trauma as a kid.

608
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,600
你信奉了另外一個故事 因為那個讓你好受些
You believed the story because it was easier.

609
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,900
那現在呢?
And now what?

610
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,300
你想讓我想起真正發生了什麼嗎?
You want to make me remember what really happened?

611
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,800
拜託 都是26年前的事了
I mean, come on, it was 26 years ago.

612
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,200
有什麼用嗎?
What good is that gonna do?

613
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,100
完全隨你
It's your call.

614
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,300
這是那種 催眠之類的東西嗎?
Is this, you know, like hypnosis or something?

615
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,700
不 我只是想領你過一遍那晚的事情
No. I'm just gonna try and trigger some memories

616
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,400
試著喚回一些記憶
By walking you through what happened that night.

617
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,700
好吧
All right.

618
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,300
我應該 呃...閉上眼嗎 還是...?
Should I, uh, close my eyes or...

619
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,700
可以 我只是想讓你盡可能放鬆
If you want. I just want you to try and relax.

620
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
好的
Ok.

621
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,300
開始了
Here we go.

622
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,400
是七月
It was July.

623
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,900
氣候炎熱
And it was hot.

624
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,100
窗戶開著呢嗎?
Were the windows open?

625
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,600
嗯
Yeah.

626
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,200
還有 呃 有一陣小風
And, uh, there was a breeze.

627
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,800
嗯 很好 繼續
Good. Good. That's really good.

628
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,200
你能聽到什麼?
What do you hear?

629
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,900
呃 什麼都聽不到
Uh, nothing.

630
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,800
你確定嗎?
Are you sure?

631
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
嗯 我爺爺把我叫起來
Yeah. Yeah, my grandfather woke me up

632
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,800
和我講發生了意外
And he told me about the accident.

633
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,000
慢點 慢點 和我一起來
Slow down. Slow down. Stay with me.

634
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,700
有一陣小風
There was a breeze.

635
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,800
你聞到什麼了?
What did you smell?

636
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,900
你認真的麼?
Seriously?

637
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,100
你試一下就是了
Just try.

638
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,700
好吧
Ok.

639
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,900
你聞到什麼了?
What did you smell?

640
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
我聞到了什麼...嗯...
What did I smell? Um...

641
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,200
我不知道 呃...
I don't know. Uh...

642
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,400
我聞到了海洋
I smelled the ocean.

643
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,700
我媽媽的香水
My mother's perfume.

644
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,300
Spicer 什麼?
Spicer. What?

645
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,900
煙?
Cigarettes?

646
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,200
好奇怪 我聞到了煙味
This is weird. I smell cigarettes.

647
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,500
你爺爺抽煙嗎?
Did your grandfather smoke?

648
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,600
從不抽
Never.

649
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,400
加油 再想想
Come on, think.

650
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
是誰?
Who was it?

651
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,300
你好呀
Hello there.

652
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,600
他說 "你好呀"
He said, "Hello there."

653
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,700
這是他留的第一條信息
That was his first message.

654
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,600
他在做什麼?
What's he doing?

655
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,700
他...他拽著我
He's...he's dragging me.

656
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,600
我聽到我妹妹在哭
I hear my baby sister crying.

657
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,100
我聽到我爸爸 他在吼叫
I hear my daddy. He's yelling.

658
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,900
你滾出去! 不許碰我 你個狗雜...
Get out of here! Don't you touch me, you son of a--

659
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,100
他殺了我爸爸
He killed my dad.

660
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,600
求求你別傷害我的孩子
Please don't hurt my babies.

661
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,800
我看不到他的臉
I can't see his face.

662
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
殺了我吧
Take me.

663
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,300
太黑了
It's too dark.

664
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,800
她在求他
She's begging him.

665
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,600
求求你別傷害他們
Please don't hurt them.

666
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,300
我...
I can't--

667
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,300
我看不到他...我死活...
I couldn't see, man. I just--

668
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,000
對不起 我做不到
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

669
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,400
沒關係的 嘿
Ok. Hey. sorry

670
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,700
不 這就夠了 對不起
No, that's enough.

671
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,600
你已經做得很好了
You did enough.

672
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,500
很好的
You're good.

673
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,700
好的 完事了嗎?
Ok. We cool?

674
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,100
他幹嘛要這麼做?
Ok, why is he doing this?

675
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,500
他每次都會留一個倖存者  好讓他們永遠都不會忘記
He keeps a survivor so that they'll never forget him,

676
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,700
但至於你 則有更深一層的含義 因為...
But with you, it goes beyond that, because--

677
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,000
因為他認為是他把你變成了這座城市的英雄
He believes he turned you into the city's hero.

678
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,300
如果你的家長沒有被害
If your parents weren't killed,

679
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,100
也許你就不會成為警探
You might not have become a Detective.

680
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,000
是 但他是怎麼知道的呢?
Yeah, but how would he know that?

681
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,900
他又沒留在洛杉磯
It's not like he stayed in L.A.

682
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,000
他跑遍了整個國家
He's been all over the country.

683
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,000
媒體談論過你的過去
The press has talked about your history.

684
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,400
他沒有被包括在內
He's not a part of it.

685
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
而他想要得到這個認可
And he wants that recognition.

686
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,600
他想讓所有人都知道他對你做過什麼
He wants everyone to know what he's done to you.

687
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,900
他要怎麼做到呢?
How's he gonna do that?

688
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
那是你女兒嗎?
Is that your daughter?

689
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
她在哪兒呢?
Where is she?

690
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,800
他和我妹妹在我家
She's with my sister at my house.

691
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,000
Kristin? Ellie?
Kristin? Ellie?

692
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,800
Ellie?
Ellie?

693
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,500
(Matt Spicer警探 一個護衛英雄的故事)
[DETECTIVE MATT SPICER -a view of the man behind the shield]

694
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,700
隨著水星宮的上升 我們的能量需求也會上升
As the Mercury soars, so do our power needs.

695
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,100
洛杉磯水電局提醒大家電量已經
L.A. DWP is warning that critical power levels

696
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,000
達到危險臨界 請大家盡可能少量
are being reached and asks that you keep your acus

697
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,200
使用電力 好保持整個城市的電力供給
To a minimum so we can keep the lights on in the city.

698
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,800
Ellie不見了 他妹妹也不見了
Ellie's gone. So is his sister.

699
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,300
他們是在去警局的路上嗎?
Are they on their way to the station?

700
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,100
車還在那 而且電力也被切斷了
The car's still here and the power's cut,

701
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,400
所以不明嫌犯肯定已經去過了
So the unsub was definitely here.

702
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,200
你要去哪兒?
Where are you going?

703
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,700
我們得去他妹妹家看看
We're gonna try his sister's place.

704
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,100
這傢伙喜歡隱私權
This guy needs privacy.

705
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
他沒有把她們留在那媗我們看
He didn't leave them here for us to find,

706
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,100
也就意味著他把她們帶到了某處
Which means he took them somewhere.

707
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,200
她的地址是哪?
What's her address?

708
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,900
謝媢y街 1720號
1720 Sheridan.

709
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,800
- 好的 我們在那兒見 - 好的
Ok, we'll meet you there. Ok, good. 

710
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,500
我都不知道我們能否在那塈鋮鴠L
I don't even know if we're gonna find him there.

711
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,600
- 你知道麼? 我們不會的 - 什麼? 
You know what? We won't. What? 

712
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,200
他針對的是你 與你妹妹家毫無瓜葛
This is about you. There's no history at your sister's place.

713
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,800
他也許是把她們帶到了你在聖莫尼卡的老家
He probably took them to Santa Monica to your old house.

714
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,100
Reid 我們這埵b堵車 交通燈全壞了
Reid, we're stuck in traffic. The lights are out.

715
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,300
嗯 這堛漱]壞了
Yeah, it's out here, too.

716
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,300
發電機超負荷了 應該是全城範圍的
Working off generators. Pretty sure it's citywide.

717
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,500
Morgan在另外一條線上
That's Morgan on the other line.

718
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,900
我們要去Kristin家和他碰面
We're gonna meet him at Kristin's house.

719
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
咱們快去吧
Let's get over there.

725
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,100
Spicer 咱們真的應該等後援來了再說
Spicer, we really should be waiting for backup.

726
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,300
沒時間了 那邊有個後門 我去看看
We don't have time. There's a door around back. I'll check that.

727
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
他在哪兒呢?
Where is he?

728
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,900
殺了我吧 殺了我吧
Take me. Take me.

別讓他傷害我
Don't let him hurt me.

737
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,400
Spicer 別這麼做 他不殺孩子的 你知道的
Spicer, don't do it. He doesn't kill children. You know that.

738
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,200
他不殺孩子的 你知道的
He doesn't kill children. You know that.

739
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,800
你敢冒這個險麼?
You sure about that?

740
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,500
你放下就是了 Matt
Just put it down, Matt.

741

把槍放下 不然她的小命就難保了
Put the gun down or she dies.

742

別向他屈服
Don't give in to him, man.

743
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,500
只要你不屈服 他就不會傷害你
He's not gonna hurt you unless you surrender.

744
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,500

I can't--I can't breathe. Breathe, breathe.

747

你妹妹長大了很漂亮嘛
Your sister grew up real pretty.

761

上次我見到她的時候 她還是個小不點兒呢
Last time I saw her, she was just an itty-bitty thing.

762
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,400
還是沒你媽漂亮喲
Not as good as your mom, though.

763
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,900
她老扭來扭去的
She squirms too much.

764
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,900
去死吧!
Go to hell.

一般來講我不是很喜歡小孩子
I don't usually take much to kids.

790
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,900
