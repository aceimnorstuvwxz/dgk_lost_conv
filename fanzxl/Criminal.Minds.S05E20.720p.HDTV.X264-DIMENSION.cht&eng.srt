68
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,860
我沒啥安排
I didn't have any plans.

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,280
嘿 這是我剛收到的傳真
Hey,uh,these were just faxed to me.

70
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,470
我同塔拉哈西 負責失蹤女學生案子的警探談過
I talked to a tallahassee detective who's been working a missing coed--

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Rebecca Daniels 3周前在 佛羅里達州立大學附近慢跑時失蹤
rebecca daniels-- she went missing while jogging near the fsu campus 3 weeks ago.

72
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,450
他是誰?
Who's this?

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,360
佛羅里達州警1個半小時前 接到的自殺案
Florida state police responded to an apparent suicide an hour and a half ago.

74
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,180
中年男子 這些是他死後拍下的照片
Middle-aged male. Those are photos of him postmortem.

75
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,350
紋身是怎麼回事?
What's with the tattoos?

76
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,910
是的 他身上都是 幾乎紋滿全身
Yeah,he's covered in them, almost completely.

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,080
因為這個 他們想請我們出馬
That's why they requested our presence.

78
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,840
紋身圖案是之前失蹤的女性
The tattoos are portraits of previously missing women,

79
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,590
有多年前遇害的 有後來發現遺骸的
with the years of death or the years the remains were recovered,anyway.

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,280
紋身和屍體旁邊牆壁上貼的人物對應
The tattoos correlate to faces on a wall next to the body,

81
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,370
附有她們的信息  最早可追溯到10年前
with information on the women going back 10 years.

82
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,290
Rebecca的資料也貼在牆上 但沒有紋在屍體上
Rebecca is also shown on that wall, but there's no image of her on the body.

83
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,060
警探們認為 也許她還活著
The detective thinks that that may mean that she's alive somewhere.

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,780
- 他打電話報警自殺的對吧?  - 是的 你怎麼...
- He called in his own suicide,didn't he? - Yeah.How did you--

85
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,580
他自導自演的
he staged all this.

86
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,230
沒理由演一齣沒人看的戲
No reason to put on a show without an audience.

87
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,680
叫他們不要動屍體
Tell them to leave the body where it is.

88
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,090
我們得看看 他想展示什麼給大家看
We need to see it exactly how he wanted it seen.

89
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,050
如果這女孩還活著  唯一知道她藏身之處的人可能已經死了
If this girl's still out there, the only one who knows where she is may be dead.

You know,it isn't so much the heat as it is the humidity.

95
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,350

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,710
大多數連環殺手會在被抓後 在監獄自殺
Most serial killers who commit suicide do it in prison after they're caught.

129
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,260
JJ 盡可能收集之前的受害者的資料
Jj,gather as much information about the prior victims as you can.

130
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,100
Morgan和Prentiss 分析日記
Morgan and prentiss, take the journals.

131
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,410
Dave 你跟Reid研究紋身 看能否發現Daniels藏身地的線索
Dave,you and reid, the tattoos. See if he left any clues about where miss daniels might be.

132
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,890
你覺得她可能還活著嗎?
You think there's a chance she might still be alive?

133
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,530
還是別猜測為好
It's probably better not to speculate.

134
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,620
我能看下關於Daniels的失蹤案檔嗎?
May i take a look at the case files you have on miss daniels?

135
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,230
可以 當然 沒問題
Yeah,yeah,no problem.

136
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,300
他一邊跟接線員說話 突然就開了槍
He was on the phone with dispatch and then, boom.

137
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,250
這有多高 15英尺 (4.5米)?
Must be what,15 feet?

138
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,630
完美的謝幕啊
Consummate overachiever.

139
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,030
對 是的
Right. Right.

140
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,700
為何男人自殺時會把血濺得到處都是?
Why is it when men kill themselves, itets everywhere,

141
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,230
而女人從來不會搞成如此?
but women don't leave a mess, like they were never there?

142
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,760
女人比較擔心清掃的問題 男人則無所顧忌
Women worry about who has to clean up. Men don't give a damn.

143
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,640
JJ 有發現嗎?
Jj,what have you found?

144
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,340
最早的剪報是10年前的 按時間順序排列 直到最近
The earliest clipping is from 10 years ago, and they're in order, oldest to newest.

145
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,630
Brenda Carlyle是第一個 Rebecca Daniels是最後一個
Brenda carlyle first, rebecca daniels last.

146
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,120
行為縝密
That was thoughtful of him.

147
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,000
10年以來每年都有一名受害者
One victim a year for 10 years straight.

148
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,730
每個女孩的遺體 都會在旅客常去的林區被發現
Each girl's remains were recovered in a well-traveled wooded area.

149
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,000
勒死 多次性侵犯 然後大約一周後 另一名女子失蹤
Strangled,repeatedly sexually assaulted, and then about a week later, another woman goes missing.

150
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,020
有沒有綁架事件發生在 屍體發現之前的?
Did the new abductions happen before the previous body's been found?

151
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,640
- 沒 從來沒有 - 所以他的作案週期是一年
- No,never. - So he has a year-long cycle.

152
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,110
他玩膩了她們 然後再換個新的
He uses them up and he gets a newer model.

153
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,540
但直到前一個女孩的屍體被發現前 他不會掠走新的女孩
But he won't take another girl until the last body's been found.

154
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,890
他像是在講故事  想說個新的 就必須把老的講完
He's telling a story and he can't start a new one until the old one's over.

155
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,940
看這個 在16世紀末17世紀初期
Look at that.At the turn of the 16th century,

156
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,120
被處死刑的男囚會被紋上玫瑰紋身
rose tattoos were put on men who were sentenced to death.

157
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,640
- 真的嗎? - 是 如果他們越獄 就可以據此識別
- Really? - Yeah. If they escaped, it served to identify them.

158
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,640
但現在玫瑰象徵著純潔的愛
But now roses pretty much symbolize pure love.

159
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,060
純潔的愛 直到動手殺死她們
Pure love. Right before he kills them.

160
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,230
- 嘿 讀過"圖案人"嗎? (著名科幻小說) - 沒
- Hey,have you read "the illustrated man"? - Nope.

161
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,850
很棒的 是雷·布萊伯利 (科幻大師) 值得收藏的短篇小說
Oh,it's amazing. It's a collection of short stories by ray bradbury,

162
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,480
講述一名全身覆蓋著紋身的男子 而紋身是由未來的女人設計的
based on the metafictive device of a man who's covered in tattoos drawn by a woman from the future.

163
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,740
每到晚上紋身圖案就會復活 並講述一段故事 真的很贊
At nighttime, the tattoos come to life and tell a story. It's pretty awesome.

164
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,150
這些確實是在講述故事
These do tell a story.

165
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,640
你一定還想看這個
Oh,you want to see something?

166
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,960
紋身樹中的一處空白
A space in the tree.

167
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,750
這個旁邊沒有日期
And there's no date on that one.

168
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,610
他為何要留著這處空白?
Why would he leave that space blank?

169
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,810
也許這傢伙只是個神經病
Maybe this guy's just a psycho.

170
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,130
真這麼簡單 那我們就失業了
If it were that simple, we'd all be out of a job.

171
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,790
Reid
Hey,reid.

172
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,560
怎麼了?
What's up?

173
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,880
這傢伙留下的日記還挺長
Our man here was a prolific journaler.

174
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,310
而且字跡密密麻麻
With teeny tiny handwriting.

175
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,550
他可能在接受某些心理輔導 日記是療法的一部分
He probably had counseling at some point when journaling was part of his therapy.

176
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,400
我們也這麼想
That's what we were thinking.

177
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,130
直說吧?
And?

178
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,390
你知道 我們兩個人就是讀三天也讀不完
And,uh, well,you know, the two of us, it would take us like 3 days to read all of this stuff.

179
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,670
你們欠我一次
You guys owe me.

180
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,380
難怪沒有人把這些案件聯繫起來
It's no wonder no one has ever connected these cases.

181
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,330
死者來自不同的州 隸屬不同的司法管轄區
They're from different states, different jurisdictions.

182
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,050
這絕非偶然 他非常瞭解司法系統
It's probably no accident. He knows the system.

183
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,260
那現在為何自殺? 根本沒人追查到他
Why kill himself now? He wasn't on anyone's radar.

184
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,330
一定有什麼發生了轉變 讓大家集合
Something changed. Let's gather everyone.

185
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,190
到目前為止我們都有什麼線索?
So what do we know so far?

186
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,650
他希望警方發現這 也希望我們能夠看到這一切
He wanted the police here. He wanted us to see all this.

187
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,320
他絕對是一個虐待狂 我們發現他的日記有中詳細圖畫
He was definitely a sadist. From what we saw, his journals were graphic and meticulous.

188
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,110
用受害者肖像覆滿全身 顯示出他很有條理 很有佔有慾
Covering himself with his victims' likeness is methodical,possessive.

189
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,810
他將永遠擁有她們
He'll always own them.

190
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,950
自殺更像是一種承諾
And the suicide shows commitment.

191
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,180
他非常有組織 有強迫性 作案週期為一年
He's organized and compulsive. The crimes are on an annual cycle.

192
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,230
板上的打印資料 都是在2周前的同一天被打印出的
Computer printouts on the board, they were all printed on the same day-- 2 weeks ago.

193
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,570
他那個時候租用了這個建築
That's when he rented this building.

194
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,310
然後把所有東西都陳列其中 他的犯罪歷史
And proceeded to move everything into it. It's a history of his crimes.

195
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,600
他在兩周內安排了這一切
So he did all of this in 2 weeks.

196
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,390
作案十年 無人追查他 本可繼續隱身的
He got away with it for 10 years. He could have kept going.

197
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,100
但他決定結束這一切 並全部呈現給我們
But he decides to end it all and hand everything to us.

198
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,100
- 就是這樣 所有一切 - Reid?
- That's it--everything.Everything. - Reid?

199
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,040
所有的一切 他的身體 紋身 剪報 打印資料和日記
Everything. His body, the tattoos,the clippings, the printout,the journals.

200
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,040
他把所有東西都搬到這個房間 他希望我們看到這一切
He moved it all into one room. He wanted us to see all of it.

201
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,690
看到他的一切 他的傑作  按時間排列的那些受害女人
See all of him-- his work--the women,he put them in chronological order.

202
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,460
- 他像在炫耀 "看我牛不" - 我們明白這點
- He's screaming,"look at me." - We all got that.

203
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,900
不 仔細想想 退一步想 似乎有道理啊
No,but think about it. If you take a step back, it sort of makes sense.

204
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,160
不過是一份供詞 一份誇張的供詞
It's just a confession. A giant,flashy confession.

205
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,610
警方都沒有察覺呢 不明嫌犯為何要自首?
What would we say if an unsub turned himself in to the police before they were even onto him?

206
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,050
- 他想掩蓋什麼東西 - 或者什麼人
- That he was trying to hide something. - Or someone.

207
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,640
他在第三本書中犯了一個錯誤 我差點忽略 但後來發現了它
He made a mistake-- in his third book. I almost missed it, but then i caught it.

208
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,690
"我本以為需要更久 但今天是個幸運日"
"I thought it would take longer, "but today was the lucky day.

209
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,570
"她正好經過... 幾乎錯過了她"
"She almost walked right by, "almost missed her completely,

210
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,260
"但在最後時刻 我們找到了我們的新客人"
"but at the last moment, we found our latest guest."

211
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,830
- "我們" - 他還有個搭檔
- We. - He has a partner.

212
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,760
他把一切都展示在這 好讓我們不再繼續查案 挖掘更深
He put everything in this room so we wouldn't look further, wouldn't dig even deeper.

213
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,280
如果他有搭檔 那他仍然隱匿在外 並且抓了Rebecca Daniels
If he has a partner, he's still out there, and he's got rebecca daniels.

214
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,900
對不起 很抱歉
Oh,i'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

215
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,450
我大聲喊過 但我想你的音樂太大聲
I was calling out, but i guess your music was too loud.

216
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,900
- 你沒事吧? - 我沒事 很好
- Are you all right? - I'm fine. It's all right.

217
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,110
- Juliet Monroe? - 是我
- Juliet monroe? - That's me.

218
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,430
這是你的 請簽名
That's for you. If i can get you to sign here.

219
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,110
- 非常感謝 不好意思 - 沒事
- Thank you very much. Sorry about that. - It's fine.

220
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,600
- 祝你愉快 - 你也是
- Have a great day,now. - You,too.

221
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,390
夫人
Ma'am.

222
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,730
我的至愛 當你讀到這封信時 我已經不在了
My dearest love, by the time you read this, i will have gone.

223
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,410
你帶給我如此幸福的人生 像我這樣的男人 是從未奢望過的
Our life together has brought me more joy than a man like me thought he could ever know.

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,770
我本想帶著你跟我一起走
My first wish would be to take you with me,

225
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,470
但我知道你已經做好準備 展開人生新的篇章
but since you are in our home readying yourself with the next chapter of our life--

226
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,150
養育我們可愛的寶寶
to care for and raise our beautiful child,

227
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,240
我別無所求 只希望你能完成我們共同的使命
my last hope is that you finish what we started.

228
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,910
求你 求求你
Please. Please.

229
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,270
讓我回家吧
Just let me go home.

230
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,130
這是你的錯
This is your fault.

231
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,910
這全是你的錯
This is your fault.

232
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,100
求你了
Please.

233
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,690
她在那邊幹什麼?
What's she doing down there?

234
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,410
跟媒體溝通 讓他們別馬上報道這件事
She's trying to keep the media from running the story right now.

235
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,130
媒體報道對我們應該有利呀? 能給他的搭檔施加壓力
But wouldn't that help us get it out there, put some pressure on the partner?

236
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,860
如果搭檔不知道他自殺了 或許會因為失去Daniel而離開
But if the partner didn't know about the suicide, he might dispose of miss daniels and disappear.

237
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,630
只有JJ能說服媒體停止報道
If anyone can stop the media from running something,it's jj.

238
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,180
我們側寫一下這個搭檔吧
So let's profile the partner.

239
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,430
我們知道 不明嫌犯具有支配性人格 是主導者
We know that the unsub was a dominant personality, an alpha.

240
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,980
在一起案件中 主犯為了保護從犯而自殺
Can any of you guys think of a case where a dominant unsub committed suicide

241
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,860
- 大家遇到過相同的情況嗎? - 沒有
- to protect a submissive partner? - No.

242
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,660
所以從犯一定在某些方面和主犯是平等的 至少他們彼此不是敵手
So the partner must be an equal in some way, or at least not a competitor,

243
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,030
他不需要在這個人身上實現自己的統治欲
not somebody that he needed to feel dominance over.

244
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,720
或許是一個他在乎的人?
Maybe it was someone he cared about?

245
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,440
對一個殘酷成性的精神病來說 很難去在乎什麼人
It would be hard for a sadistic psychopath to care about anybody.

246
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,510
正是因此 這個同夥對他才那麼重要
Which would make the partner all that much more important to him.

247
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,570
那些畫紋身的呢? 他不可能自己紋上去
What about the tattoo artist? He couldn't have done those by himself.

248
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,150
- 或許同夥就是扮演這個角色 - 畫紋身當然重要了
- Maybe that's the role for the partner. - It would certainly make him important.

249
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,270
這些跟Becky究竟有什麼關係?
What the hell does any of this have to do with becky?

250
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,810
我們不該採取些行動嗎? 該死
I mean,isn't there something we should be doing,damn it?

251
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,010
警探 借一步說話
Detective,may i speak with you for a moment?

252
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,660
我們可以撐到6點的晚間新聞
So we have until the evening news--6 P.M.

253
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,110
他們知道多少?
How much do they know?

254
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,130
那些警察把所有事情都說了
Oh,the troopers told them everything.

255
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,560
Rossi探員 你打電話來 是為了告訴我案子已經解決了嗎?
Agent rossi, please tell me you called because the case is over

256
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,170
我就可以把這些噁心的圖片 從我的超美桌面上清除了
and i can erase this freakity-freak off my otherwise uber-delicious desktops.

257
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,690
離破案還早著呢 孩子
Long way to go,kid.

258
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,980
我對表皮藝術的變態行為 見識也不少了 但是這傢伙...
I am into epidermartistry as much as the next gen xer, but this guy.

259
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,750
很慶幸你們不用跟他呼吸一樣的空氣了 我親愛的朋友
Eesh, i'm just glad he's not breathing the same air as you, my fine furry friends.

260
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,060
是啊 刺青師有什麼發現嗎?
Agreed. What have you found out about tattoo artists down here?

261
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,470
佛州的刺青師都需要有上崗執照
That the state of florida requires licensing for all skin illustrators,

262
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,290
但是...我就不詳細說我是怎麼知道的了...
but--and i am not going to elaborate on how i know this--

263
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,120
並不是所有人都經過了官方認可
not everyone in the body art lifestyle goes through official channels.

264
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,350
我們就先從有執照的開始 看有沒有人能認出這是誰的作品
All right,we'll start with the legit ones and see if anyone recognizes the work.

265
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,800
- 我會把清單發到你的PDA上 - 謝了
- I shall send the list to your pda. - Thanks.

266
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,170
表皮藝術?
Epidermartistry?

267
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,630
只有一個女孩 能填滿那股能量...
Only a girl can fill that empty energy.

268
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,870
抱歉我話說得難聽 只是太累了
Look,i'm sorry i popped off. I'm just a little worked up.

269
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,450
我看了Rebecca Daniels的卷宗 是你的報告
I've been over the rebecca daniels case file,your reports.

270
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,180
- 你認識她嗎? - 什麼?
- Do you know her? - What?

271
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,760
你們有什麼私人關係嗎?
Is there a personal relationship?

272
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,310
你到底想說什麼?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

273
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,090
你兩次叫她"Becky"
You've referred to her twice as becky.

274
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,090
是嗎?
I did?

275
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
別處報告都不會這麼叫 都稱她"Rebecca"
And nowhere else is she referred to that way. It's always rebecca.

276
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,570
如果有什麼事會阻礙你的判斷 你必須告訴我
Now,if there's something that's gonna cloud your judgment, i need to know about it.

277
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,490
不 我不認識她
No. I don't know her.

278
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,180
那是怎麼回事?
Then what is it?

279
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,550
聽著 我...我幹這一行已經很長時間了
Look,i've... I've been doing this a long time,and...

280
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,600
整天面對這些事情 人們互相殘殺 一起墮落 你明白嗎?
It usually just washes right over me,you know, people killing people, depravity,you know?

281
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,060
晚上一個人在家 就會想起來
As long as you make it home at night,right?

282
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,720
但是這個人...她的父母...
But this one... Her parents...

283
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,090
他們都是很善良很體面的人
They're just such good, decent people.

284
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,480
她是一個好女孩 而且...
She seems like an amazing girl,and...

285
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,100
沒什麼了
It's all.

286
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,120
有時候就是難以承受
Sometimes it's just too much.

287
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,960
會摻雜私人感情在堶
You take it personal.

288
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,490
很愚蠢 是吧?
Stupid,right?

289
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:48,200
如果你是不計後果地去關心他們 那才叫愚蠢
Caring about a victim, personalizing them, can only be stupid if it's reckless.

290
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,300
沒擔心我了 我沒事的
Don't worry about me. I'm good.

291
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,850
那就好 走吧 但願能送她回家
All right. Let's go and try to bring her home.

292
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,720
外面都快40度了吧 可和倉庫比起來 還是跟冰櫃似的
It's like 110 out here and it feels like a refrigerator compared to their warehouse.

293
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,710
Reid看得怎麼樣了?
How's reid doing?

294
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,100
高溫根本不足以困擾他
It doesn't even seem to faze him.

295
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,350
他就待在角落 翻看日記
He's just sitting there in a corner turning pages.

296
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,740
是啊 他閱讀的時候 心就鑽到堶悼h了
Yeah,he goes to another place when he reads.

297
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,230
我拿到了塔拉哈西大部分刺青館的地址
I've got the addresses of the major tattoo parlors in tallahassee.

298
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,970
那幅作品刺得非常仔細啊 說不定有人會認出來
That work is pretty detailed. Someone might recognize it.

299
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,930
你要和我一起去確認嗎?
You want to go check these out with me?

300
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,900
好啊
Sounds fun.

301
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,210
媒體那邊又爭取到了幾小時
Hey,so,uh,i got a few more hours out of the media.

302
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,410
有什麼線索就查什麼
Well,we'll take what we can get.

303
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,510
Prentiss和Rossi去調查刺青館了
Prentiss and rossi are going to check out some tattoo parlors.

304
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,160
- 他還好嗎? - 還好
- Is he ok? - Yeah.

305
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,650
你問過他為什麼叫她Becky了嗎?
Did you ask him about calling her becky?

306
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,760
- 他會沒事的 - 希望如此
- He'll be all right. - Well,i hope so.

307
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,580
現在根本沒有那姑娘是否還活著的線索
Because we still have no indication that this girl's even alive.

308
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,570
我沒法完成所有的事
I wasn't able to tie up all the loose ends.

309
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,010
你應該知道發生了什麼
You would have known what was happening.

310
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,070
所以 該由你來善後了
So now it's left for you.

311
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,820
等到晚上 將它帶到水邊
Wait for night and take it to the water.

312
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,970
剩下的 就讓動物去做吧
The animals will do the rest.

313
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,760
是他殺了這些女人?
This guy killed all those women?

314
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,310
看起來是這樣 現在還有一個女人失蹤
Looks like it. And there's another one missing.

315
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,070
然後他自殺了?
Then he killed himself?

316
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,290
- 是啊 - 不錯 也算是一種公共服務吧
- Yeah,he did. - Good. Sort of a public service.

317
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,420
也許這樣想 大家都會好過一點
I guess that's a good way of looking at it.

318
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,860
我們把屍體遞交塔拉哈西的殮房 你簽字嗎?
We send it to the M.E. 'S office in tallahassee. You sign it?

319
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,370
- 我晚點再處理這事 謝謝 - 多謝
- I'll take care of that,later. Thanks. - Thanks a lot.

320
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,660
你確定可以挪屍體了?
You sure it's ok to move the body?

321
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,150
嗯 沒理由不挪啊  這傢伙的表演我們已經看了
Well,there's no reason not to anymore. We've seen this guy's show.

322
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,880
你以前見過像這樣的事情嗎?
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

323
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,390
- 像哪樣? - 一切
- Like what? - Everything.

324
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,800
呃...自殺 剪報 日記...
The,uh,suicide, the clippings, the journal.

325
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,120
我想 應該可以說  沒人曾見過這樣的事情
I think it's pretty safe to say that no one's ever seen anything like this.

326
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,800
夥計 這活幹得可真漂亮
Man,this is beautiful work.

327
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,670
紋一身衣服唄? 他紋全了嗎?
It's a body suit? He's completely covered?

328
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,630
- 差不多吧 - 沒錯
- Pretty much. - Yeah.

329
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,680
- "圖案人" - 今天我是第二次聽到這個了
- "the illustrated man." - Second time i've heard that today.

330
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,640
- 那本書? - Reid提到過
- The book? - Reid mentioned it.

331
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,310
在紋身行 那個故事可是人盡皆知啊
Everybody in the body art world knows that story.

332
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,690
這夥計自殺了?
You said this dude killed himself?

333
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,690
他...是割腕了還是怎麼的? 
Did he,like, gash his wrists open or something?

334
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,910
這紋身...你能認出是誰紋的嗎?
The tattoos--could you recognize who did this?

335
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,230
我倒想 我會立刻雇下他  這看上去像是徒手紋的
I wish. I'd hire this dude in a heartbeat. This looks free-hand.

336
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,820
相信我 徒手在皮膚上紋肖像 是相當難的 夥計
Trust me,free-hand portraiture is pretty gnarly to do on skin,man.

337
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,600
他是舉槍自盡的吧? 因為這些照片都沒有拍到頭
Did he shoot himself? Because none of these pictures have a head.

338
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,960
你能分辨出 這些是否 出自同一個紋身師之手?
Can you tell if the same artist did these?

339
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,420
看起來像是 但並不是在同一時間紋的
It looks like it. But they weren't all done at the same time.

340
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,310
有些墨跡比較新
Some of the inks are newer.

341
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,280
要是我看到屍體 也許能告訴你們更多信息
You know,if i saw the body, i'd probably be able to tell you more.

342
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,990
這些呢?
How about these?

343
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,500
肖像真不少呢 代表什麼意義嗎?
These are a lot of portraits. What do they mean?

344
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,420
這正是我們試圖要搞清楚的
That's what we're trying to figure out.

345
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,340
等等 這個不配套啊
Wait. That doesn't fit.

346
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,480
什麼不配套?
What doesn't?

347
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,640
這玫瑰下面有圖案
There's something under the rose there.

348
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,050
看著像...十字? 挺大一個
Looks like... A cross? A big one.

349
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,570
- 哪? - 在玫瑰堶
- Where? - Inside the rose.

350
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,240
這個就紋得很糙了 看到了嗎? 又在上面紋了玫瑰 來蓋住它
And the work is sloppy. See that? They put the rose over it to cover it up.

351
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,160
- 是啊 我看到了 - 沒錯 那個紋得可不專業
- Yeah,i see that. - Yeah,that wasn't done professionally.

352
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,080
更像是在監獄堹儐
More like it was done in jail.

353
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,820
要是他坐過牢 那就能解釋為什麼 50歲的不明疑犯 直到40才開始殺人
If he did time, that would explain how a 50-year-old unsub doesn't start killing until he's 40.

354
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,650
這夥計是個殺人犯?
This dude's a killer?

355
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,260
還有 為什麼服刑後 強姦犯會變成殺手
And why rapists become killers after they've been in prison.

356
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,030
他們學會了不留人證
They learn not to leave a witness.

357
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,610
Garcia可以用生物識別程序追蹤這個
Garcia can track this through the biometric recognition program.

358
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,450
我貌似是沒機會見 這位掛掉的老兄了吧?
So,there's,like,no chance of me seeing the dead dude,right?

359
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,290
別想了
None.

360
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,370
嘿P.G. 我待會兒會給你 發一張紋身的照片
Hey,p.G.,i'm gonna send you a photograph of a tattoo.

361
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,400
你知道嗎 他背後的空白處 讓他跟"圖案人"一模一樣
You know,that empty space on his back makes him exactly like "the illustrated man."

362
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,370
- 我以為圖案人是紋滿全身的 - 書上是這樣
- I thought he was covered completely. - In the book.

363
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,770
但在電影 他背上有一塊空白 你可以借此看到未來
In the movie, there's an open spot on his back, so you can see the future.

364
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,490
Rossi和Prentiss認為他可能曾服刑
Rossi and prentiss think he may have done time

365
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,200
- 某處紋身可能是在牢堹儐 - 這可能性挺大的
- and that one of the tattoos may have been done in prison. - That's a good bet.

366
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,640
我已經讓Garcia在生物識別數據庫 檢索所有的資料
I've got garcia running everything through the biometrics database.

367
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,590
生物識別?
Biometrics?

368
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,990
是 堶接n記了 所有囚犯和他們的紋身
Yeah,it catalogues all the prison inmates and their tattoos.

369
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,680
有每個囚犯的紋身細節圖
They have detailed photos of every one on every inmate.

370
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,910
- 出什麼事了? - 閉嘴
- What happened? - Shut up.

371
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,820
拜託 坐下 你可以告訴我啊
Please,sit down. You can tell me.

372
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,680
我們可以坐下來... 這事我們可以談談的 我們可以...
We can sit down and-- we can talk about this.We could--

373
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,270
等等! 拜託 我們能談談嗎? 求你了
wait! Please. Can we please talk?

374
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,980
我爸爸一定擔心死我了
My dad has to be so worried about me.

375
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,910
你就沒有爸爸嗎?
Don't you have a father?

376
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,510
- 我什麼人也沒有了 - 求你
- I don't have anyone anymore. - Please.

377
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,000
在他回來之前 就放我走吧
Just let me go before he comes back.

378
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,690
他不會回來了
He's not coming back.

379
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,920
什麼? 等等
What? Wait.

380
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,730
- 你可以放我走的 - 什麼?
- You can let me go. - What?

381
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,380
我...我不會告訴任何人發生了什麼的
It's just-- i won't tell anyone what happened.

382
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,750
我保證 我不會跟任何人說
I promise i won't tell anyone.

383
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,380
你不會跟任何人說?
You won't tell anyone?

384
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,010
我知道你也很怕他
i know you're afraid of him,too.

385
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,810
你不會跟任何人說 是因為 你根本不會活著離開這個房間
You're not going to tell anyone because you're never leaving this room alive.

386
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,760
對不起 真對不起
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

387
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,700
我從來都不害怕他 我愛他
I was never afraid of him. I loved him.

388
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:57,120
為他 我會做任何事 我為他做了一切
I would do anything, i did anything for him.

389
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,340
他是我的傑作
He was my masterpiece.

390
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,510
你流血了!
You're bleeding!

391
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,230
她會用她的生命來償還
She will pay with her life.

392
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,300
接待完這最後一位客人 就可以填滿藝術收藏堻怮嶊漯臟鴗F
Once i'm done with this newest guest, i'll be able to fill in the last space in my art collection.

393
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,170
最後的空位...最後的空位...  最後的空位...
The last space... Last space... Last space...

394
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,100
不不不 那不對 
No,no,no, that's not right.

395
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,660
- 嘿夥計們 那不是唯一空白的地方 - 你什麼意思?
- Hey,guys,it isn't the only blank space. - What do you mean?

396
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,630
- 他胸口 我們推測本該紋Rebecca的地方 - 怎麼了?
- The spot on his chest where we assumed Rebecca's portrait would go-- - yeah?

397
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,920
在日記  他談到填滿最後的空位
in the journal he talks about filling in the last space,

398
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,930
- 一旦填滿 藝術收藏便完整了 - 還有呢?
- how once he does that the artwork will be complete. - And?

399
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,080
那不是唯一空白的地方
It isn't the only blank space.

400
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,100
在他背上 那棵樹的中間 有一大塊空的地方
In his back,in the middle of that tree is a giant open spot.

401
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,870
既然不是填滿"最後的空位" 為何要說完成藝術品呢?
Why would he talk about completing the artwork when he hasn't?

402
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,680
- 我得再看看那具屍體 - 我跟你一起去
- I need to see the body again. - I'll go with you.

403
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,940
我打電話給驗屍官  告訴他你們馬上就到
I'll call the M.E. And let him know you're on your way.

404
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,740
Garcia?
Garcia?

405
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,170
我通過形態追蹤系統 檢索了被蓋的紋身
I ran the covered tattoo through the morpho tracking system.

406
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,510
告訴我有成果啊 寶貝兒
Tell me you got something,babe.

407
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,530
Emily 我正要說呢 別搶我詞
Emily,don't get ahead of my dramatic telling.

408
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,030
我分析了顏色 設計 還有質地
I analyzed color,design, and texture.

409
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,490
它有95%的可能 出自東北部的四家主要監獄之一
There's a 95% chance it is from one of 4 major institutions in the northeastern prison system.

410
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,400
一系列失蹤案是從2000年開始 從未間斷 於是我追溯到那一年
The string of missings began unbroken from 2000, so i went back from that year,

411
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,480
找到個53人有類似的前臂紋身
found 53 similar tattoos on forearms.

412
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,660
其中 有10人於2000年之前出獄 謝謝 晚安
Of those 53,10 were released prior to 2000. Thank you and good night.

413
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,410
你太棒了
You are amazing.

414
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,290
這十個埵 有定了罪的強姦犯嗎?
Of the 10, any convicted rapists?

415
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,780
4個
4.

416
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,050
他們中有人可以追溯到塔拉哈西嗎?
Do any of them trace back to tallahassee?

417
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,710
沒有
None.

418
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,020
- 於是最終我還是一無所獲 - Bob
- So ultimately i have nada. - Bob.

419
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,030
哦 那傢伙 那個租房子的傢伙 他的名字...叫Bob...
Oh,the guy,his name, the guy who rented the property, just bob.

420
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,590
好的好的 我這埵陪 Robert Matthew Burke 1991年定罪
Ok,ok.I have a robert matthew burke, convicted in 1991,

421
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,770
因強姦入獄8年 1999年10月獲釋
8 years for rape, released october of '99.

422
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,210
而那些失蹤案是從2000年開始的
And the missings began in 2000.

423
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,170
Garcia 提醒我 永遠別費勁兒躲你
Garcia,remind me never to try to hide from you.

424
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,950
就死了這條心吧 我的朋友
Perish the thought,mon ami.

425
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,690
Hotch 我們查到名字了
Hotch,we got the name.

426
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,710
- 不明嫌犯叫Robert Matthew Burke - Burke?
- The unsub's name is robert matthew burke. - Burke?

427
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,520
你認識他?
You know him?

428
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,260
Burke 是啊 我認得這個名字 該死的!
Burke. Yeah. I know the name. Damn it!

429
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,610
他是登記在案的性犯罪者 在弗吉尼亞還有前科
He's a registered sex offender. He's an ex-con out of virginia.

430
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,390
Rebecca不見的那晚 他在州立大學附近 吃了一張交通罰單 他是我的疑犯之一 
He got a traffic ticket near fsu the night rebecca disappeared. He's one of my suspects.

431
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,520
過去三周 我去過好幾次他的公寓  一直試圖詢問他
I--i went to his apartment, i don't know,a couple times in the past 3 weeks to try to interview him,

432
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,920
但都沒能見到他
but i could never catch up with him.

433
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,290
他知道你在找他嗎?
Did he know you were looking for him?

434
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,390
是啊 我跟他通過電話
Well,yeah,i talked to him on the phone.

435
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,610
他約好週一來這堥訪並提供DNA採樣
He's scheduled to come down for an interview and a dna swab on monday.

436
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,240
這就是變化的地方 他知道被抓只是時間問題
That's what changed. He knew it was only a matter of time before you caught up to him.

437
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,970
而他絕不要再回監獄了
And he wasn't about to go back to prison.

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,070
- 你有他的住址嗎? - 有的
- Do you have his address? - Yeah.

439
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,710
哦 我的上帝! 哦 我的上帝! 
Oh,my god! Oh,my god!

440
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,030
出問題了 出問題了 
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

441
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,170
卸掉我的鏈子
Unchain me.

442
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,040
卸掉我的鏈子 我會幫你的
Unchain me and i will help you.

443
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,440
我不傻
I am not stupid.

444
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,210
你的寶寶需要幫助
Your baby needs help.

445
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,780
等等! 你不能...這項圈....
Wait! You can't-- the collar.

446
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,290
你幫我...然後我會放你走的
You help me and i'll let you go.

447
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,850
好的 好的 好的
Ok. Ok. Ok.

448
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,100
FBI!
Fbi!

449
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,160
該死
Damn it.

450
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,530
如果這些紋身是某種迷戀 他能從背後的紋身得到什麼享受?
If these tattoos are a fetish, what enjoyment does he get out of the ones on his back?

451
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,120
他連看都看不到它們
He can't even see them.

452
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,060
你知道嗎? 這埵麻I兒東西 我能摸出來墨跡的凸起
You know what? There's something here. I can feel the raised ink.

453
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,340
你有紫光燈掃瞄儀嗎? 謝了
Do you have a black light scanner? Thanks.

454
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,920
就在那 摸摸看
Right there. Feel that.

455
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,430
- 是啊 那是什麼? - 謝了
- Yeah,what is that? - Thanks.

456
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,910
我在書上看過 用隱形墨水刺青 這樣就沒人能看見了
I've read about this. Tattoos put on with invisible ink so that no one can see them.

457
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,540
哦 天啊
Oh,man.

458
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,090
你能...把燈關了嗎? 謝了
Can you,uh,turn the lights down? Thanks.

459
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,300
瞧 那兒也有
Look,there's one over here,too.

460
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,340
它們都連接到臉上
They're all connected to the faces.

461
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,840
- 最後通向那塊留白 - 那是什麼?
- They lead to the blank spot. - What is that?

462
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,650
是子宮堛滬L兒
It's an embryo in a womb.

463
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,970
共犯是個女人 懷了他們的孩子
The partner's a woman, and they're having a baby.

464
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,460
天吶!
Oh,my god!

465
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,810
好多血 我在幹什麼啊
There's more blood. I don't know what i'm doing.

466
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:52,570
止不住啊 我該怎麼辦! 還在流
It won't stop. It won't stop. I don't know what to do! It won't stop.I don't--

467
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,450
幫我
help me.

468
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,160
她有沒有生產?
Do we know if she had the baby yet?

469
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,220
他的紋身都標了日期 那個胎兒沒有
The tattoos have dates, the embryo doesn't.

470
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,610
在紋身和日記堣暾螺ㄚ頇藆X 記載了綁架的日期
Dating is prominent in the tattoos and the journals and they're calendrical in their abductions.

471
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,950
寶寶的生日肯定也非常重要
It's hard to believe their baby's birthdate wouldn't be exceedingly important to them.

472
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,540
所以她可能還沒生
Then she's probably still pregnant.

473
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,700
他沒和孕婦一起住在這兒 這是只有男性居住的單人間
Well,he didn't live here with a pregnant woman. This is a males-only sro.

474
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,360
反正她肯定有別的地方住
No,she has to have a house,anyway.

475
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,570
你們怎麼知道的?
How do you know that?

476
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,510
每個受害人都被他們關了一年 不可能是在單間公寓
They kept these women for a year each. It wasn't in a one-room apartment.

477
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,080
大家都回來 我們要更新側寫 縮小搜查範圍
Everyone get back here. We need to update the profile and narrow the search.

478
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,910
用力 用力啊!
Push. Push. Push! Push!

479
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,360
差不多了 繼續使勁
It's almost-- it's almost there. Just keep pushing.

480
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,960
- 我不行了 - 看見頭了!
- I can't. - I see the head!

481
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,620
再來一次 好了!
One more time, that's it!

482
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,700
- 請... 告訴我是個女孩 - 什麼?
- Please... Tell me it's a girl. - What?

483
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,440
千萬別是男孩
It can't be a boy. Please.

484
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,730
你生了兒子
you have a son.

485
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,670
怎麼能是個男孩
It can't be a boy.

486
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,280
不能是男孩 把他抱走
It can't be a boy. Get it away from me.

487
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,260
- 你得照顧他 - 我不要
- You need to take him. - I don't want it.

488
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,680
他會像他們一樣傷害我
He'll hurt me like they all do.

489
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,410
我以為我懷的是個女孩
I felt for sure i was having a girl.

490
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:36,230
不要啊! 你得送我出去
No,no,no! You gotta get me out of here.

491
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,080
你得帶我離開這兒!
You have to get me out of here!

492
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:48,210
來人吶! 救命! 救救我們!
Help us! Help us! Help us!

493
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,260
****

494
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:58,410
乖乖
**********

495
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,880
沒事的
It's ok.

496
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,480
我們可以利用共犯懷孕了這一點
The partner being pregnant can help us.

497
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,490
讓Garcia查查她的醫療就診記錄
We should have garcia try and find her through doctor visits or medical records.

498
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,830
他是個黑戶 所以她應該也一樣
He basically lived off the grid, which means she did,too.

499
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,450
從他們給受害者拍的照片來看
Judging by the photographs of what they did to the victims,

500
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,620
他們確實與世隔絕
it's safe to say they live in isolation.

501
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,940
他那麼仇恨女性 卻還是和她合作
We've seen his hatred for women,and yet he teams up with her.

502
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,370
什麼樣的女人能讓他有所轉變?
What kind of woman could change him?

503
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,750
你覺得他們是監獄婸{識的嗎?
You think they met in prison?

504
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,010
Garcia已經查遍了 沒有女性探望他
Garcia already went through all of that. He had no female visitors.

505
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,530
那監獄工作人員 醫生或者牧師呢?
What about prison staff, doctors,religious volunteers?

506
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,550
我們查了他監禁期間的所有傭工
We went through a long list of all the vendors who were there during his incarceration.

507
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,720
他們都不在塔拉哈西了
None of them resurfaced in tallahassee.

508
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,880
什麼樣的女人會到監獄堨h 愛上一個強姦犯?
What kind of a woman would go to a prison to fall in love with a rapist?

509
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,870
體質弱 感情脆弱 喜歡暴力男
Someone vulnerable, emotionally fragile, drawn to violent men.

510
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,610
是某個人讓她變成那樣的 經典虐待循環
Someone in her life made her that way. Classic abuse cycle.

511
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,530
可能就是她要去看的人?
What if that's who she was there to visit?

512
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,310
值得一試
It's worth a try.

513
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,280
小甜甜
My sweet.

514
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,940
你有剛才那個監獄的訪客記錄嗎?
Hey,you know the visitor logs from the prison we looked at?

515
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,280
- 早有準備 - 很好 幫我查一下約見記錄
- Still have them at the ready. - Ok,great. I need you to check dates for me.

516
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,370
Burke在押的時候 有沒有去探訪其他囚犯的女性
Were there any women who visited another inmate while burke was there

517
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,560
在Burke出獄之後就再也不去了?
but then suddenly stopped visiting when burke was released?

518
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,620
好 等會兒告訴你
Ok,let me hit you back.

519
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,780
沒事了 不會有事的
It's ok. It's ok.

520
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,060
我幫不了你!
I can't help you!

521
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,390
不會有事的...
It's ok...

522
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,230
開動腦筋了 夥計們
Rev your engines,guys.

523
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,300
從92年到95年 Juliet Monroe 平均每年去看他父親一兩次
Juliet monroe went to visit her father in prison once or twice a year from '92 to '95.

524
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,340
- 他因為什麼入獄? - 強姦
- What was he in for? - Rape.

525

她是他第一個受害者
And she was his primary victim.

526
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,950
他強姦了她 她還每年都去看他?
He raped her and she still went to visit him every year?

527
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,910
她在重複成長過程中的週期
She's repeating the cycle she grew up with.

528
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,190
從95年到97年她開始每月都去看他
Yeah. And she went from visiting him once or twice a year to once a month from '95 to '97.

529
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,040
正是Burke服刑的時候
When burke was serving his time for rape.

530
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,430
沒錯 然後98年到99年她每周去一次
Yeah. And then she increased her visits to once a week all through '98 and '99,

531
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,870
直到那年十月為止

532

因為他被放出來了

You know,we wouldn't be here if you hadn't worked the case as hard as you did.

558
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,550
怎麼會?
How's that?

559
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,370
在她失蹤的地方 無視交通罰單是常事
It would have been an easy thing to miss a routine traffic ticket in the area she disappeared.

560
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,510
你一直在施壓
You kept the pressure on.

561

One card. A straight or a flush, dr. Reid,what are you trying to fill in?

抽一張牌湊到五張順牌的幾率是5比1
Well,considering the odds of filling in an open-ended straight with one card are 5-to-1 against,

569
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,900
而一張牌抽中同花的幾率是4.5比1
while a one-card flush draw is more like 4.5-to-1,

570
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,720
我想你會說 如果我夠聰明的話 就應該湊同花

97比1 你凹凸了
97-to-1. Looks like you're out.

586
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,440
可答案你又接受不了
it means you probably couldn't handle the answer.

587
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,250
這女人真讓人摸不透
There is a whole other side to that woman.

00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,570
- 人家從來沒輸過 - 簡直是百變嬌娃
- I never lose. - A whole other side.

589
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:31,370
我知道環境比遺傳更重要
I know environment plays a bigger role than genetics

590
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,120
