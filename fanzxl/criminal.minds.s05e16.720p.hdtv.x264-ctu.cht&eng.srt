癢 是好癢 所以你才要撓癢癢

這就是Aimee最近的照片麼?

Aimee Lynch 8歲 一小時前 在Ashburn的冬祭活動上被拐走了
Aimee lynch,8 years old, Was taken an hour ago from a winter festival in ashburn.

27
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:42,096

她不見的時候 她媽媽Barbara就在她身邊
Her mom barbara Was right next to her when she vanished.

29
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:47,416
那埵釵n幾百人 沒有人看見任何東西?
There must have been hundreds of people there. No one saw anything?

30
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,986
是個臨時聚會 幾乎沒有什麼保安工作的
It's a temporary gathering, With little to no security.

31
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:51,906
這樣吧 Reid 你跟我去他們家
All right,reid, You and I are going to head to the family's house.

32
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,716
你們倆 你們跟Garcia一起
The two of you, I want you to work with garcia.

33
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,316
查看去年本地所有綁架和綁架未遂案件 看是否有相似情況
We need to look at every local abduction Or attempted one in the past year, See if there's any overlap.

34
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,076
好消息是 現在才是被綁的第二個小時
Good news is that we're barely into the second hour.

35
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:03,336
很可能我們只剩22個小時的機會 把Aimee活著救出來 這就行動吧
Yeah,well,odds are we've only got 22 hours to find aimee alive, So let's do this.

36
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:17,946

She's 4'8",has blond hair and green eyes.

38
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:25,436
頂著嚴寒的天氣和下雪的可能性 搜尋工作壓力非常大
With temperatures below freezing and a chance of snow, The pressure's on to find her.

39
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,856
任何人如果有Aimee的任何消息 請撥打熱線

40
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:33,096

42
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:39,496
帶走Aimee Lynch的人 也帶走了我兒子
Whoever took aimee lynch took my son,too.

43
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:45,596
Ashburn每年都有冬祭  活動中從沒有一起綁架未遂
Ashburn has a winter festival every year, And not a single attempt at kidnapping.

44
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:49,656
JJ 外面有個女人說 她的兒子被同一個人給拐走了
Hey,jj,there's a woman here who says her son Was abducted by the same offender.

45
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:54,056

- Has she been drinking? - Yeah,I'm pretty sure. How'd you know that?

46

Sarah Hillridge 她8年前失去了兒子Charlie
Sarah hillridge. She lost her son charlie 8 years ago.

47
00:02:57,156 --> 00:03:00,676
每次有跟她兒子年齡差不多的小朋友失蹤 她都會來這
She comes in every time a child around his age goes missing.

48
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:02,926

50
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:06,846

51
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:09,606
現在只剩8小時了

52
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:14,956
還要咖啡麼?

53
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,436

56
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:32,136
- Jake把她帶走了 - 什麼?

Well,he got remarried,and,uh, Thought it was best for emily to get a fresh start.

58
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,326
我很遺憾
Sorry.

59
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:44,876
也不能怪他 你看看我這狀況
Well,I can't really blame him. I mean,look at me.

60
00:03:44,886 --> 00:03:48,776
- Sarah 我真得... - 這小女孩Aimee 她8歲 跟Charlie一樣
- Sarah,I really need-- - This little girl aimee was 8, just like charlie.

61
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:51,896
他們相隔了8年被拐走
They were taken almost 8 years apart.

62
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:55,866
我一直在讀有關性吸引方面的資料
Now,I have been doing a lot of reading about sexual attraction

63
00:03:55,886 --> 00:04:02,566
我知道 在前青春期可能性最大 並且男孩女孩都在其中
And know that prepubescence has the greatest range And also a really huge crossover gender-wise.

64
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:07,276
我很抱歉 你都知道了
I'm sorry you know all of that.

65
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:11,186
本可以一輩子都不需要知道這些事 直到有人把我兒子拐走了
I could have gone my whole life without knowing it, But then someone took my son.

66
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:48,836
沒事 我不會傷害你的 過來
It's ok. I'm not gonna hurt you. Come here.

67
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:52,226
過來 來這
Come on,come here.

68
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,956
你叫什麼名字?
What's your name?

69
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:58,236
在他們給你一個新名字之前 你一定要把你的名字告訴我
You gotta tell me your name before they give you a new one.

70
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:02,976
你在幹嗎? 你這是在幹嗎?
What are you doing? What do you think you're doing?

71
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:05,846
這不公平 讓她走!
It's not fair. Let her go!

72
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:11,626
別這麼跟我說話!
Don't talk to me like that!

73
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,086
以後不准這麼跟我說話!
You will never talk to me like that again!

74
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,376
行 知道了
Ok. Got it.

75
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:20,296
當時一個媽媽在找她女兒 Aimee的母親被分散了注意
Aimee's mom was distracted by a mother looking for her daughter,

76
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:22,706
她怪自己不該走神
And she's blaming herself for looking away.

77
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,286
等一下 Sarah... Sarah  Charlie被帶走的時候 她說過同樣的事
Wait. Sarah--sarah said the same thing when charlie was taken.

78
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:30,376
有個母親說兒子丟了 到處找
There was a mother searching for her lost son.

79
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:33,036
你覺得... 你覺得這是個巧合嗎?
Do you... Do you think it's a coincidence?

80
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:35,946
還是... 詭計?
Or what? A ruse?

81
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:39,016
一個女人在找她的兒子  這很具體啊 對吧
A woman looking for her lost son-- That's pretty specific,right?

82
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:42,636
再加上開闊的環境 沒有任何保安? 是的
Add to that a target-rich environment With no security? Yeah.

83
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:47,846
如果那女人是托 故意來分散大家注意 那誰把Aimee帶走了? 同夥?
Ok,so,if the woman was a distraction,who took aimee? A partner?

84
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:52,426
如果是同一撥人 他們都干了快十多了
Well,if it's the same people, They've been doing this for close to a decade.

85
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:56,876
我跟你說過
I told you.

86
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:04,336
* 媽媽會給你買只小羊羔的 *
* mama's gonna buy you a billy goat *

87

<font color=#FF7F00>犯罪心理 第五季 第16集</font>
<font color=#70DBDB>Criminal Minds Season05 Episode16 Mosley Lane</font>

88
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:28,039
尼采寫過 "希望是最邪惡的魔鬼 它不斷延長著人們的痛苦"
Nietzsche wrote, "hope is the worst of evils, For it prolongs the torment of man."

89
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:35,989
- 這樣就結束了? - 沒有
- So that's it,then? - No,it isn't.

90
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,229
那為什麼你們要走了?
Well,why are you leaving?

91
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,729
州里的每個警察都在搜尋你的女兒
Every available cop in the state is out looking for your daughter.

92
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,019
她已經被帶走超過24個小時了
Who's been gone for more than 24 hours.

93
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,729
我想我們都知道那是什麼意思吧
I think we both know what that means.

94
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,009
從概率來看 是沒錯 但是每件案子 都有其特別的地方
Percentile-wise we do, But every case is based on its own merit.

95
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,389
那這次有什麼特別的?
Well,what merit is this case?

96
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,809
先生 帶走Aimee的人 冒著很大風險
Sir,aimee was taken at high risk by whoever took her.

97
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:55,139
意味著這是有組織的行為 有謹慎計劃 很可能犯人不止一個
It means it was organized, meticulously planned, And likely more than one person.

98
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,229
這就意味著 他們有意要留著她
This suggests that they intend on keeping her.

99
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:01,079
留著她? 為什麼? Frank這是咋了?
Keeping her? For what? Frank?

100
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:08,179
留著她就意味著她還活著 我覺得這是你們現在唯一需要關注的
Keeping her means that she's alive, And I think that's really All you need to focus on right now.

101
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,169
你們要走了麼?
Are you leaving?

102
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:13,739
女士 我們的側寫不會變的 而且無數警官和探員也都在找你的女兒
Ma'am,our profile remains, As do hundreds of officers and many agents looking for your daughter.

103
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:17,429
現在 如果有任何和Aimee有關的消息 我們就會回來的
Now,if there's any information Pertaining to aimee, then we'll be back.

104
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:26,379
Lynch先生 您要知道的是 沒有什麼可能阻止他們綁走您的女兒
Mr. Lynch,I think you should know That nothing could have stopped these people From taking your daughter.

105
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,529
換了是我就不會撒手的
Yeah. I would have never let go of her hand.

106
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,289
Frank 別這樣 Frank
Frank,please. Frank.

107
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:37,369
我們已經盡力了
We've done all we can.

108
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,829
但這並不能讓我離開時好受些
It doesn't make walking away any easier.

109
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,139
確實是這樣
No,it doesn't.

110
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,779
他們要叫你Alison
They want to call you alison.

111
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:59,069
但這不是我的名字
But that's not my name.

112
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,359
那你叫什麼?
What is it?

113
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,529
我不能告訴陌生人
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

114
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:09,669
我不是陌生人 我是你哥哥
I'm not a stranger. I'm your brother.

115
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,899
你為什麼帶我來這兒?
Why did you bring me here?

116
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:18,679
他們叫我David
They call me david.

117
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:21,819
我要媽媽
I want my mommy.

118
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:25,159
告訴我你叫什麼
Tell me your name.

119
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:27,349
Aimee
Aimee.

120
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:32,939
好的 Aimee
Ok,aimee.

121
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:51,279
我們都認為Aimee應該還活著 大家都沒有放棄
Look,we all think that aimee could be alive. No one's given up on her.

122
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,569
這就是為什麼上百志願者和警察 在鎮上地毯式搜索
That's why there's hundreds of volunteers and officers Combing every inch of the county.

123
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:56,629
但他們是在河埵b森林塈銕芶
But they're dragging the rivers and digging up the woods.

124
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,279
如果Aimee還活著 還和不明嫌犯在一起 這些方法就都沒什麼用
That's not gonna help us if aimee is still with the unsub, If she's still alive out there.

125
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:02,829
Charlie呢? 他還活著麼?
What about charlie? Is he still alive?

126
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,269
Sarah相信他還活著
Sarah believes it.

127
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:07,109
JJ 八年了 她都在說同樣的話
8 years she's been saying the same thing,jj.

128
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,999
你有沒有想過 為什麼你忽然就開始相信她了?
Have you thought about why you suddenly believe her?

129
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:16,279
你覺不覺得可能因為你做媽媽了?
Do you think it might be because you're a mother?

130
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:22,449
是...是因為這個女人告訴我 八年前就是相同的伎倆
It's--it's because another woman Just walked in here with the same exact ruse Used 8 years ago.

131
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,839
這是事實 不是麼?
I can't deny that. Can you?

132
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:27,069
我要說的不過是 如果不把這看成一起單獨的綁架案
All I'm saying is, if we go from a single abduction

133
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:30,189
而是一個持續10年的連環綁架 一切就都不一樣了
To multiple abductions over 10 years, That changes everything.

134
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:34,329
我們必須依靠沒有偏見的側寫 來推斷這到底是什麼性質
We all have to be convinced that's what it is, Based on an unbiased profile.

135
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:37,789
失蹤的孩子干擾了家長
Ok. Distraction of a lost child.

136
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,579
在幾乎沒有保安的公共場所 八齡童被綁架
8-year-old victims taken from public places With little to no security.

137
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,789
這不僅僅是相同伎倆 這是個性簽名
That's not just the same ruse. That's a signature.

138
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,149
- 我可不是個母親 - Charlie現在應該16了
- And I'm not a mother. - Charlie would be 16 now.

139
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,349
我們都知道 有偏好的犯人傾向在 被害人進入青春期前把他們殺掉
We all know that preferential offenders Typically dispose of their victims Before they reach puberty.

140
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,619
或許Charlie還有別的用處
Maybe he serves another purpose.

141
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,939
Aimee的媽媽說不明嫌犯很瘦小
Aimee's mom said the unsub was slight.

142
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,689
要讓一個十幾歲的孩子老實聽話可不容易
It wouldn't be easy to keep a teenager under her thumb.

143
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,269
但她從他八歲時就和他在一起了
Except that she's had him since he was 8 years old.

144
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,809
到了現在 他已經完全服從於她了
By now,he's completely submissive to her.

145
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,329
把Charlie留在身邊也解釋了 我們為什麼從來沒有找到他的屍體
Keeping him could explain Why charlie's body was never found.

146
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:11,689
- Garcia - 您說
- Garcia. - Sir.

147
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,729
全國範圍追查十年內的記錄
Go back 10 years nationwide.

148
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,289
從潛在目標較多地點的綁架開始
Start with abductions and target-rich environments.

149
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:19,229
排除其中找到屍體或者救回人質的
Rule out any with bodily recovery, dead or alive.

150
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,479
- 我去告訴Sarah - 好的
- I'm gonna let sarah know. - Ok.

151
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:24,619
現在我們要從全新的視角 看Aimee被綁架的現場
We need to check out aimee's abduction site With new eyes.

152
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,329
- 他們回來了 - 誰呀?
- They're home. - Who is?

153
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,979
照他們說的做 明白麼? 這樣不會吃苦頭
Do what they say. Ok? It'll make it easier.

154
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:46,669
David! 你在這兒幹嘛?
David! What are you doing here?

155
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,749
又在照相麼?
Taking pictures again?

156
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,999
快給我滾出去! 滾出去
Now get the hell out of here! Get out.

157
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:57,129
Well...

158
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,649
好像有人睡在金髮姑娘的床上咯
Looks like somebody's been sleeping In goldilocks' bed.

159
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:09,029
這下面是什麼呦? 看看
What have we got under here? Let's take a little look-see.

160
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:15,199
你好啊
Well,hello there.

161
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,089
我想回家
I just want to go home.

162
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,269
Alison 你現在就在家呀
You are home,alison.

163
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,199
Sarah?
Sarah?

164
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,439
- Jane 現場還交還給你 - 謝謝 Bill
- Back to you,jane. - Thanks,bill.

165
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,669
- Aimee Lynch最後被看到時 穿了一件大衣... - Sarah 我是Jennifer
- Aimee lynch was last seen wearing a winter coat... - Sarah,it's jennifer.

166
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,039
當時她和家人在參加Ashburn的冬祭嘉年華
She was with her family at the winter festival In ashburn.

167
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:48,209
警方正在調查這起案子 所以她的家人還沒有發佈正式聲明
The family has not put out a statement yet, As the authorities are handling the case.

168
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:51,609
如果您有關於Aimee的線索 請撥打我們的熱線
Anyone with information about aimee Please contact the hotline.

169
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,769
Sarah?
Sarah?

170
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,239
側寫我並不難是不是?
Not hard to profile,is it?

171
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,509
你覺得我瘋了麼?
You think I'm insane?

172
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:20,929
- 沒有 - 那你怎麼想的?
- No. - What do you think?

173
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:23,929
我跟你一個想法
I think the same thing you do.

174
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,989
你什麼意思?
What do you mean?

175
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:34,469
我覺得綁了Aimee的 就是綁了Charlie的人
I think the same people that took aimee Took charlie.

176
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:42,509
我有東西給你看
I want to show you something.

177
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,079
2000年以來 超過200個兒童的屍體沒有被找到
Since 2000,over 200 children's bodies have not been found.

178
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,979
這是全國範圍 那在弗州呢?
Nationwide. What about virginia?

179
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:49,319
一共有12起失蹤或假定死亡
Of the missing and presumed dead, there are 12.

180
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,239
Charlie在這個名單上呆了八年了 Aimee剛剛也上了這個名單
Uh,charlie's been on the list for 8 years, Aimee just joined it.

181
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,219
那麼 Aimee是在Ashburn被綁架的 Charlie是八年前在Leesburg被綁架的
So aimee was taken from ashburn, Charlie from leesburg,8 years ago,

182
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:00,809
都是在距離高速半英里以內的地方 其他那些呢?
Both within a half mile of the highway. What about the others?

183
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:05,109
Karla Hartway在1999年被綁架 當時她八歲 是在Garrisonville
Karla hartway was abducted in 1999, Age 8,from garrisonville.

Abducted June 12 at 4:00 from the mall.

186
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,459
他家長離婚了 他還沒有被找到
Parents divorced. He's still missing.

187
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,469
這些花是什麼意思?
What do the flowers mean?

188
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:19,099
找到他們的時候都死了
They were all found dead.

189
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,719
其他的都還沒有找到
But all the rest are still missing.

190
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:26,279
比如Tracey Cain 九歲 從公園消失了 兩個家長當時都在場
Like tracey cain,9, She vanished from a park, both parents present.

191
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:30,289

And then jake wusman, abducted September 29 From rock creek park.

- 還有 還有... - Sarah
- And then there's-- - Sarah.

194
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:42,789
如果你想幫我們 就幫我做一件事
If you're gonna help us, I need you to do something for me.

195
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,749
你儘管說
Anything.

196
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,079
別再酗酒了
Stop drinking.

197
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:51,469
可以可以 沒問題
I can do that. I can do that.

198
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,349
我們不應該帶Barbara回來麼?
Shouldn't we bring barbara back here?

199
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,309
不 她已經盡力了 讓我們再過一遍
No,she's given us all she can. Let's go through it.

200
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,639
好的 她當時差不多站在這兒對吧?
Ok. She was standing about here,right?

201
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,349
現場很擁擠 全家都在
It's crowded. Families all around.

202
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:10,869
你餓了麼? 走 買點吃的去
Are you hungry? Come on. Let's get something.

203
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,699
不明嫌犯在觀察 等待最佳目標
The unsubs are watching and waiting for the best target.

204
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,309
我要騎那匹帶斑點的
I want to ride the spotted one.

205
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,769
好撓哦
It' too scratchy.

206
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,479
- 然後她聽到了喊聲 - Lindsay!
- Then she hears it. - Lindsay!

207
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:28,139
Lindsay! Lindsay! 有人看見我女兒了麼?
Lindsay! Lindsay! Has anyone seen my daughter?

208
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,039
她轉回身來的時候 Aimee已經不見了
By the time she turns around, aimee's gone.

209
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,459
那個喊狼來了的媽媽這時就不見了
The mother who just cried wolf moves off.

210
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,639
她可以聽到Barbara哭喊著找Aimee 但是...
She can hear barbara crying out for aimee,but...

211
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:41,639
Aimee不能回答她 因為不明嫌犯把她的頭埋在了自己胸前
Aimee can't answer Because the unsub has her face buried in his chest.

212
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:46,849
路人看到 覺得不過是家長抱著自己哭泣的孩子
To passersby, it looked like any parent Carrying a crying child.

213
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,759
30秒之後 她就被關進了車...
30 seconds later, She's concealed in the vehicle...

214
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:53,799
然後他們就離開了
And they're gone.

215
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,229
這輛車再去接那個媽媽 她上車 任務完成
The same one rolls up on our mother, She gets in,it's done.

216
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:00,089
誰在開車?
Who's driving it?

217
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,449
這至少需要三個不明嫌犯
It took 3 unsubs to pull this off.

218
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,819
如果也是這些人綁了Charlie 那就是團伙犯罪
If the same people took charlie, We're looking for a group.

219
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,639
他們在八年內至少拐走了兩個小孩
Well,if they've taken 2 or more children Over an 8-year period,

220
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,329
肯定會有人覺察到的
somebody must have noticed something.

221
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,989
他們怎麼隱藏受害人?
How do they keep the victims hidden?

222
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,379
- 弄清這個咱們就能找到他們了 - 不明嫌犯?
- Once we figure that out, we'll find them. - The unsubs?

223
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,389
還有孩子們
And the children.

224
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,369
- 這些花真漂亮 - 謝謝
- Beautiful,aren't they? - Thank you.

225
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:03,749
每株都是我親手種的
I planted each and every one of them myself.

226
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,889
我把這些玫瑰花看做被遺忘的靈魂
I like to think of these roses As the souls of the forgotten.

227
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:12,279
就好像這個年輕人
Like... This poor young man here.

228
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:27,783
Hotch 這是Sarah Hillridge
Hotch,uh,this is sarah hillridge.

229
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,143
Charlie被拐走的時候我們見過面
Oh,we met when charlie was taken.

230
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:33,973
我們這樣的人你肯定見過不少 看起來都是一個樣子
I mean,you know, you saw a lot of us. I'm sure we all look the same.

231
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:37,023
謝謝你能來 坐吧
Thank you for coming in. Have a seat.

232
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:41,143
這代表從公共場所被拐的小孩
All right,these represent kids Taken from public places.

233
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:44,873
每個案發地都不同 但有一個共同點
Locations are never hit more than once, But there is similarity in each.

234
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:49,253
商場 玩具店 嘉年華 遊樂場 遊行
Different malls,toy stores, Carnivals,theme parks,parades.

235
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:51,413
一家人本該感到安全的地方
Places where families should feel safe.

236
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:53,283
安保也不是很嚴
And where there isn't much security.

237
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:55,903
10年12個孩子?
That's 12 children over 10 years?

238
00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:57,653
我們應該到每一家去探訪
We should interview all the families.

239
00:17:57,673 --> 00:18:00,193
有幾家我認識 我們有個互助小組
I know a few of them. We had a support group.

240
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:02,713
很多人已經離開了
I mean,most of them have moved on.

241
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,183
可你還在這兒
But you're here.

242
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:10,123
3年前我看到了Charlie
I saw charlie 3 years ago.

243
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,803
你沒跟我提過這事
You didn't tell me that.

244
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,183
連我丈夫都不相信我 更別說你了
Well,my husband didn't believe me. Why would you?

245
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:20,113
說說怎麼回事
Tell us what happened.

246
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,683
一開始有段時間我一直看到他
At first,I saw him all the time.

247
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:25,983
我以為我看見了 據我所知這很正常
I thought I did, and from what I understand, That's normal.

248
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:28,153
可你不能就這麼過下去
But you can't survive that way.

249
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,743
所以我和Jake決定搬走
So jake and I promised that we would move on.

250
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:34,483
可幾年後我又看見他了 這次不一樣
But a few years later,I saw him. I mean,it was different.

251
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:38,653
在我的印象堨L一直沒長大 可我看見的Charlie已經十幾歲了
I mean,in my mind he had never aged, But this was a teenage charlie crossing the street.

252
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:42,173
他很快就不見了 但我肯定看見他了
And as quick as he was there he was gone again, But I know I saw him.

253
00:18:42,473 --> 00:18:45,423
Jake不相信我
Jake didn't believe me.

254
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:48,103
他就是那天離開我的
That was the day he left me.

255
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:50,793
看見Charlie的時候你做了什麼?
What did you do when you saw charlie?

256
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:54,273
我喊他來著
I called for him.

257
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:59,703
- Charlie! - 你怎麼知道那是他?
- Charlie! - How did you know it was him?

258
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:02,753
我不確定 所以我又喊了一次
Well,I didn't,not for sure, so I called for him again.

259
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:05,603
- Charlie! - 他聽見了嗎?
- Charlie! - Did he hear you?

260
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,073
- 他回頭了 - 你丈夫沒看到他?
- He looked back. - And your husband didn't see him?

261
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,503
Charlie
Charlie.

262
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:14,343
人很多 他不見了 我又把他弄丟了
It was crowded. He disappeared. I lost him all over again.

263
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:19,463
我們要找那些家長重新登記備案
We'll be asking those parents To sign up for all that pain again.

264
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:21,443
如果他們搬走了...
If they've moved on...

265
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:25,293
如果能找回孩子 他們會試試看的
They'd take the chance if it meant their kids were alive.

266
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:47,043
頭髮再亂一點 長到脖子
Just flare up that hair a little bit more, And it went farther down his neck.

267
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,983
眉毛沒有那麼濃
His--his eyebrows are not quite as full.

268
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,843
Stephen失蹤了7年了?
Stephen's been missing 7 years?

269
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:58,703
是二月份 他現在該有15歲了
In February. He'd be 15 now.

270
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:01,453
你最後見到他是在玩具櫃檯?
And you last saw him in the toy section?

271
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:05,663
那是Sarah Hillridge?
That sar hillridge?

272
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,843
- 你認識她嗎? - 我們原來是朋友
- Do you know her? - We were friends.

273
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,823
我們都在互助小組
We were in a support group together.

274
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,693
Stephen是在Charlie之後一年被拐的
Stephen was taken the year after charlie.

275
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,183
- 你知道她瘋瘋癲癲的嗎? - 別管她了
- You know she's crazy? - Leave her alone.

276
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,233
- 她就是瘋子 - 不 這我可不知道
- She is. - No,sir,I don't know that.

277
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:20,883
盼著兒子回家不說
Wishing for your boy to come home is one thing.

278
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:23,083
她都自暴自棄了
She threw her whole life away.

279
00:20:23,113 --> 00:20:26,423
她丈夫是個好人 而她連她的乖女兒都不能...
Her husband's a good man, And she's got a daughter who she can't even--

280
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:31,703
- 她為什麼要毀掉這一切? - 希望能使人麻痹
- Why would she ruin that? - Hope can be paralyzing,sir.

281
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:36,583
我們認為帶走Aimee Lynch的人 做這事已經很長時間了
We believe that the people who took aimee lynch Have been doing this for a very long time.

282
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,943
昨天的那個小姑娘?
The little girl yesterday?

283
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:42,333
你兒子失蹤前有沒有特別的事發生?
In the moments before your son was taken, Did anything stand out?

284
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:44,573
比如說?
Like what?

285
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:47,473
能把你注意力從他身上引開的事?
Anything at all that drew your attention away from him?

286
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:52,843
有那麼一會兒 可我沒在意 有個女的
Just for a moment, But I never thought anything about it. That woman.

287
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:55,823
- 在找他的兒子 - 我幫了她的忙
- Looking for her son. - I helped her.

288
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:00,893
天吶 她還謝我來著
Oh,god. She even thanked me for helping.

289
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:02,703
世事難料
You couldn't have known.

290
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:05,083
她就在我面前 怎麼拐走Stephen?
She was right in front of me. How could she have taken stephen?

291
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:07,313
因為她不是單獨作案
Because she's not working alone.

292
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,513
他們用這把戲製造了多起綁架
They've used this ruse in a dozen local abductions.

293
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:15,043
叫我們來就因為這個?
Is that why we're here?

294
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:19,963
他對我們都是這麼做的?
They've done this to all of us?

295
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:23,173
你覺得Stephen有可能還活著嗎?
Do you think there's a chance stephen's still alive?

296
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,853
- 一共有多少人? - 你是第四個
- How many are there? - You're the fourth.

297
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:41,433
但是以前還有過其他人
But there have been others.

298
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:45,263
- 他們人呢? - 在更好的地方
- Where are they? - Someplace better.

299
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:48,803
他們要叫我們吃晚飯了
They're gonna get us for supper.

300
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:51,443
可我不餓
But I'm not hungry.

301
00:21:51,923 --> 00:21:56,093
你最喜歡吃什麼? 冰激凌?
What's your favorite food? Ice cream?

302
00:21:58,423 --> 00:22:03,253
就假裝是冰激凌 然後都吃光 好嗎?
Pretend it's ice cream And eat it all up. Ok?

303
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:06,493
我想媽咪
I want my mommy.

304
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:26,143
你有好幫手 他們最厲害了
You're in good hands. There's no one better than them.

305
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,573
我知道
I know.

306
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:37,083
我放開了她的手
I let go of her hand.

307
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:44,323
就那麼幾秒鐘 可我一直擔心的是她
It was only for a second, But she's always been the one that I worried about.

308
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,503
- 你不能自責 - Frank責怪我
- You can't blame yourself. - Frank does.

309
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:50,503
他說得對 我應該握住不放的
And he's right. I should have held on.

310
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:56,723
Aimee以前走丟過...
Aimee's wandered off before,and...

311
00:22:57,403 --> 00:23:01,603
孩子不見了的時候 就有種感覺
There's this feeling when they're out of your sight.

312
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:06,623
除非再看見他們 否則無法呼吸
It takes your breath away until you see them again.

313
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:11,013
所以我覺得我喘不過氣來
And I think that's why I can't breathe.

314
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:19,223
11個家庭都指認了同一個女人 40到50歲 在呼喊她的孩子
11 families have confirmed the same woman, 40 to 50 years old, calling for children.

315
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,293
有時她還會帶著一個小孩
In some cases, she even had a child with her.

316
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:23,773
她利用小孩進行綁架?
She actually used the kids for the abductions?

317
00:23:23,783 --> 00:23:26,083
她自己的還是拐來的孩子?
Were they her own or the ones kidnapped?

318
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,073
我們認為她沒有孩子
We don't believe she's a mother.

319
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:31,283
大多數有傾向的女性罪犯都沒有
Most predisposed female offenders are not.

320
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:33,683
但她們是最暴力的
But they are the most violent.

321
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:38,103
你說她有同夥?
Y-you said that she's working with someone?

322
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:40,353
可能是個順從的男性
It's likely a subservient male.

323
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:42,433
但這個女人把自己和同夥隔開
But the woman separates herself from her partners.

324
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:45,383
她挑選受害人 同夥去冒險
She chooses the victim while they do the riskiest part--

325
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:47,713
他們抓了孩子就跑
They grab the child and manage the getaway.

326
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:50,133
這是他的青少年版
This is what he looks like as a teenager.

327
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:55,303
他又瘦又高 頭髮顏色也變深了
um,he's tall and thin. His hair is,um, darker than it was.

328
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:59,663
這就是他 這是Charlie
But--but that's him. That's--that's charlie.

329
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,913
他們為什麼冒險讓他出來?
Why would they take the risk Of letting him out in the world?

330
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:06,093
他們把他囚禁了8年
They've had him under their control for 8 years.

331
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:09,053
他要麼已經開始依賴罪犯 要麼就是受到了威脅
He's either got stockholm or he's being threatened.

332
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:14,143
"再抓一個小孩來 我們就不殺你"
"get us another kid, And we won't kill you."

333
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:18,243
Sarah... 去歇一會兒 好嗎?
Sarah... Let's take a break,ok?

334
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:22,843
好的 謝謝
Ok. Ok. Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:30,653
好了 在北弗吉尼亞州生活和工作
All right. So living and working in northern virginia.

336
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,713
相當於與世隔絕
It's most likely in isolation.

337
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:36,873
有一屋子小孩 鄰里間很難說清
I mean,there's no way to explain a houseful of kids At the neighborhood block party.

338
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:39,003
管住這麼多小孩可不容易
Managing this many children isn't easy.

339
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:41,603
應該有不符計劃的事件發生
There have to be incidents where things didn't go as planned.

340
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:43,983
我們從國內長途電話和騷擾事件開始
We should start with domestic calls and disturbances.

341
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:46,303
特別注意那些被 社會福利機構拜訪過的家庭
Concentrate on families who were visited by social services.

342
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:48,623
我去告訴Garcia
I'll get garcia.

343
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:51,823
很可能這些不明疑犯之前都被問過話
It's likely these unsubs were questioned before.

344
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:55,143
一旦我們縮小Garcia列出來的名單範圍 我們就要重新拜訪他們了
Once we narrow down garcia's list, we should revisit them.

345
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:58,043
這一長段時間  他們對Charlie都做了什麼
What they've been doing to charlie this whole time,

346
00:24:58,073 --> 00:25:03,343
哦 我曾經希望他就這麼走了  這樣就不用每天都受折磨了
Oh,there were times that I had hoped he was dead Just so he wouldn't suffer every day.

347
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:09,093
我們知道這些罪犯 很擅長拐騙和隱藏受害者
We know these offenders are skilled at abductions And hiding their victims.

348
00:25:09,113 --> 00:25:12,723
一般情況下  我們直到真相大白才回過神來
Usually,we don't know that until after the fact.

349
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:17,883
而你把我們引向那些罪犯  這樣的情況很少見
What you've brought us, to them,is rare.

350
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:22,153
我知道 但結果不會皆大歡喜的
I know,but it's not gonna end well for all of us.

351
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:24,903
我認出他了 他就在那兒
I recognize him. He was there.

352
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:26,213
當我們排隊的時候
When we were in line.

353
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,343
他的年齡去騎小馬不合適 我本該明白的
He was too old for the ponies. I should have known that.

354
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:29,493
我們身後沒幾個人 他就在其中
He was a few people behind us.

355
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:32,713
- 你也看到他了 - 是啊 他看上去就像平常小孩一樣
- You saw him,too. - Yeah. He seemed like a normal kid.

356
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:36,593
- 他還活著? - 等下 這是你的兒子?
- He's still alive. - Wait,this is your son?

357
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:40,173
- Charlie - 你兒子帶走了我孩子?
- Charlie. - Your son took my baby?

358
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:42,273
- Lynch夫人... - 你兒子帶走了Aimee?
- Mrs. Lynch- - Your son took aimee?

359
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:44,653
- 親愛的 別這樣... - 他是 他是他們中的一員
- Honey,come on. - He's--he's one of them.

360
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:46,543
他帶走無辜的孩子們
He's taking innocent children.

361
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,513
Aimee只有8歲 她根本無力防範
Aimee is 8 years old. She can't defend herself.

362
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:51,793
他明明知道! 他就這樣看著她!
And he knew that! He watched her!

363
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:54,763
他跟其他罪犯一樣邪惡
He's as bad as the rest of them.

364
00:25:59,003 --> 00:26:02,233
- 她說的對 - 不 不 不 Charlie別無選擇
- She's right. - No,no,no. Charlie didn't have a choice.

365
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:04,143
他已經是他們中的一員了  他要怎樣才能忘記這樣的經歷?
He's one of them now. How is he ever going to forgethat?

366
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:07,383
他只是試圖活命
He's just trying to survive.

367
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:14,253
好吧 天啊
Ok. My god.

368
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:22,403
求你 別離開
Please stay with me.

369
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:26,493
- 她會來看你的 - 求你了
- She'll check on you. - Please.

370
00:26:26,893 --> 00:26:30,383
就一會兒
Just for a minute.

371
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,293
誰讓你進來的?
Who let you in here?

372
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,983
求你了 抓我吧 別傷害她
Please,take me. Don't hurt her.

373
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:58,823
求你 別走
Please don't leave me.

374
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:33,777
好了 過去十年有107個家庭 被社會福利機構拜訪過
Ok,there are 107 families Visited by social services in the last 10 years.

375
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,077
這樣一家一家來也太多了
That's too many to go door to door.

376
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,607
我們得縮小範圍
We're gonna have to narrow that down.

377
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:39,147
我們必須知道 為什麼他們 一直待在北弗吉尼亞州
We need to figure out why they're staying In northern virginia.

378
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,607
他們的工作可能是關鍵
Their work could be the key.

379
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:43,817
他們在那個地區可能 有個兒童福利院作掩護
They could have a child-care facility on the premises as a cover.

380
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:47,367
這很有可能是個單方收入家庭  夫妻中有一人必須待在家媟蚥U孩子
You know,it's most likely a single income family. Someone has to be home to stay with the kids.

381
00:27:47,377 --> 00:27:49,187
好的 這些想法都有用
Ok,all this helps.

382
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:52,407
他們之前都被問過話  所以我們要明白他們可能在演戲
They've been questioned before, So we can expect a rehearsed response.

383
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:55,457
- 單子上有多少是單方收入家庭? - 23個
- How many on that list are single income? - 23.

384
00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:57,717
有什麼問題麼?
What's the problem?

385
00:27:57,737 --> 00:28:02,357
我們要逐個敲開23個家門  而他們每個人都可能傷害過孩子
We're gonna be knocking on the doors of 23 families And all of them have done something bad to a kid.

386
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:05,817
我們沒有搜查令 只有側寫
We don't have a warrant. Just our profile.

387
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:07,337
如果我們搞錯了 又離開了那個家
If we get it wrong and leave that house,

388
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:10,587
他們會銷毀一切證據 包括孩子們
They'll destroy any evidence they have, including the children.

389
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:17,657
JJ 去找件Aimee穿過的衣服
Jj,get an article of aimee's clothing.

390
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:20,637

391
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:24,317
給狗聞
It's for the dogs.

392
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:31,607
- 別管了 - 不 我做不到
- Leave it alone. - No,I can't.

393
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:34,317
你做得到的
Yes,you can.

394
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:40,027
8年了?
8 years?

395
00:28:40,037 --> 00:28:44,767
在我早上醒來的那一瞬間...
There's a moment In the morning, just as I wake up...

396
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:48,887
有過那麼半秒的平和
Where there's a split-second of peace.

397
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:53,377
之後 就又回到這種狀態
And then,it all comes back. All of it.

398
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,317
是啊 我到現在都沒合眼
Yeah. I haven't slept yet.

399
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:02,167
我希望你能在需要睡覺之前找到她
I hope you get her back before you need to.

400
00:29:03,857 --> 00:29:09,097
如果你這些年來從不曾相信  你的兒子還活著
If you didn't believe for all those years That your son was still alive,

401
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:11,007
那麼現在我們誰也不會在這兒
None of us would be here now.

402
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:13,757
如果他死了 我會感應到的
I would have felt if he was gone.

403
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:21,877
- 我需要Aimee的一件衣物 - 為什麼?
- I need an item of aimee's clothing. - Why?

404
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:26,607
