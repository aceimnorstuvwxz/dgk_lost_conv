1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,760
從前...
Once upon a time...

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,340
有一個孤獨的國王
There was a lonely king.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,420
他不分晝夜的
He spent many days and many nights

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,100
流浪著  尋找著
Wandering   searching

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,760
尋找那個獨一無二的人
Looking for that one special someone.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,620
晚安
Good night.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,590
晚安  Jody
Good night   Jody.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,290
晚安  Clemons太太
Good night   Mrs. Clemons.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,520
那樣一個
That...One...

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,540
完美的...女人
Perfect...Woman

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,130
誰將成為他的王后呢
Who would be his queen.

12
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,360
爸爸
Daddy!

13
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,230
我一直等你來看我
I was hoping you'd come tonight.

14
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,600
能再給我講個故事嗎
Can you tell me another story?

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,100
這個
Well...

16
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,100
只要你乖乖躺著
If you lay back down there

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,600
閉上你的小眼睛
And close your little eyes.

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,570
閉上眼睛
Close your eyes.

19
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,100
孤獨的國王向更遙遠的地方進發
And the lonely king searched far and wide

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,330
尋找那個會成為他王后的女人
Looking for this woman who would be his queen.

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,370
新墨西哥州  科林斯角

22
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,430
就在他即將絕望的時候
He had almost given up hope of ever finding her

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,600
他來到一個小酒館
When he came upon this small tavern...

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,000
看到了一個普通的鄉村女侍者
With a simple country barmaid.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,400
這時  她看了孤獨的國王一眼
Now   when she looked at the lonely king

26
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,140
國王覺得他們好像已經相知相識
He felt as if they had known each other

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,710
千年之久
For a thousand years.

28
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,310
你需要添些酒嗎
Do you need a refill?

29
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,610
Tanya  我估計我要自己回家了
Tanya   I guess I'm going home alone.

30
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,650
失陪一下
Excuse me a second.

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,580
首先  你不是一個人
First of all   you're not alone.

32
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,880
第二  你不能開車了
And secondly   you're not driving.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,250
鑰匙拿來
Keys.

34
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,120
Betty  給Sam叫輛出租車
Betty   Sam needs a cab.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,720
好的
Sure.

36
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,360
真奇怪
That's weird.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,730
你看到那位老兄去哪了嗎
Did you see where that guy went?

38
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,900
他在等待時機
So he waited

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,430
直到她獨自一個人的時候
Until she was alone

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,870
從遠處靜靜的望著她
Watching from afar

41
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,930
因為國王害怕和她說話
Because he was afraid to speak to her.

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,440
直到有一天
And then one day...

43
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,940
她的馬車壞了
Her carriage wouldn't start.

44
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,910
國王心想
And the king thought...

45
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,110
這是命運的安排
This is fate.

46
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,620
所以他單騎下山去營救她
And so he rode down to rescue her.

47
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,950
她對國王說
And she said to him...

48
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,820
都怪這大雨
Must be the rain.

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,620
打開引擎蓋
Pop the hood.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,160
謝謝
Thank you!

51
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,590
國王把她救了嗎  爸爸
Did he rescue her   daddy?

52
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,760
她是國王的真命天女嗎
Was she the one?

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,820
國王是這麼想的
Well   the king thought so.

54
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,060
現在試試
Try it now!

55
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,930
好了
Yes...

56
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,930
嗨  我非常感激
Hey   I appreciate your--

57
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,900
嗨
Hello?

58
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,000
人呢
Hello?

59
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,830
你還好嗎
You ok?

60
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,900
然後他們一起騎著駿馬消失在黑夜中
So they rode off into the night together.

61
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,900
最後他們在一起了嗎
And they lived happily ever after?

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,070
沒有  寶貝
Well   no   sweet pea.

63
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,510
她不是國王要找的人
She wasn't the one.

64
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,440
不過別擔心
But don't worry.

65
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,310
國王永遠不會停止追尋
The king's never gonna stop looking.

66
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,410
如果他永遠也找不到王后怎麼辦呢
What if he never finds a queen?

67
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,150
這樣的話  他就會
Well   then he'll just--

68
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,310
我們就會去一個更好的地方
We'll just go to a better place.

69
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,220
晚安  公主
Good night   princess.

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,030
她名叫Tanya Hill  29歲  是一個酒館的侍者
Her name was Tanya Hill. She was 29   a bartender.

71
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,630
兩天前在新墨西哥州的艾吉伍德被發現
Found 2 days ago in Edgewood   New Mexico.

72
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,500
她是6個月內的第五名受害女子
She's the fifth woman in over 6 months

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,170
被棄屍在40號和25號州際公路旁的溝渠中
To be found dead in a ditch off the I-40 and I-25.

74
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,480
被兇手徒手勒死  沒有性侵犯跡象
All were manually strangled. None were sexually assaulted.

75
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,840
也許勒死受害人能使他獲得心理滿足
Well   maybe the act of strangulation is what gets him off.

76
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,710
她們在哪堻Q劫持的
Where were they abducted from?

77
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,850
哪堻ㄕ
All over.

78
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,280
他們不僅僅跨越了州界
Well   they're not just crossing state lines.

79
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,820
案發的城市彼此間更是相距數百英里
These cities are hundreds of miles apart.

80
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,350
死了這麼多人  我們為何才接到協助請求呢
That's a lot of bodies. Why is it taking so long to be invited?

81
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,190
還沒有協助請求  我們從公路連環殺手數據庫瞭解到這個情況
We haven't been invited. We found this on HSK database.

82
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,130
很多地方警局都不希望惹上這個麻煩
Well   a lot of police departments won't want this problem.

83
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,860
地理側寫顯示只有一個地方有麻煩
The geographic profile shows that only one of them has it.

84
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,300
他們只是還沒意識到
They just don't know it yet.

85
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,430
-你怎麼知道  -因為他有一個慣性活動區域
- How do you know that? - Because he has a comfort zone

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,870
取決於他前往拋屍地點的方向
Based on the direction he was heading when he dumped the bodies.

87
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,140
全部5個案件說明這個不明嫌犯
All 5 cases point to our unsub

88
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,370
前往的地方是新墨西哥州的艾吉伍德
Heading to edgewood   new mexico.

89
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,310
也是我們要去的地方
Now so are we.

90
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,430
你搭車來的
You got a ride.

91
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,430
你好
Hi!

92
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
不好意思
Oh. Excuse me.

93
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
你把這個落在桌子上了
I think you forgot these.

94
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,710
嘻嘻
Hee hee!

95
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,770
你好可愛啊
You are so cute.

96
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,040
拜
Bye!

97
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,580
拜拜
Goodbye.

98
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,050
你知不知道誰往西邊走
Do you know anyone that's heading west?

99
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,610
真抱歉
Hmm. Sorry.

100
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,610
我去
I am.

101
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
太好了
Great.

102
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:18,500
犯罪心理  第5季第17集
Criminal Minds S05E17

103
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,250
劇作家田納西·威廉姆斯曾說
Tennessee Williams said

104
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,990
我們所有人都在自己的軀殼內
"We're all of us sentenced to solitary confinement

105
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,390
被孤獨的囚禁終生
Inside our own skins   for life."

106
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,820
很明顯這個不明嫌犯不在乎受害人被發現
Clearly this unsub doesn't care about his victims being found.

107
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,920
或者說他覺得通過受害人無法查到他
Or he knows he can't be linked to them.

108
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,090
法醫鑒定報告支撐了這個觀點
The M.E.'s report supports that.

109
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,230
5個受害人身上發現同一組DNA
Matching DNA was found on all 5 victims.

110
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,330
-但是在數據庫堿d不到人  -是的
- But not in any database. - Right.

111
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,470
受害人特徵和劫持地點都很有規律
It's also in keeping with the victimology and abduction sites.

112
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,430
什麼規律
Which are what?

113
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,870
富人區和善待罪犯的區域
Target rich and offender friendly.

114
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,540
不同被劫持者的死亡時間
Time of death from time of abduction

115
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,040
有很顯著的不同
Varies dramatically in each case.

116
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,640
一些人12小時後被害  一些則是24小時後
Some lived 12 hours   others 24 before they were killed.

117
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,380
那麼他劫持他們幹什麼呢
So what's he doing with them?

118
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,640
他不與她們發生性行為
Well   he's not having sex with them.

119
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,480
沒有折磨甚至被捆綁的跡象
There's no sign of torture or even restraints.

120
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,810
DNA來自身體的什麼部位
What was the matching DNA?

121
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,220
皮膚  在5個受害人的指甲
Uh   skin. That and metal shavings were found

122
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,520
殘留著一些皮膚碎屑和金屬粉末
Under the fingernails of all 5 victims.

123
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,190
Tanya只剩下一個手指蓋
Tanya only had one nail left.

124
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,350
一個手指蓋嗎
One nail?

125
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,520
恩  看起來無論被關在哪
Yeah. It looks like whatever she was in

126
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,160
她一直想方設法的逃出來
She tried to claw her way out.

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,190
JJ  讓Garcia將受害人類型和劫持地點
JJ   have Garcia match victimology

128
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,100
與公路連環殺手數據庫中一年內的數據進行比對
And abduction sites to hsk findings for the last year.

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,560
如果他繼續按照這個時間表作案
If he sticks to this timeline

130
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,270
艾吉伍德很快就會再發現一具屍體
Edgewood is about to discover another body.

131
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,380
她在此向西32.9英里的地方被劫持
So she was abducted 32.9 miles west of here

132
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,010
也就是說  如果他們沒有超速行駛的話
Which means if they drove the speed limit

133
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,950
他們最多只花30分鐘就到這
They got here in 30 minutes or less.

134
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,320
那麼  要走到那個水溝
So   how long's it gonna take you

135
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,720
需要花多少時間呢
to get in that ditch?

136
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,320
你是叫我去嗎
Get in that ditch?

137
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,620
我膝蓋中過槍  還記得吧
I got shot in the knee   remember?

138
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,020
醫生說我不可以作任何攀爬
My doctor said I'm not allowed to do any climbing.

139
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,920
只是個水溝而已
It's a ditch.

140
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,090
怕弄髒新靴子  是吧
New boots   huh?

141
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,260
是意大利皮革嗎
Italian leather?

142
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,500
沒錯  我也沒轍
Yeah   what can I tell you?

143
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,130
那麼
So   uh

144
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,770
任何路過的汽車都能看到我
from here I can be seen by any passing vehicle.

145
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,300
但是看不到我
And I can't.

146
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,770
她在晚上被拋屍
So she was dumped at night.

147
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,870
肯定沒錯
Must have.

148
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,940
他開車過來
He drives up

149
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,610
扔了屍體
Dumps the body.

150
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,510
完工  離開
Job done   he leaves.

151
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,240
我不這麼認為
I don't think so.

152
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,480
什麼
What?

153
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,080
5位受害者被發現的時候都是像胎兒一樣蜷縮著
All 5 victims were found posed in the fetal position

154
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,380
右手手心朝上  左手手心朝下
With their right arm palm-up   left arm palm-down.

155
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
兇手在懺悔嗎
Remorse?

156
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,720
或者在佈置
Or staging.

157
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,220
佈置成什麼
To look like what?

158
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,920
讓她們看起來像在睡覺
Like they're asleep.

159
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
你知道原因嗎
You have any ideas why?

160
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,530
不知道
No.

161
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,630
我想  凡事都有第一次
Well   I guess there is a first time for everything.

162
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,640
Rossi  你得把我
Hey   Rossi   I'm gonna need a little bit of help

163
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,940
弄上去
getting out of this ditch.

164
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,440
Rossi
Rossi!

165
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,470
Rossi
Rossi?

166
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,310
喂
Hey--

167
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,110
算了  還是靠自己
I got it.

168
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,640
我很感激你們的到來
Listen   I appreciate you guys coming down here

169
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,080
但是我只有一具屍體
but I only got one body.

170
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,210
我們認為那是連環殺手干的
Which we believe is the work of a serial killer.

171
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,580
連環案件不應該只有一具屍體吧
Doesn't it have to be more than one to be a series?

172
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,590
如果你把比艾吉伍德稍大一點的範圍也算上的話
If you include a slightly larger area than just Edgewood

173
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,620
我們有5具屍體
We've got 5 bodies.

174
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,020
都是被勒死的  都被擺好姿勢  都被拋屍
All strangled   all staged   and all dumped.

175
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,320
為什麼是艾吉伍德
Why Edgewood?

176
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,890
因為此地對他意義非凡
It's significant to him.

177
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,400
我們認為他要麼在這堛齯j  要麼現在住在這
We believe that he either grew up here or he lives here now.

178
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
聽著  我很遺憾有人開車經過我的鎮子
Look   I'm sorry that somebody's driving through my town

179
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,630
並且拋屍  但是這不代表他就在這
and dumping bodies   but it doesn't mean he lives here.

180
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,470
我們正在HSK數據庫
We're searching for more victims

181
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,900
搜尋更多的受害者
through the HSK database.

182
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,270
那是什麼
What's that?

183
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,480
公路連環殺手數據庫
Highway Serial Killer database.

184
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,640
我們幾年前就開始
We started it a few years ago

185
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,510
追蹤全國主要高速公路附近
to track bodies found off of major highways

186
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,810
被發現的屍體
all over the country.

187
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,450
一旦法律實施   不管城鎮多小
Law enforcement   no matter how small the town

188
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,540
執法部門都會上報謀殺案件
reports the murders and

189
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,590
然後我們利用數據庫把他們關聯起來
we use the database to try to connect them.

190
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,720
不管是誰在殘害這些女性  他都不會停下來
Whoever's killing these women isn't slowing down

191
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,820
而且他很快又將把屍體扔在你家門口
and he's about to dump another body on your doorstep.

192
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,720
我的天
Oh   God.

193
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,890
我的天啊
Oh   my God.

194
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,200
住手  住手  你想怎樣
Stop! Stop! What do you want?!

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,700
我什麼都會做  告訴我你想幹什麼
I'll do anything. Just tell me what you want!

196
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,570
我想你安靜點
I want you to be quiet.

197
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,140
好  好的  我不說話
OK   ok   I'll stop.

198
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,570
還有呢
What else?

199
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,840
你還想幹什麼
What else do you want?

200
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,540
聊天
To talk.

201
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,350
好  我們聊天
OK   we can talk.

202
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,550
我們可以聊天  我想聊天
We can talk. I want to talk.

203
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,850
我想聊
I want to do that.

204
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,500
不
No...

205
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,000
這是另一個受害者的資料
Here's an M.E. File of another victim.

206
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,170
我們知道所有這些女性
We know that all these women

207
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,840
都是被同一個不明嫌犯勒死的
were strangled by the same unsub.

208
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,580
根據DNA找到了一些證據
There's evidence found by DNA

209
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,610
她們的指甲埵釭鷵搛H片
and metal fragments under their fingernails

210
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,840
但是有其他發現
but there's something else.

211
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,210
Tanya的衣服上沾有柴油
Tanya had diesel fuel on her clothing.

212
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,080
她是在高速路旁被發現的
Well   she was found off the freeway.

213
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,180
我想她們都沾有柴油
I'm sure they all had.

214
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,150
沒錯  還有糖
They all did. And sugar.

215
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,580
幾乎所有受害者衣服上都找到了食用糖
Table sugar was found on almost all the victims' clothing.

216
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,080
糖
Sugar?

217
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,850
糖能吸收柴油
It absorbs diesel fuel.

218
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,220
這是卡車司機的把戲
It's a trucker trick.

219
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,720
我們知道他是如何轉移她們的了
We know how he's transporting them.

220
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,680
我很渴
I'm thirsty.

221
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,550
求你了  我想喝水
Please   I need a drink.

222
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,590
我有問題要先問你
I have some questions first.

223
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,230
什麼都行
Anything.

224
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,060
你想知道什麼
What do you want to know?

225
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,430
這很重要
Well   it's important...

226
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,630
你要仔細聽  這點很重要
It's important that you listen.

227
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,700
明白嗎
Are we clear?

228
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,830
好的
OK.

229
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,800
你信教嗎
Are you religious?

230
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,270
什麼  你說什麼
What? I'm sorry?

231
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,980
你相信上帝嗎
Do you believe in God?

232
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,480
是的
Yeah.

233
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,420
你想要孩子嗎
Do you want children?

234
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,420
也許
Someday...

235
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,730
以後會
maybe.

236
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,110
是的  我想要孩子
Yeah   I do.

237
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,440
我想要  我想要孩子
I do. I really want kids.

238
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,410
我不相信
I don't believe you do.

239
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,720
別
No--

240
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,820
讓我出去
let me out of here!

241
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,430
Courtney  這不代表他不會邀請你去舞會
Courtney   it doesn't mean he won't invite you to the prom.

242
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,070
說真的  媽媽  你不會明白的
Seriously   mom   you just wouldn't understand.

243
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,970
你要知道我以前也上過高中
You know   I did go to high school at one time.

244
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,270
沒錯  好像是50年前的事了
Yeah   like 50 years ago.

245
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,610
我都不知道我為什麼要跟你聊這個
I don't even know why I'm talking to you about this.

246
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,770
我就當沒聽到
I'm just gonna let that one go.

247
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,580
謝天謝地
Thank goodness.

248
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,760
好的
Yeah   ok.

249
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,080
Courtney
Courtney?

250
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,090
Courtney  是你嗎
Courtney   is that you?

251
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,660
你能別晃來晃去的嗎
Hey   will you stop fooling around.

252
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,270
不
Aah! No!

253
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,750
好的
All right.

254
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,440
好的  謝謝  寶貝兒
All right   thanks   baby girl.

255
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,620
Garcia說  有782個卡車司機
Garcia says there's 782 truckers

256
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,050
在這個縣工作和居住
Working and living in this county.

257
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,420
我們需要精簡到具體的路段
We gotta narrow down the specific routes.

258
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,760
那還不夠
We'll need more than that.

259
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,190
小女孩證明
The daughter confirmed.

260
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,360
疑犯是開一輛大型越野車
Definitely driving a big rig.

261
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,360
不過她認不出標誌或者車牌
Now   she wasn't able to make out any logos or see the plate.

262
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,100
我想跟她談談
I'd like to talk to her.

263
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,570
進出縣的每條道路我都設置了檢查站
I got checkpoints at every route in and out of the county.

264
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,670
他一上路  就能發現他
If he's on the road   we'll find him.

265
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,910
他不會在休息站作案
He doesn't hunt at rest stops.

266
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,210
他剛這麼做了
He just did.

267
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,180
這堣蚢L偏僻
It's way too isolated here.

268
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,650
但是個絕佳綁架地點
It's a perfect place to take somebody.

269
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,650
對他來說不是  他喜歡罪犯友好環境
Not for this guy. He goes to offender friendly environments

270
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,750
便於融入  跟受害者交流
So he can blend in and still interact with his victims.

271
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,660
這堮琤豪S法做到
He hasn't had a chance to do that.

272
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,560
如果他是本地人  何必去休息站
Well   if he's from here   why would he need a rest stop?

273
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,640
或許為了銷毀證據
Clean up   maybe.

274
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,770
查過洗手間了嗎
You check the rest rooms yet?

275
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,570
查了  男廁的廁盆都是大便
Yeah   the sink is full of dirt in the men's room.

276
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,820
這是拋屍地點
This is a dump site.

277
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,220
不是綁架地點
It's not an abduction site.

278
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,890
他肯定在附近拋了屍
He must have dumped a body around here somewhere.

279
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,390
警長  請叫你的手下分頭找
Sheriff   I want you to have your officers spread out.

280
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,990
讓他們從溝渠找起
Tell them to start with the ditches.

281
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,470
有什麼特徵嗎  什麼都行
Any distinguishing marks? Anything at all?

282
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,010
我當時沒注意看
I wasn't looking.

283
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,810
在發短信
I was texting.

284
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,850
只聽到有輛卡車發動
I heard a truck start.

285
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,720
我進到廁所時  她已經不見了
When I went to the bathroom   she was gone.

286
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,750
你們能找到她嗎
How are you gonna find her?

287
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,660
疑犯很可能會留在本地
There's a good chance he's gonna stay here.

288
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,290
他為什麼不逃跑
Why wouldn't he just run?

289
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,030
他每次都會回到埃奇伍德
Because he always comes back to edgewood.

290
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,060
你媽媽是第一個他在本地綁架的女子
Your mother is the first woman he's taken from here.

291
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,360
我們只是開車路過
We were just driving through.

292
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,370
我們住在鳳凰城
We live in phoenix.

293
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,570
媽媽只是載我回家
Mom was just trying to get me home

294
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,140
我才能趕上選拔賽
So I could go to tryouts.

295
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,540
你們一定要找到她  她是我唯一的親人
You have to find her. She's all I have.

296
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,050
你應該去警察局
You should come down to the station.

297
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,550
抱歉
Excuse me.

298
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,780
你在哪
Hey   where are you?

299
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,980
我在南邊的樹林
I'm in the woods south of you.

300
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,850
你過來看看
You need to see this.

301
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,920
勒死  指甲縫有金屬屑
Strangled   metal shavings under her nails.

302
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,880
疑犯拋屍後
He dumps her body

303
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,180
在休息站清理
He cleans up at the rest stop

304
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,380
碰巧遇上Nancy Campbell
And then just happens to stumble onto Nancy Campbell.

305
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,550
他短時間內連續犯案
So he didn't wait a minute between victims

306
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,150
還在小孩面前作案
And he left the daughter as a witness.

307
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,990
他為何這麼做
Hey. What's going on with him?

308
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,890
這正是我們要查的
That's what we need to find out.

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
好
Ok.

310
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
最新死者比其他死者都年輕
Latest victim is younger than the others.

311
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,170
也被擺了姿勢嗎
Was she posed as well?

312
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,270
對
Yeah.

313
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,370
Nancy被綁上了新聞
Nancy Campbell's abduction hit the news.

314
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,070
希望嫌犯沒看見
Let's hope he doesn't see it.

315
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,310
他可能因此受驚而加快謀害拋屍
He could panic and then he'll dump her faster than the last one.

316
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,910
他為何拋屍不到一小時就再次犯案
Why has he dumped one victim and taken another within the hour?

317
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,950
有什麼發現  Garcia
What have you got   Garcia?

318
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,450
血腥忙碌的卡車司機
A bloody and busy trucker.

319
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,020
我查了公路連環殺手數據庫
I have been on the hsk myself.

320
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,620
查出四個相關死者
I've connected 4 more victims to this guy.

321
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,120
現在把名字發給你們
I'm sending their names to you now.

322
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,890
加起來有十個人
Brings his count to 10.

323
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,140
把Garcia確認的
We need to get photos of

324
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,530
死者照片貼到板上
the victims garcia identified up on the board.

325
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,030
只要弄清他為何選這些女子
If we figure out why he's choosing these women

326
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,430
就能找到他
We find him.

327
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,200
求求你
please!

328
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,770
求你放了我  我沒法呼吸了
Please   let me out! I can't breathe!

329
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,070
噓
Shh.

330
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,310
你為什麼這麼做
Why are you doing this?

331
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,250
閉嘴就不關燈
Keep quiet and the light stays on.

332
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,150
你想幹什麼
What--what do you want?

333
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,720
你要什麼
What do you want?

334
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,580
你
You.

335
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,890
不  求求你
No...Please...

336
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,990
求求你
Please...

337
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,720
這些是什麼
What's all this?

338
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,990
還有四名死者
There are 4 more victims?

339
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,660
他犯案期比我們想的早幾個月
He started killing months before we thought.

340
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,490
首位死者是Erika Joy
His first victim was Erika Joy

341
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,130
來自南加州  萊剋星頓
From lexington   south carolina.

342
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,200
在卡車加油站失蹤
She disappeared from a truck stop.

343
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,930
從事什麼職業
What did she do for a living?

344
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,770
根據罪檔記錄  什麼都有可能
According to her rap sheet   everyone she could.

345
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,170
這麼說是個蜥蜴
So she's a lot lizard.

346
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,570
在加油站閒逛的妓女的別稱
It's a name they give prostitutes who hang around truck stops.

347
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,670
其他死者呢
What about the others?

348
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,140
女服務員  加油站服務員  女卡車司機
Waitress   gas station attendant   female trucker.

349
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,240
有已婚的嗎
Any of them married?

350
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,940
只有最近被綁的Nancy
Just Nancy Campbell   the latest abductee

351
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,110
她是寡婦
But she's a widow.

352
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,080
她媽媽肯定
Yeah   well   her mom's gonna get

353
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,450
比這些女的
A lot more attention than...

354
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,550
更引人注意
Well   all these other women.

355
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,450
綁架Nancy風險很大
Taking Nancy Campbell was a huge risk.

356
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,480
不符他的作案手法
It doesn't fit his M.O.

357
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,090
其中必有原因
He must have had a reason.

358
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,450
我們有新消息
We just got some new information.

359
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,020
跟我來
Come with me.

360
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,030
抱歉  我稍後回來
Sorry. I'll be back in a minute.

361
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,030
他肯定得從小車旁走過
He had to have walked right by that minivan.

362
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,870
為何不綁架Courtney
Why didn't he take Courtney?

363
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,170
或者她太年輕
Maybe she's too young.

364
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,700
她比母親的年齡更接近死者
She's closer to the victims' ages than her mother.

365
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,600
停車場沒有旁人
That parking lot was deserted.

366
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,870
他大可綁架Courtney  沒人會發現
He could have taken Courtney   nobody would have seen a thing

367
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,040
相反  他從她旁邊走過
But instead   he walks past her--

368
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,940
因為她不是他的人選
Because that's not who he wants.

369
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,680
他監視Nancy
He watched Nancy.

370
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,250
跟蹤她  因為嫌犯要的就是她
He followed her because he wanted her.

371
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,820
以至於要冒險留下Courtney這個目擊者
So much so that he left Courtney as a witness?

372
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,380
是什麼那麼重要
What could be that important?

373
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,690
幾小時前  他有選擇類型
Well   until a few hours ago   he had a type.

374
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,790
其他死者都年輕  單純
The other victims were younger   less sophisticated.

375
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,520
用不了一天
It wouldn't take more than a day

376
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,260
就能知道她們是否適合
To figure out if they're worthy or not.

377
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,960
做什麼
Of what?

378
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,790
做他的伴侶
Being his companion.

379
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,400
這麼說嫌犯完全陷入幻想
Then he's completely delusional.

380
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,860
本來有很多更簡單的方式
There are easier ways to figure that out.

381
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,430
不  對這傢伙而言沒有
No   not for this guy.

382
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,770
他設定時間表迫使他一直停留在路上
He's got a schedule that forces him to stay on the road.

383
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,270
長期孤單一人
He's alone for long stretches.

384
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,970
沒有時間去求愛
He can't devote any real time to courting.

385
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,540
你認為他殺人
You really think he's killing

386
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,310
就因為他寂寞嗎
Because he's lonely?

387
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,340
我不覺得奇怪
It wouldn't surprise me.

388
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,210
煎餅好吃嗎  小公主
How are the pancakes   princess?

389
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,720
沒有你做的好吃
Not as good as yours.

390
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,790
抱歉
Excuse me.

391
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,150
爸爸  你喜歡嗎
Look   daddy. Do you like it?

392
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,390
我看看
Well   now...

393
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,490
真漂亮
Yeah   that's beautiful.

394
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,190
你爸我真的很想你
You know   your daddy really misses you.

395
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,630
能再給我講個故事嗎
Can you tell me another story?

396
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,330
好的
Ok.

397
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,200
然後
So...

398
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,270
孤獨的國王依舊沒有放棄希望
The lonely king had all but given up hope

399
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,900
他堅信自己會找到一位美麗的王后
Of ever finding the beautiful queen.

400
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,730
一瞬之間
When all of a sudden...

401
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,870
她出現了
She appeared.

402
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,450
這一次與以往不同
Now   this time it was different.

403
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,450
這一次
This time

404
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,080
他知道她就是他的真命天女
He knew she was the one.

405
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,060
這一次
This time...

406
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,130
她是那麼完美
She was perfect.

407
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,560
Courtney
Courtney?

408
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
Courtney  是你嗎
Courtney   is that you?

409
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,830
你能別晃來晃去的嗎
Hey   will you stop fooling around.

410
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,670
抱歉  親愛的  該走了
Sorry   sweetie   it's time to go.

411
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,900
一定要走嗎
Do we have to?

412
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,270
該上學了
It's time for school.

413
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,370
給
Here.

414
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,780
買根糖果棒
Why don't you go pick out a candy bar

415
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,240
當作甜點
To put in your lunch.

416
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,310
我的公主  別擔心
Oh   hey   princess   don't worry.

417
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,580
我們很快又會是一家人了
We'll be a family again real soon.

418
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,220
你不能再這麼跟她說了
You've got to stop telling her that.

419
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,760
為什麼  那是事實
Why? It's true.

420
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,120
一切都是老樣子
Nothing's changed.

421
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,230
法官不會讓她跟你一起住的
The judge isn't gonna let her live with you.

422
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,730
我在努力...
I am trying--

423
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,330
她已經被收養了
She's being placed with her adoptive family.

424
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,630
她是我的女兒
She is my daughter.

425
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,970
你們這些人不能就這麼把她帶走
You people can't just take her away.

426
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,500
你們不能這樣  我還有時間
You can't just do that! I have more time.

427
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,440
Hatchett先生  請不要這樣
Mr. Hatchett   please.

428
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,010
我希望你來見她
I wanted you to see her

429
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,250
但顯然這是個錯誤
But clearly that was a mistake.

430
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,350
幾個月前  你就已經知道
You've known for months now

431
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,180
這只是可能
That this was a possibility.

432
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,320
我會成功的
I'm gonna make this work.

433
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,850
在這個下午之前嗎
By this afternoon?

434
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,890
你照顧不了她
You can't take care of her.

435
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,160
你照顧自己都很勉強了
You can barely take care of yourself.

436
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,260
你睡在自己的卡車
You're living in your truck.

437
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,090
天天在路上跑  沒有妻子也沒有房子
You're on the road   and without a wife or a home

438
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,200
你真的做不來
You just-- you can't do it.

439
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,670
你必須要放手
You gotta let her go.

440
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,200
讓她快樂的生活
Let her be happy.

441
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,370
我知道你希望Jody快樂
I know you want that for Jody.

442
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,300
她媽媽也希望她過得好
Her mom would want what's best for her.

443
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,410
我也希望她過得好
I'm what's best for her.

444
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,810
我保證過
Look   I made a promise

445
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,680
我決不會讓她遭遇任何不幸
That I would not let anything happen to her.

446
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,650
她是我的寶貝兒
She is my little girl.

447
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,820
沒有人能像我這樣愛她
No one's gonna love her the way that I can.

448
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,680
為什麼你就是不明白呢
Why can't you understand that?

449
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
都收拾好了嗎
You all set?

450
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
我愛你  爸爸
I love you   daddy.

451
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,300
我也愛你
I love you   too.

452
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,470
皇后怎麼樣了
What about the queen?

453
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,340
她是要找的人嗎
Is she the one?

454
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,210
我不知道
I don't know.

455
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,580
故事還沒有結束  我的公主
The story's not over yet   princess.

456
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,350
Nancy Campbell已經失蹤超過12個小時
Nancy Campbell's been missing over 12 hours.

457
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,860
如果他在我們封鎖交通之前趕到了40號洲際公路
If he jumped on the I-40 before we got the police blocks out--

458
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,860
他現在可能已經在三個州以外了
He could be 3 states over by now.

459
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,330
我們認為他沒有那個時間
We don't think he has time for that.

460
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,330
他囚禁了這些女人  讓她們待在艾吉伍德
He's courting these women. He needs them in Edgewood.

461
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,660
這埵雀W過800輛卡車
There are over 800 truckers on this list.

462
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,770
要讓Garcia調查所有這些卡車的背景資料
We have to get Garcia to run background on all of them.

463
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,300
他要麼把車停在自己家
He's either parked at his own house

464
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,070
要麼就是躲在不起眼之處
Or he's hiding in plain sight.

465
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,470
我們把已經查過的停車站
Listen   I've already given you a list

466
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,210
名單都已經給你們了
Of all the trucker stops that we've checked in town.

467
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,480
我們要再查一遍
We gonna need to check them again.

468
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,520
我找你找了好久
I've searched for you for a long time.

469
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,060
你知道嗎
Did you know that?

470
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,290
你知道家庭有多重要吧
You know how important family is   don't you?

471
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,660
我知道你懂
See   I knew you would.

472
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,600
你跟其他人不一樣
You're not like the others.

473
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,030
想喝點水嗎
Oh   would you like some water?

474
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,470
不了  謝謝
No   thank you.

475
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,710
這樣可不禮貌
That's not polite.

476
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,210
我在與你分享
I'm sharing with you.

477
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,810
你應該接受
You should accept.

478
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,380
好的  謝謝  真是太好了
Yeah   please. That would be great.

479
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,080
好多了
Much better.

480
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,050
家庭就是一切
You know   family's everything.

481
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,290
有了家庭  你永遠也不會孤單
With family   you're-- you're never alone.

482
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,890
求求你
Please...

483
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,290
如果我們的女兒哭了
If our daughter were crying...

484
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,160
你會怎麼哄她
What would you do to get her to stop?

485
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,460
求求你放我走
Please let me go.

486
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,130
如果我們的女兒哭了
If our daughter were crying

487
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,500
你會怎麼哄她
What would you do to get her to stop?

488
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,140
我不知道
I don't know.

489
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,970
我會給她講個故事
I'd tell her a story.

490
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,450
我會抱著她  我不知道
I would--I'd hold her. I don't know.

491
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,080
你喜歡聽故事
You like stories?

492
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,280
我們的女兒很喜歡聽故事
Our daughter likes stories.

493
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,120
看看你  簡直是一團遭
Look at you. You're a mess.

494
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,260
我可不希望我的公主看到你
I don't want the princess to see you

495
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,960
這副髒樣子
All dirty like that.

496
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,370
我有一個女兒
I have a daughter.

497
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,310
求求你放我走
Please let me go.

498
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,510
求求你放我走
Please let me go.

499
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,050
求求你
Please!

500
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,880
求求你
please!

501
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,050
放我出去
Let me go!

502
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,850
求求你
Please...

503
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,390
求求你放我出去
Please let me go!

504
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,820
放我出去
Let me go!

505
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,620
求求你
Please...

506
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,230
-這樣就行  -謝謝
- That's fine.  - Thanks.

507
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,090
你們來是為了調查那個失蹤的女人嗎
Is this about that missing woman?

508
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,250
你知道些什麼
Do you know anything about it?

509
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,460
就是從新聞上看到的那些
Only what I saw on the news.

510
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,890
我們有理由相信嫌犯
We have reason to believe that our suspect

511
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,160
在過去的24小時內來過你這的維修站
Has been in your facility in the past 24 hours.

512
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,300
這
Here?

513
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,600
你們認為他在這
You think he's here?

514
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,170
我們需要你的幫助
We could really use your help.

515
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,700
我們可以提供入貨清單
Well   we could give you our manifest.

516
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,340
上面記錄了所有的卡車司機和貨物
It logs all the truckers and their loads.

517
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,040
那正是我們需要的
That's exactly what we need.

518
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,780
好了  起來  跟我走
All right   get up. You're coming with me.

519
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,080
我說起來
I said get up!

520
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,950
好  冷靜點
All right. Take it easy!

521
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,490
帥哥有什麼需要我幫忙的
It's your dime   Mr. Amazing.

522
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,250
這埵陵灡尾飢A縮小點範圍
Listen   I might have something to narrow your search.

523
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,920
我們認為他沒有給哪家公司打工
We don't think he drives for a company.

524
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,290
這些日程表都排得很滿
The schedules are way too tight.

525
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,820
過去幾個月  他不斷地
In the past few months   he's had the flexibility

526
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,490
綁架和殺人  肯定沒有時間同時運貨
to hunt and kill   and he couldn't do all that and run loads.

527
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,830
所以你需要我縮減範圍到
So you need me to narrow down

528
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,460
獨立承包人
The independent contractors.

529
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,660
你真是瞭解我
You're reading my mind   red.

530
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,700
我剛剛從本地車廠把所有
I just emailed you the manifest from the local depot

531
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,500
貨車司機的名單發給你了  你能不能
where all the truckers check in. Can you

532
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,600
當然可以
Of course I can.

533
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,000
有76張執照登記在個人名下
76 licenses registered under own authority

534
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,170
我都發給你了
And I just sent them back to you.

535
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,570
你真棒
Woman   you are good.

536
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,710
超乎你的想像
You have no idea.

537
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,540
你手上現在有多少件案子
So   how many of these cases have you worked on?

538
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,710
太多了
Too many.

539
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,710
那又有多少女人活著回來
How many of these women have you gotten back alive?

540
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,850
好  我們把案情重新過一遍
All right   so let's go over this again.

541
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,980
這個嫌犯專找25到30歲的
This offender's preferential

542
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,480
年輕女性下手
Young women mid- to late 20s.

543
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,920
他花很多時間跟蹤她們
He takes his time watching them.

544
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,490
確保周圍沒有目擊者
He makes sure there are no witnesses.

545
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,960
綁架過後12到24小時內殺掉她們
He kills them 12 to 24 hours after abduction.

546
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
而現在時間縮短了
Only now that timeframe's getting shorter.

547
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,530
然後他回到艾吉伍德
Then he comes home to Edgewood

548
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,660
因為這堿O他的家鄉  讓他有安全感
Where he's home and he feels safe.

549
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,160
聽著Courney  這個男人
Courtney   listen   this man

550
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,700
從不試圖去掩藏他的受害人
He doesn't try to hide his victims.

551
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,500
所以你覺得她還活著
So you think she's still alive?

552
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,300
我之前對她太無禮了
I was so rude to her.

553
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,170
我只是不想讓我對她說的最後一句話是
I just don't want the last thing I said to her to have been...

554
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,140
如果他傷害了她
If he had hurt her

555
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,240
我們現在應該已經找到她了
We would have found her already.

556
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,810
那他到底想把她怎麼樣
So what's he doing to her?

557
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,150
沒有強暴的跡象
There's no rape involved.

558
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,480
所以他只是想找個伴
So is it companionship he's after?

559
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,590
好像中世紀的騎士一樣
There might be an almost chivalrous aspect to this.

560
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,860
你怎麼知道
How do you figure?

561
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,660
卡車司機對自己的生活有種浪漫的幻想
Truckers have a romanticized image of themselves

562
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,090
實際上  當全部的生活
And in fact all lifestyles

563
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,390
都是圍繞寬廣的公路展開時  就會這樣
revolving around the open road do.

564
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,860
比如說地獄天使
The hell's angels   for instance

565
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,830
他們把綁架的女人當成自己的女朋友
They refer to their women as their old ladies

566
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,170
但事實上  他們不願保護任何人
But in fact   there's no one they'd rather protect or die for.

567
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,180
他們對待女人的方式
Their treatment of women

568
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,200
在亞瑟王的時代倒是挺合適
wouldn't be out of place in king arthur's court.

569
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,400
並且孤獨感會增進他們的幻想
And their sense of isolation would amp up their fantasy.

570
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,740
所以他是想找個老婆
So he's looking for a wife.

571
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,040
先從容易的目標下手
He starts out with easy targets

572
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
然後慢慢發展到
Then he moves on to women

573
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,570
符合他們幻想的對象
Who could actually fill the role.

574
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,340
親切  善良  熱心的
Sweet   outgoing   warm.

575
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,040
對你過多注意的調酒師
The bartender who takes extra care of you

576
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,550
搭便車的健談女人
The chatty hitchhiker.

577
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,050
但是一天之後
But over the course of the day

578
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,910
她們沒有通過測試  激怒了嫌犯
They fail the test. This infuriates him

579
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
所以嫌犯掐死她們然後棄屍
And he strangles them and dumps them.

580
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,850
如果這樣  那他為什麼要找Nancy Campbell
Ok   so why take Nancy Campbell?

581
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,720
她和其他的受害人的特徵相反
She's the opposite of all the other victims he's taken.

582
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,220
沒錯  年紀比較大  還有孩子
It's true. She's older. She already has a kid.

583
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,230
也許正因如此  所以她還活著
Maybe that's why she's still alive.

584
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,190
或許他並不是想找一個伴
What if he's not looking for a companion?

585
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,560
而是一個母親
What if he's looking for a mother?

586
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,030
如果他有個孩子
If he's got a kid of his own

587
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,900
那就知道他一直回來艾吉伍德的原因了
That would explain what keeps him coming back to edgewood.

588
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,930
也能解釋他為什麼不要Courtney
It would explain why he walks past Courtney

589
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,240
而對Nancy下手
To get to Nancy.

590
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,070
他知道她是位母親
Just by watching he knows she's a mother.

591
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,770
所以她能夠通過他的測試
She's already qualified to pass any test.

592
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,840
Garcia
Garcia.

593
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,070
長官
Sir.

594
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,040
我需要你縮小個體車主的範圍
I want you to narrow down the own authority trucker list

595
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,280
看看有誰最近剛離婚
And tell me which ones have been through a divorce recently

596
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,050
或者捲進監護權的官司
Or a custody battle.

597
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,520
監護權官司是個壓力源
Custody fight would be a stressor.

598
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,790
把你搜尋的時間定在第一個受害人之前
Limit your searches to months prior to the first murder.

599
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,020
明白了  謝謝
Got it. Thanks.

600
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,760
出什麼事了
What's going on?

601
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,960
等我一下
Just hold on a second.

602
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
等等  怎麼了
Wait   what's going on?

603
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
在40號洲際公路找到一具屍體
They found a body off the I-40.

604
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,230
沒有確定身份
No identification.

605
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,970
我媽死了嗎
Is she dead?

606
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,940
我們還不知道
We don't know.

607
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,940
什麼叫你們不知道
What do you mean you don't know?

608
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,240
警察找到了一具屍體
The police found a body

609
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,110
但不確定是不是你母親
and they aren't sure if it's your mother.

610
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,220
我想去看看
I want to go.

611
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,050
我覺得我們應該在這媯
I think we should wait here.

612
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,520
如果是她的話  我想親眼看看
I need to see if it's her.

613
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,920
Courtney  拜託  我和Reid博士會在這堻郁A
Courtney   please   Dr.Reid and I are going to stay here with you

614
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,200
一旦有消息  我們馬上就通知你
and as soon as we know anything   we will tell you.

615
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,530
可以嗎
Ok?

616
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,740
我要給Emily打電話
I'll call Emily.

617
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,740
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

618
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,570
好  謝謝
Ok   thanks.

619
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,570
那人不是你母親
It's not your mother.

620
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,440
寶貝  說吧
Hey   baby girl   talk to me.

621
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,620
76個獨立貨車司機堶
Of your 76 independent truckers

622
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,450
有28人被捲進監護權的官司
I have 28 who are currently involved in custody cases.

623
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,170
有多少還沒有宣判
How many of those cases are still open?

624
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,570
有8人
Uh   8 pending.

625
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,110
看來貨車司機不是個增進感情的工作
Not the most relationship friendly job   trucking.

626
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,740
查查那些因為母親死亡的案子
Look for instances where the mother died.

627
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,020
這樣的人不會把孩子從母親身邊搶走的
A guy like this wouldn't tear a child away from his own mother.

628
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,390
Caroline Hatchett在一場火災中身亡了
Caroline Hatchett died in a house fire

629
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,150
留下了7歲的女兒Jody
Leaving behind a 7-year-old daughter Jody

630
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,630
和丈夫Wade Hatchett
And a husband Wade Hatchett.

631
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,080
Wade失去了房子  妻子
Wade lost his home   his wife

632
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,730
還有女兒的監護權
And custody of his daughter

633
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,010
因為法庭認定他無法撫養她
When the courts deemed him unfit.

634
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,150
他還在上訴中
He's still contesting the case.

635
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,470
為什麼認為他無法撫養女兒
Why was he deemed unfit?

636
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,330
工作使得他常常一走就是幾個禮拜
Double whammy--job kept him away for weeks at a time

637
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,150
而且沒有其他親戚可以幫他帶女兒
And he didn't have any other family to help him watch the girl.

638
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,350
看起來他竭盡所能想要照顧她
Looks like he bent over backwards trying to make it work

639
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,650
但是她在學校缺席了太多堂課
But she missed a lot of school

640
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,280
所以判他忽視未成年人
And he was charged with neglect of a minor.

641
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,590
找到他的地址了嗎
You have an address?

642
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,190
只有一個用了一年多的信箱
Just a P.O. Box for over a year.

643
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,320
他女兒呢
What about the daughter?

644
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,520
Jody現在被別人撫養
Jody currently resides in foster care.

645
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,620
我現在把文件發給你
I'm sending you the file now.

646
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,120
如果這是同一個不明嫌犯所為
If this is the same unsub

647
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,760
他甚至沒有為她擺好姿勢
He didn't bother to pose her this time.

648
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,800
這次比過去殘忍多了
This is much more brutal.

649
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,830
感覺起來像是在報復
It feels personal.

650
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,660
她叫Lynn Clemons
Her name is Lynn Clemons.

651
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,770
上面100碼的地方找到她的錢包
Deputies found her wallet about 100 yards up.

652
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,440
肯定是棄屍的時候調出來了
Must have spilled out when he dumped her.

653
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,800
Garcia  幫我查出有關
Garcia   we need everything that you have

654
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,810
Lynn Clemons的一切
on a Lynn Clemons.

655
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,440
Lynn Clemons  她是
Lynn Clemons? She's the...

656
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,640
她是Jody的養父母
Foster parent of Jody Hatchett.

657
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,110
我才剛告訴其他人
I was just telling the others

658
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,080
她的父親是個失去監護權的貨車司機
Her father is a trucker who lost custody

659
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,380
他失去了監護權
When his wife died.

660
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,680
而Jody就要被收養
Jody's in the process of being adopted.

661
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,020
他快沒時間了
He ran out of time.

662
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,850
派人去他家了嗎
Is the team on their way to his house?

663
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,950
沒有  他只有個郵政信箱
No   he only has a P.O. Box.

664
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,050
他殺了孩子的養母
He killed the foster parent.

665
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,790
肯定要去找他女兒
He's going after his daughter.

666
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,760
Garcia  Jody Hatchett現在哪
Garcia   where's Jody Hatchett right now?

667
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,330
等一下
Wait!

668
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,710
嗨  Jody
Hey   Jody.

669
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,760
你是誰
Who are you?

670
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,350
我是Emily
I'm Emily.

671
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,030
Clemons太太呢
Where's Mrs. Clemons?

672
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,850
我們進去再說好嗎
Well   I'll tell you inside   ok?

673
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,460
沒事的  來吧
It's ok. Come on.

674
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,470
Jody
Jody.

675
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,460
怎麼回事
What's going on?

676
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,910
我們在協助警方  尋找你的父親
We're helping the police   and we're trying to find your dad.

677
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,480
你知道他在哪兒嗎
Do you know where he is?

678
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,940
不知道
No.

679
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,150
Hotch  有輛卡車開過來了
Hotch   truck's coming up the road right now.

680
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,920
Jody  我們能去你房間玩嗎
Hey   Jody   can we go play in your room?

681
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,760
這邊
It's right here.

682
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,030
好
Ok.

683
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,820
好了
All right.

684
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,320
快起來
Get up.

685
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,800
有人進了前駕駛室
Somebody's moving toward the front of the cab.

686
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,270
那是Nancy Campbell
All right   it's Nancy Campbell.

687
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,840
他在她身後  用槍指著她
He's behind her and he's got his gun on her.

688
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,010
Morgan  能射中他嗎
Morgan   do you have a shot?

689
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,610
不行
Negative. Negative.

690
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,920
他把她作為擋箭牌
He's using her as a shield.

691
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
為了找回他女兒  他可能會殺了Nancy
Hotch   he might kill Nancy to get to Jody.

692
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,280
這些都是你畫的嗎
Did you paint all of these yourself?

693
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,420
感覺像是  她們在睡覺嗎
It looks like they're... Sleeping?

694
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,130
國王替她們蓋好被子  就像我爸爸那樣
Yeah. The king tucks them in   just like my daddy does for me.

695
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,630
這個是你媽媽嗎
Is this your mom here   this one?

696
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,330
不  這是王后
No. That's the queen.

697
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,130
誰是王后
Who's that?

698
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,100
國王想帶她回城堡
She's the one that the king tried to take home

699
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,540
但沒能成功
to the castle   but she didn't make it.

700
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,540
她怎麼了
What happened her?

701

她的馬車壞了
Her carriage broke down

702
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,880
為了救公主  國王不得不留下她
And he had to leave her behind to save the princess.

703
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,350
有很多王后啊
There's a lot of queens here.

704

長得都不一樣
They all look different.

705
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,520
是啊
They are.

706
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,990
這個王后怎麼樣了
What happened to this one here?

707
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,150
她太髒了
She was dirty.

708
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,590
國王說
The king said   "How do you expect

709
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,790
她連自己都照顧不好
"To give my daughter a bath

710
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,630
又怎麼來照顧公主呢
If you can't even take one yourself?"

這故事我很喜歡
I like that story.

這些故事都是你自己編的嗎
Do you make up all these stories?

713
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,030
不是  是我爸爸說給我聽的
No. My daddy does.

714
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,700
我喜歡把它們畫出來
I like painting them.

715
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,840
這個故事還沒結束吧
Well   this story isn't over yet   is it?

716
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,470
爸爸也這麼說
That's what my dad said.

717
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,180
是嗎
He did?

718
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,710
我們今天一起吃烤薄煎餅時
Today we were eating pancakes

719
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,280
他說她很完美
And he said she was perfect.

720
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,210
你想見見王后嗎

724
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,050
我找不到她  他們把她怎麼樣了
I don't see her. What did they do with her?

725
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,720
Jody多大了
How old is Jody?

726
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,380
她會喜歡我嗎
Do you think she'll like me?

727
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,550
爸爸  你在嗎

728

你得把故事說完
You need to tell me the rest of the story.

730
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,900
孤獨的國王和王后正在城堡

732

現在不行  有守衛在
No   the guards are in the way.

733
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,110
讓王后和他們談談吧
Will you let the queen talk to them?

734
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,270
他們不會聽
They won't listen.

735

但我想見她
But I want to see her.

736

Hatchett

756
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,950
轉過身來
Turn around.

757
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,760
克奡策咱情P拉什說道[著名美國史學家]
Christopher Lasch said

758
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,730
現實生活鐵石心腸  唯有家庭宛如天堂
"Family is a haven in a heartless world."

759
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,440
你在看什麼
What you reading?

760
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,980
公路連環殺手數據庫
The HSK database.

761
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,710
此時此刻  這其中可能有半打人
Do you know there's probably half a dozen serial killers

762
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,680
正在駕車四處殺人
driving around right now?

763
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,550
是什麼讓你耿耿於懷
What's really bothering you?

764
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,790
Jody失去了母親
Jody lost her mom

765
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,760
又失去了父親
and then her dad

766
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,260
現在肯定沒人敢領養她了
And the couple that was gonna adopt her backed out.

767
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,090
新聞堥麭B都是
It's all over the news.

768
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,200
我只是覺得
It's just...

769
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,770
這不公平
It's just not fair.

770
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,270
她的阿姨得知此事
Her aunt saw the story.

771
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,280
她站了出來
She came forward.

772
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,010
過去幾年她和Jody的媽媽
She'd lost touch with Jody's mom

773
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,320
失去了聯繫  現在是她唯一在世的親屬
over the past few years   but she's her only living relative

774
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,160
她願意撫養Jody
And she wants to raise Jody.

775
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
是嗎
Really?

776
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,370
要知道  Prentiss
You know   Prentiss

777
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,230
我一想起每天經歷的這些
When I think about the things we see on a daily basis

778
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,740
所有的邪惡面
All the bad

779
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,840
而我依然驚嘆於善的力量
I'm still amazed at all the good.

780
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,580
是啊  但是
Yeah   but...

781
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,250
你覺得善與惡的勢力均衡嗎
Do you think it evens out?

782
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,880
但願如此
I'd like to think it does.
