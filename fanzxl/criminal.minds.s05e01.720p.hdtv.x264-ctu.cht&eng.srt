If you stop hunting me, i'll stop hunting them.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,320

12
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,900

We're not working a case. Why call us to a crime scene?

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,960
我還以為你知道原因
I was hoping you knew.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,590
JJ說警方告知她案子非常緊急
Jj said the police told her it was urgent.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,530

被槍口頂著退到房間 胸部中槍
was forced into the apartment at gunpoint and then shot in the chest.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,310
現場處理得很草率
It was all pretty sloppy.

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,020
無意冒犯 但我不明白找我們幹嘛

It said the person was planning to kill his son.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,060
如果Barton醫生企圖將兒子藏起來 每天將有一個人在其住所身亡
If dr. Barton tried to keep his boy hidden, one person would die every day in his place.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,470

留言署名是LC

Now,unless dr. Barton puts his son in harm's way, we're going to keep having a victim a day.

Barton醫生現在在哪兒?

40
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,350
Hotch呢? 他沒接電話 可能是調成振動了
Where's hotch? He's not answering his cell. I assume it's on vibrate.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,350
他醒來後會收到信息的
He'll get the message when he wakes up.

42

我說我在醫院收到恐嚇
I told him that there was a threat against me at the hospital.

51
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,060
我說這並未引起警方重視 但他們希望我在家待幾天
I told him the police didn't take it seriously but that they wanted me to stay here for a few days

52
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,420
所以我想讓他陪著我

她在他10歲時去世了 乳癌

55
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,300
真會有人傷害Jeffrey嗎?

56
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,120
已有兩人遇害 送留言的人絕非戲言
2 people are dead already. Whoever sent that note is obviously serious.

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,180
如果我不讓Jeffrey離開房子 就會再有人遇害?
And if I don't let jeffrey out of the house, then another person's gonna die?

58
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,990
眼下我們不得不認為他會繼續殺戮
Right now we have to assume that he will keep killing.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,150
我兒子才15歲 我明白
My son is 15 years old. I understand.

60
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,820
我不能讓他置身危險
I cannot put him in danger.

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,560
我們沒讓你這麼做
We are not asking you to.

62
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,740
而且即使你願意
And even if you were willing,

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,690
我們也不會明知他會危及他人 還把他送去學校的
we couldn't send him to school knowing he would endanger every student in the building.

64
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,700
我們現在要做的是 仔細核查一切已知信息
What we need to do now is go over everything we know,

65

Well,iiI can't think of anyone who would want to kill jeffrey.

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,240
不論是誰寫的 他都是衝你來的 這是私人恩怨
Whoever wrote that note was putting you on noticethis is personal.

68
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,430
他希望你記起他是誰 而在此之前
He wants you to remember who he is, and until that happens,

69
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,550
他是不會善罷甘休的
he hasn't accomplished what he set out to do.

我知道你已經回答過了 但請你再想想

我給Garcia打電話
I'll call garcia.

83
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,040
我不明白 如果他是衝我來的 為什麼不直接來殺我?
Ii don't understand. If he's mad at me, why not just kill me?

84
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,770
JJ 有Hotch的回音嗎?

128
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,330
知道嗎 別看你是聰明孩子 也還是會問一堆傻問題
You know,for a smart boy, you still ask a lot of dumb questions.

129
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,060
幾秒鐘後發給你 嘿 Garcia
You'll have them in seconds. Hey,garcia.

130
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,180
在呢 我的寶貝
Yes,my love.

131
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,260
Hotch聯繫你了嗎?
Has hotch checked in with you?

132
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,550
他不和你們在一塊兒? 也許在來的路上吧
He's not with you? He's probably on his way.

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,380
謝謝你 拜
Uh,thanks for everything. Bye.

134
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,990
她會把文件發給我們 我們可以在這兒打印出來
She's going to email the files. We'll print them out from here.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
我可以要辦公室把文件送來
I could have my office send over the files.

136
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,530
不 不用 相信我們 這樣更快
No,no,trust us, this is faster.

137
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,280
我們要挖掘你生活的每個細節 找出這件事的起因
We need to dig through your life and try to figure out why this is happening.

138
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,930
我們從最近的病例著手查起
Let's start with the most recent cases first,

139
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,100
惹惱這傢伙的導火索 很可能就在文件
something set this guy off,and odds are it's in your files.

140
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,280
我得通知所有家長
I need to notify all the parents.

141
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,590
我們認為那不明智
We think that's a mistake.

142
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,150
我要對這些孩子的安全負責 正是
I'm in charge of keeping these kids safe. Exactly.

143
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,960
等到公車和家長來接這些孩子 學校會很自然地放學關門
And there's a natural end to this day, when buses and parents come to pick these kids up.

144
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,720
不論他是誰 絕不是高效的射手
Whoever's doing this is not an effectual shooter.

145
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,010
他行兇時很草率
His killings are sloppy.

146
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,790
所以萬一引起恐慌 很多人可能會在對峙時受傷
So if there's a panic, a lot of people could be caught in the crossfire.

147
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,440
你們就不能帶Jeffrey回家嗎?
Can't you just take jeffrey home?

148
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,880
如我們這麼做 被嫌犯看到 其他人就會被害
If we do that and the unsub is watching, someone else is gonna be killed.

149
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,870
那怎麼辦?
Then what?

150
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,480
我們會封鎖除前門外的所有進出口
We lock up every filter point except the front door.

151
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,240
沒人能進來 就說這是學校規定 不容質疑
Nobody comes in. We say it's school policy. No questions.

152
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,940
有人要見學生 我們就帶孩子去見他
And if someone needs to see a student, we bring the kids to them.

153
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,780
我需要一份校內目前 所有人員名單和員工資料
I'll need a complete list and employment records of everyone already inside the building.

154
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,210
我會帶保安作好佈置 守住所有出口
I'll brief your security guards and take care of all of the exits.

155
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,990
然後你要分小組召集教職員 帶他們來見我
After that,i need you to gather the faculty into small groups and bring them to me.

156
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,850
就當例行公事
Treat it as routine.

157
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,300
還有 你要盡可能自然地 把Jeffrey從教室叫出來
And in the meantime, I need you to get jeffrey out of class as casually as possible.

158
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,110
你能做到嗎?
Can you do that?

159
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,390
Jeffrey Barton 跟我出來一下
Jeffrey barton. Can I see you for a moment?

160
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,280
嘿 Jeffrey 我叫Derek Morgan 是FBI
Hey,jeffrey. My name's derek morgan. I'm with the fbi.

161
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,310
我看到你在我家客廳
I saw you in my living room.

162
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,750
聽著 我首先想知道 你有把這件事告訴其他人嗎?
Listen,the first thing I need to know is if you've told anyone about what's happening?

163
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,570
沒有
No.

164
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,230
回教室去 不得閒逛
Back to class. No loitering.

165
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,420
Jeffrey 你確定?
Jeffrey,you're sure?

166
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,510
因為即使一條短信 都會讓這個地方雞犬不寧
Because even just one text message could set this place off.

167
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,520
我確定
I'm sure.

168
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,270
很好 我們會保證你安全的 孩子
All right,that's good. We're gonna keep you safe,kid.

169
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,700
但首先 你要保持冷靜
But in order to do that, you're gonna have to stay calm.

170
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,320
你還必須得相信我 明白嗎?
And you're also gonna have to trust me. You understand?

171
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,820
每次你邁出教室 我都會在這
Every time you step out of class, I will be right here.

172
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,290
就像某個和Findlay校長在走廊的人
Now,it's gonna look like i'm just another adult in the hallway with principal findlay,

173
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,090
但我會看著你
but I got your back.

174
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,550
我爸爸還好嗎?
Is my dad ok?

175
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,560
他知道你想做正確的事
He knows you were just trying to do the right thing.

176
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,770
他只想把你安全帶回家
He just wants to get you home safe.

177
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,800
你認為有人想殺死我去報復他?
Do you think somebody's trying to kill me to get back at him?

178
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,630
有這種可能
It is possible.

179
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,430
知道原因嗎?
Do you know why?

180
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,090
這正是我們想搞明白的
That's what we need to figure out.

181
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,000
咱精力集中看看留言
Let's concentrate on the note.

182
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,230
首先 我們知道他是名男性
For starters, we know that he's male.

183
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,720
你怎麼能肯定?
How can you be sure?

184
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,360
女性會在留言堨[入形容詞 和描述細節的內容
Women tend to add adjectives and very specific details to their notes.

185
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,860
這個沒有這類現象
This has none of those.

186
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,140
男性通常比較直接 第一句"我打算殺死你兒子"
Males are also more direct. First sentence"i plan to kill your son."

187
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,350
他們的留言更多以自己為中心 而不是他們的留言對像
and their notes tend to be more about themselves than the person they're writing to.

188
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,460
"我每天都在看著你" "我要親眼看你失去一切"
"i watched you every day." "i will watch you lose everything."

189
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,260
我們知道 他在監視你和你兒子
we know he surveilled you and your son,

190
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,130
也就是說 他要麼很富有不用上班 要麼就正處於失業狀態
which means he either has enough money to be away from a regular job or he's currently unemployed.

191
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,960
他很可能是位父親 顯然他很悲傷
He's most likely a father. He's clearly grieving.

192
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,670
他要採取非常手段讓你"感同身受"
He's taken great measures to make sure you feel his pain.

193
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,210
先從涉及青少年死亡的病例入手 還有所有家人情緒激動的
Let's start with cases involving teenagers killed, but also anyone with a strong family presence.

194
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,210
你兒子15歲 不表示他孩子一定同歲
Just because your son is 15, that doesn't necessarily mean that his child is the same age.

195
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,730
你們是不是接觸過很多這種案子 別人威脅要對你下手的案子?
Have you had a lot of cases like this, where someone taunts you with what they're gonna do?

196
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,770
一些
A few.

197
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,620
結果都是怎樣?
And how did they end?

198
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,150
求你了
Please.

199
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,770
借警察之手自殺似乎是 他們求得認可和結束所有痛苦
Suicide by cop seems to be an effective way for them to make their point,

200
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,890
最行之有效的辦法
while ending their suffering all at once.

201
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,140
Jeffrey再過5小時就放學了
Jeffrey is leaving school in 5 hours.

202
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,590
我們沒辦法在這麼短時間內 看完所有的病人資料
There's no way we can get through all these patients in this time.

203
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,510
起碼我們已經縮小範圍了
Well,now,we've narrowed it down already.

204
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,000
但我們還有100個
And we still have 100 left.

205
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,530
抱歉 不是我無情 但在急診室工作 根本記不住病人的名字
I'm sorry,i don't mean to be callous, but when you work in the e.R.,you don't remember names.

206
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,620
做完一個手術 然後做下一個
You operate and you move on.

207
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,030
他說的對 就這麼點時間 要側寫的東西太多了
He's right. There are too many files here for us to profile in such a short period of time.

208
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,740
呃 我可以去趟Hotch家 半小時能回來
Um,i can get to hotch's and get back here in half an hour.

209
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,380
他是誰? 是我們的老大
Who's that? He's our supervisor.

210
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,690
我們今天本來休息的
We weren't supposed to work today.

211
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,520
聯繫不到他
We're having trouble getting ahold of him.

212
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,500
但我們需要更多人手
But we need more eyes.

213
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,850
留言上沒說今天殺死Jeffrey 寫著
The note doesn't say that he'll kill jeffrey today, it says,

214
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,540
"不是今天 就是明天或後天"
"if not today, tomorrow or the next day."

215
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,110
就算他今天能安全回家
let's say he gets home safe.

216
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,640
你們又能在這守護他多久?
How long will you all be around to make sure he's ok?

217
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,020
我們度過今天再說吧
Let's just get through today.

218
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,010
Hotch? 是我 Emily
Hotch? It's meemily.

219
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,950
加班時間 我是Penelope
Overtime shift. Penelope speaking.

220
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,040
Garcia 是Emily 你認真的聽著
Garcia,it's emily. I need you to listen really carefully.

221
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,050
Hotch出事了
Something's happened to hotch.

222
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,510
什麼意思? 出事了?
What do you mean,something?

223
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,500
我不知道 我在他家 他不在 而且地上有血跡
I don't know. I'm in his place. He's not here, but there's blood.

224
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,520
噢 天哪
Oh,my god.

225
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,100
我要你馬上派警察 和FBI技術人員來這
I need you to send police and fbi techs here right away.

226
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,230
有空的都叫過來
Everyone available.

227
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,250
要發全境通告嗎?
Uh,do we need an apb?

228
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,910
通告找Hotch就行 我看過前門 他的車還在
Only on hotch. I checked out front. His car's still here.

229
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,430
他被人綁架了? 我不知道
Someone took him? I don't know.

230
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,180
這埵釵撣 但我不確定是誰的
There's blood,but I can't be sure whose it is.

231
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,470
派人過來就對了
Just get people here.

232
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,640
好的 我會派支軍隊過去
Ok,i'm sending an army.

233
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,970
Garcia Reid在等我回去 我會告訴他 但是你不能告訴其他人
Garcia,i'm gonna have to tell reid because he's expecting me back, but you can't tell the others.

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,870
他們不能分心 好的 好的
They cannot be distracted. Ok. Ok.

235
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,830
什麼? 你 你說什麼?
What? Whatwhat are you talking about?

236
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,370
怎麼回事? 有關Jeffrey的?
What's going on? Is this about jeffrey?

237
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,080
不 不 不相關的
No,no,it's unrelated.

238
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,730
我們沒剩下幾個小時了
We only have a few hours left here.

239
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,910
真的很抱歉 我必須接這通電話 好嗎?
I'm really sorry, I have to take this phone call,ok?

240
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,600
現在還有什麼事比我兒子更重要?
What could be more important than my son right now?

241
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,480
我保證 一會就好 拜託了 我發誓
I assure you, this will take one second. Please,i promise.

242
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,360
好吧
Fine.

243
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,890
牆上有一個大洞
There's a huge hole in the wall.

244
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,150
很可能是點44口徑 但洞周圍沒有帶血組織
Ab a .44, but there's no blood fineor tissue spray around it.

245
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,640
知道他怎麼出去的嗎?
Any idea how he got out?

246
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,850
他中槍的話 地上沒有拖曳痕跡
If he was shot, there are no drag marks.

247
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,600
但是可以用東西把人包起來
But a body could have been wrapped in something.

248
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,080
局堛漣瑋N人員趕去了嗎?
And bureau techs are on the way?

249
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,140
隨時會到
Any second.

250
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,170
好吧 把你看到的都寫下來 回去後我們再分析你的記錄
All right,um,write down everything you see and we'll profile from your notes when you get back.

251
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,010
Barton醫生怎麼樣了?
How's dr. Barton?

252
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,890
這埵酗@大堆案例要看過
It's a huge list of cases to go through with him.

253
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,060
好吧 別擔心這 有我在 你集中注意力
Ok,don't worry about here. I've got this. Just stay focused.

254
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,060
好的 你也是
All right. You,too.

255
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,780
Barton醫生? 很抱歉
Uh,dr. Barton? Sorry about that.

256
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,020
Prentiss探員被緊急調走了
Agent prentiss has been called away on an emergency.

257
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,060
開什麼玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

258
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,970
我相信我們兩人能行的 好嗎?
I'm confident that the two of us can do this together right now. All right?

259
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,820
他殺害西班牙男性作為替代品
We know he's been killing hispanic males as surrogates.

260
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,700
你病例分類做好了嗎? 是的
Did you separate the case files? Yeah.

261
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,810
有多少個手術符合條件?
All right,how many of the surgeries fit the criteria?

262
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,760
82個
Um,82.

263
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,060
好吧 我問你
all right. Now let me ask you this.

264
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,850
那些手術的當天 你還做了其他手術的有幾個?
On how many of those dates did you operate on somebody else as well?

265
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,930
75個
75.

266
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,520
有病人死在手術台上嗎?
did any of those patients die on the table?

267
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,240
10個 不 等等 11個
10. um,no,wait. 11.

268
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,520
11個 我們就從這媔}始 這整件事和選擇有關
11. that's where we start. This whole thing is about choice.

269
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,270
他用兒子來要挾你做抉擇 因為上一次選擇擺在你面前
He's forcing you to play god with your son because the last time you had a choice,

270
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,210
你的決定毀了他
your decision devastated him.

271
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,860
我是個醫生 救死扶傷而已
I'm a doctor. I save people.

272
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,050
他不關心這個
It doesn't matter to him.

273
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,920
他關心的只是你沒選擇另一個人
All that matters to him is that you had an alternative and you didn't take it.

274
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,300
哪些手術中有20歲以下的病人?
Now,how many of those surgeries involve patients under 20?

275
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,130
6個 總有槍傷病人送來 大部分都是幫派人物
6. we get a lot of shootings, mostly gang related.

276
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,520
有哪個混混或家人威脅過你?
Has a gang member or family member ever threatened you?

277
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,070
沒有 失去親人時 首先感到不知所措和崩潰
No,uh,at first when you lose someone it's mostly confusion and devastation.

278
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,230
其後才是憤怒
The anger comes later.

279
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,870
有六天給西班牙男性做手術
All right,we have 6 dates where you operated on an hispanic male

280
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,200
且同一晚 有20歲不到的病人去世
on the same night a patient under 20 died.

281
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,640
我要把這些姓名和日期讀給你聽
What i'm gonna do is i'm gonna read the names and dates

282
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,850
把你能記得的都告訴我 好嗎?
and you tell me anything you can remember,ok?

283
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,850
好的
Ok.

284
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,260
好吧 我們從1月22日開始
All right,let's start with january 22nd.

285
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,460
Tyler Hayes 多處槍傷
Tyler hayes, multiple gunshot wounds.

286
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,310
2月13日 Brian Douglas 肇事逃逸受害者 主動脈撕裂
February 13th, brian douglas, hitandrun victim, lacerated aorta.

287
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,940
不是 3月15日 Devon Marks 吸毒過量
No. March 15th, devon marks, heroin overdose.

288
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,910
Angela Harris 也是車禍 腦溢血死亡
Angela harris, another car accident, single vehicle, bleeding into her brain.

289
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,920
我...這沒用 如果被威脅過 我會記得的
I... This is no use. I would remember if I was threatened.

290
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,410
有人問起過你的家庭嗎?
Did any of them ask you about your family?

291
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,120
我們還有時間
We have time.

292
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,820
好吧
Ok.

293
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,550
我和Walker探員談過 3:10放學
I talked to detective walker. Final bell's at 3:10.

294
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,340
3點整他會帶一隊特警就位 護送學生出校
he's gonna have a s.W.A.T.Unit in place at exactly 3:00 to escort kids out.

295
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,850
我們需要你在2:45集合學生
We'll need you to gather the students at 2:45.

296
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,180
現在就可以
this could all be happening now.

297
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,000
如果不明嫌犯看見我們提早疏散 他肯定會去殺害另一個市民
If the unsub sees us evacuate early, we feel certain he'll kill another random citizen.

298
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,660
我們這一天的努力就白費了
And this also buys us a day to try and discover his identity.

299
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,960
所以我們用校車來疏散
So we'll have school buses for evacuation.

300
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,260
老師可以通知來接孩子的家長
Teachers can brief parents who are here to pick up their kids.

301
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,410
關鍵是把Jeffrey隔離開 避免造成他人恐慌
The key is to keep jeffrey isolated and avoid panic with the other students.

302
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,050
做到的話 大家都能平安離開
If we can do that, everybody gets out of here safe.

303
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,470
你交叉核查過這堛漱u作人員 是否和Barton有過節嗎?
Have you crosschecked all the records of employees in the building against dr. Barton?

304
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,080

Garcia's on it.

305
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,900
Emily 不是

308
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,680
你查完工作人員的背景資料了嗎?
Did you finish the background check on everyone in the building?

309
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,550
是的 沒危險人物 沒重罪犯 沒和Barton有關係的
Yeah. Uh,no red flags, no felonies, no connection to barton.

310
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,090
好的 這就好
Ok,well,that's good.

311
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,870
好了 聽著 我得掛了 要響鈴了
All right,listen,i gotta go. There's about to be a bell.

312
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,490
好的 注意安全
All right. Be safe.

313
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,430
一切都還好吧? 是的 噢 是的 我只是累了
Everything ok? Yeah. Oh,yeah, i'm just tired.

314
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,430
嗯 知道 把這孩子安全帶回家 我們就都能睡覺了
Yeah,i hear you. Let's just get this kid home safe and we can all sleep.

315
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,420
好的
Right.

316
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,140
打擾下
Excuse me.

317
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,160
我是來見Findlay校長的
I'm supposed to meet with principal findlay.

318
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,930
能告訴我她辦公室在哪媔?
Can you tell me where her office is?

319
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,760
喬治城醫院
Georgetown hospital.

320
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,780
你好 我是Penelope Garcia  FBI
My name's penelope garcia. I'm from the fbi.

321
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,350
有沒有名叫Aaron Hotchner的探員 送到你們急診室?
I was calling to see if an agent aaron hotchner had been admitted to the emergency room?

322
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,440
特別督察探員Aaron Hotchner
Supervisory special agent aaron hotchner.

323
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,070
Hotchner...Aaron
Hotchner,aaron.

324
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,990
我想知道他是否被送到急診室或...
I wanted to see if he had been admitted or if...

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
是 他是FBI探員
Yeah,he's an fbi agent.

326
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,470
什麼時候?
What... When was that?

327
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,760
好的 謝謝
Ok. Thank you.

328
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,670
天哪
Oh,my god.

329
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,040
說吧 Garcia
Talk to me,garcia.

330
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,300
我打給各家醫院 看Hotch是否進了急診室
Ok,ii called hospitals to see if hotch had gotten himself admitted to an emergency room.

331
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,770
然後? 病人名單上沒有 但有人把一無名傷者 送到聖塞巴斯蒂安醫院
And? He's not listed as a patient, but someone dropped a john doe off at st.Sebastian hospital,

332
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,880
那人名為FBI探員Derek Morgan
and that someone's name was fbi agent derek morgan.

333
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,410
這不可能啊 我知道 會不會他們把證件弄混了?
It doesn't make sense. I know. Do you think they got their credentials mixed up?

334
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,390
是惡魔獵手
The reaper.

335
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,130
Foyet拿走了Morgan的證件
Foyet took morgan's creds.

336
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,840
那為什麼送他去急診室?
Why would he drop him off at the e.R.?

337
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,400
你剛剛說哪家醫院?
What hospital did you say again?

338
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,630
聖塞巴斯蒂安醫院
St.Sebastian hospital.

339
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,320
我到了再打給你 好
I'll call you with an update when I get there. Yeah.

340
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,870
我不明白 這些手術相隔幾個小時
I don't understand. These surgeries are all hours apart.

341
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,390
我沒有在病患中做選擇
I didn't have to choose between patients.

342
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,700
如果兇手是因為我的選擇而報復 這堶惜ㄦ|有符合的
If he's punishing me for my choices, none of these fit.

343
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,980
再看看字條 和病例的措辭比照一下
All right, look at the note again and compare against the wording on the charts.

344
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,010
通常嫌犯會不自覺的通過措辭 再現當時的情況
A lot of times an unsub will unconsciously mirror the wording of situations.

345
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,600
想起什麼嗎?
You remember something?

346
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,510
我不確定 那時新年剛過
Uh,i don't know. It was right after new year's.

347
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,490
有場車禍 其中一名傷者是西班牙人
There was a car accident. One of the victims was hispanic.

348
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,640
新年...
New year's...

349
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,140
1月3日 兩車相撞 你給Hector Ledezma做了手術
January 3rd, there's a 2car collision, you operated on a hector ledezma.

350
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,250
那天晚上你只有這一個手術
That was your only surgery that night.

351
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,810
Ledezma太太?
Mrs. Ledezma?

352
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,730
撞擊導致病人腎臟破裂 大量失血
The collision lacerated his kidney. He lost a lot of blood.

353
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,260
但我們修補了破裂處
But we were able to repair the damage.

354
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,260
過段時間 他會康復的
So,it'll take some time, but he'll be just fine.

355
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,100
那我兒子呢? 抱歉?
What about my son? I'm sorry?

356
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,910
Jason Meyers 18歲 也是車禍受害者
Jason meyers. He's 18. he was in the accident.

357
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,890
你兒子送來醫院時已經死了
Your son was dead when he arrived here.

358
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,700
原來是因為我沒給那孩子做手術
That's because I dt operate on the boy.

359
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,830
他們告訴我他還有呼吸
They told me he's breathing.

360
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,260
那是給他帶了生命維持設備 但...
He's been put on life support. But,um...

361
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,160
但是他已腦死亡 我很抱歉
I'm afraid he no longer has brain function. I'm very sorry.

362
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,830
你根本沒想給他手術 已經太遲了
You're not even gonna operate. It's too late.

363
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,760
你根本不知道他是誰 還要看病例
You don't even know who he was. She had to give you the chart.

364
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,150
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,370
你有孩子嗎? 有個兒子
Do you have children? A son.

366
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,940
如果一個醫生拒絕救你兒子 你會對他說什麼?
What would you say to a doctor who wouldn't even try to save him?

367
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,750
很抱歉 我知道這難以接受 但我真的無能為力
I'm sorry. I know it's hard to understand, believe me, but there is nothing I can do.

368
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,610
Garcia 搜索一名叫Jason Meyers的病患
Garcia,i need you to find a patient in the system named jason meyers.

369

371
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,450
3天前他被撤掉呼吸機並正式宣佈死亡
He was taken off the ventilator and declared legally dead 3 days ago.

372
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,620
他爸爸是誰?
Who's his father?

373
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,470
Patrick Meyers 45歲
Yeah,uh,patrick meyers, age 45.

374
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,960

He was stabbed 9 times, but no major arteries were hit.

377
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,210
他能活命簡直是奇跡
It's a miracle he's alive.

378
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,820
他什麼時候能醒?

379
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,330
麻醉1小時內消退
The anesthesia should wear off within the hour.

380
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,710
到時就會醒了 好的
But he's bound to be out of it. Ok.

381
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,500
我可以留在這嗎? 當然
May I stay here? Of course.

382
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,240
謝謝
Thank you.

383
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,250
別擔心
Don't worry.

384
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,640
大樓疏散後 就能護送你回家了
As soon as the building's clear, you're gonna get your own escort out of here.

385
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,860
別擠 一個一個來
Come on,no pushing. One at a time.

386
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,480
別停下 排好順序
Let's keep it moving. Nice and orderly.

387
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,940
這個縮寫L.C.什麼意思?
This abbreviation right here,l.C., what does that stand for?

388
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,710
你去哪?
Where are you going?

389
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,910
字條說要我按習慣行事 我歇班時都去接Jeffrey放學
The note says not to deviate from my routine, and I always pick up jeffrey on my days off.

390
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,970
我和你一起去
I'm gonna come with you.

391
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:17,860
說吧
Yeah.

392
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,360
嫌犯字條上的L.C.是指 "活著的孩子"
L.C.On the unsub's note. It stands for "living children."

393
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,180
你確定? 這是醫院管理用的
are you sure? It's administrative.

394
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,040
如果傷患需要生命維持設備 又沒有 簽署放棄搶救協議 就會標上
It's when they're afraid a patient's gonna go on life support and they don't have a dnr order.

395
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,910
Reid?
Reid?

396
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,360
嫌犯會不會是說Barton醫生才是目標?
What if the unsub was trying to tell dr. Barton that he is actually the target

397
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,470
他的兒子將失去父親?
and that he's gonna leave his son without a father?

398
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,120
Barton!
Barton!

399
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,280
醫生!
Doctor!

400
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,090
Reid? 回答我 Reid?
Reid? Answer me. Reid?

401
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,380
我是FBI特別探員Emily Prentiss
This is special agent emily prentiss from the fbi.

402
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,510
馬上派警察和救護車到弗吉尼亞州 麥克林 肯辛通路120號
I need police and an ambulance to 120 kensington road, mclean,virginia.

403
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,930
發生槍擊 探員可能受傷
Shots fired, federal agent possibly down.

404
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,620
你中槍了嗎? 沒有
Are you hit? No.

405
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,670
把槍拿過來 槍
Get my gun. My gun.

406
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,640
快離開他! 離開他!
Get away from him! Get away from him.

407
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,700
一定要趴下 不要保護他
Whatever you do,stay down. Don't protect him.

408
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,590
放下槍!
Drop the gun!

409
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,720
他殺了我兒子! 他沒殺你兒子!
He killed my son! He did not kill your son.

410
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,180
你兒子死於車禍 站起來!
Your son was killed by a car accident. Stand up!

411
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,600
再說一次 我不想對你開槍 快放下槍
I'm gonna ask you again, I do not want to shoot you, please drop the gun.

412
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,570
起來 你個懦夫!
Stand up,you coward!

413
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,620
Meyers先生 聽我說 都結束了
Mr. Meyers,listen to me. All right,it's over.

414
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,070
Barton醫生沒害死你兒子
Dr. Barton did not kill your son.

415
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,510
你兒子死於車禍
Your son was killed by a car.

416
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,520
他不會希望看到這種情況吧?
And this is not what he would want. Ok?

417
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,350
所以放下槍吧 拜託
So drop the gun. Please.

418
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,780
別開槍
Don't do it.

419
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,590
對不起
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,160
我沒事 去看他 去看他
I'm fine. Go to him. Go to him.

421
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,650
把他的槍踢開 別讓槍挨著他
Kick his gun away. Make sure his gun's not near him.

422
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,620
不 別碰我
No,don't touch me.

423
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,030
我不想活了 別碰我
Oh,i want to die. Oh,don't touch me.

424
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,500
我要幫你止血 好嗎?
I need to stop the bleeding,ok?

425
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,100
讓我死吧
Let me die.

426
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,960
醫生快到了 你能把他穩定下來嗎?
The medics are almost here. Can you keep him stabilized?

427
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,750
應該可以
Yes,i think so.

428
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,560
堅持住 他們來了
Hold on,hold on, they're right here.

429
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,060
急救就來了 堅持住
Help is coming,all right? Hold on,hold on.

430
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,410
我們需要靠背板和護頸圈
We need a backboard and a ccollar.

431
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,230
來了
Coming right up.

432
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,310
壓住這
Put pressure on this right here.

433
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,470
打給急診室 告訴他們傷者胸腔中彈
Call ahead to the e.R., tell them they got a gsw to the thoracic cavity

434
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,730
立即送手術室
and have him redlined to the o.R.Stat.

435
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,380
別碰我
Don't touch me.

436
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,590
子彈好像穿透了
Looks like it went clean through.

437
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,980
你剛剛救了他的命
You might have just saved his life.

438
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,170
壓住這 好嗎?
Keep pressure on this,ok?

439
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,770
我沒事 快去看你兒子 我沒事 快去
I'm good,i'm fine. Go to your son. I'm good. I'm fine. Go.

440
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,930
Jeffrey 你沒事吧?
Jeffrey. You ok?

441
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,650
我沒事
Yeah,fine.

442
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,860
我們送你去醫院
We'll get you to a hospital.

443
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,270
你們快聯繫Emily 打給Emily
You need to find emily. Call emily.

444
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,360
她在哪
Where is she?

445
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,370
Hotch出事了
Something's happened to hotch.

446
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,350
他還在昏迷
He still isn't conscious yet.

447
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,720
你確定是Foyet干的嗎?
You sure it was foyet?

448
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,320
他有Morgan的證件
He had morgan's credentials.

449
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,830
安保攝像頭拍到他了嗎?
Did they catch him on the security cam?

450
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,060
可以看到他把Hotch弄下車 但只有入口有攝像頭
You could see him dropping hotch off, but the camera's only on the entrance,

451
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,750
所以不知道他離開醫院後 往哪個方向走了
so I have no idea what direction he went once he left the hospital.

452
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,850
他送Hotch到急診 沒道理啊
It doesn't make sense for him to have brought hotch to the e.R.

453
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,700
Foyet要的是權利和操縱
We know foyet gets off on power and control.

454
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,290
也許他就是想說 Hotch的命握在他手
Maybe what he wants is for hotch to know his life was in his hands.

455
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,060
他不來醫院冒險 也能做到
He could do that without risking the hospital.

456
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,200
探員 他醒了
Agents,he's waking up.

457
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,000
記住 他還很虛弱 別勉強他
Remember,he's weak. Don't push him.

458
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,750
我在哪?
Where am i?

459
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,570
在醫院
In the hospital.

460
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,580
我怎麼會在這?
How did I get here?

461
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,650
Foyet送你來的
Foyet drove you.

462
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,010
你記得發生什麼事了嗎?
Can you remember what happened?

463
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,750
你應該做那個交易
You should have made a deal.

464
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,790
他拿走了什麼? 什麼意思?
What did he take? ******

465
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,220
惡魔獵手每次都拿走受害者的東西
The reaper always takes something from his victims.

466
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,420
知道他拿了什麼嗎?
Do we know what he took?

467
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:47,580
你的日程本少了一頁通訊錄 B開頭的
There was a page missing from your day planner in the address section, the bs.

468
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,690
他留下了什麼?
What did he leave?

469
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,790
不知道
I don't know.

470
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,340
他也會留下東西給受害人
He also leaves something with his victims.

471
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,690
整個公寓我都看了 沒有什麼異常
I looked over your whole apartment. Nothing felt out of place.

472
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,210
我的衣服呢？
Where are my clothes?

473
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,360
Haley娘家姓Brooks
Haley's maiden name is brooks.

474
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,190
怕信息落到別人手 我就把她列在B開頭那欄了
I always listed her in the bs in my personal information in case it fell into the wrong hands.

475
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,580
他知道他們住哪了
He knows where they live.

476
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,490
Haley不接電話
haley's not answering.

477
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,260
Garcia 在
Garcia. Right here.

478
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,350
派FBI特警部隊到Hotch原住址 馬上
I need fbi s.W.A.T.Deployed to hotch's old address. Do it now.

479
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,150
天啊 他要對付Haley和Jack?
Oh,god,do you think he's going after haley and jack?

480
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,480
我不知道 先派特警隊過去
I don't know. Just send a s.W.A.T.Team.

481
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,650
讓他們等候指令 我們馬上就到
Tell them to wait for instructions. We're on our way.

482
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,810
他們在那接應
Consider them there.

483
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,680
一會不知結果如何 我們要有心理準備
We need to be prepared for what we might find.

484
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,220
Foyet沒有殺掉Hotch 肯定有原因
Foyet kept hotch alive. He wouldn't do that without a reason.

485
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,310
你應該做那個交易
*******

486
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,870
這是我側寫的結果嗎? 不能對我表現出恐懼？
Is this part of my profileyou can't show me fear?

487
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,030
你看不見恐懼 是因為我並不怕你
If you don't see fear, maybe it's because i'm not afraid of you.

488
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,090
說得跟真的一樣
You said that like you actually meant it.

489
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,340
我的朋友Morgan探員現在怎樣?
How's my friend agent morgan?

490
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,040
你是想殺我 還是想玩遊戲?
Are you here to kill me, or are you here to play games?

491
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,730
你覺得呢
You tell me.

492
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,430
指明我的行為根源
Enlighten me about my behavior.

493
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,960
告訴我 我會用這個嗎?
So tell me, would I use this?

494
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,980
出什麼事了? 不知道
What happened? I don't know.

495
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,030
Hotchner探員 聽得見嗎 Hotchner探員?
Agent hotchner. Can you hear me? Agent hotchner?

496
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,990
我沒事 麻煩你先離開病房
I'm ok. I'm gonna need you to step out of the room.

497
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,330
慢慢吸氣
Breathe in slowly.

498
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,000
呼氣
And exhale.

499
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,510
後門就緒?
Ready in back?

500
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,600
就緒
Ready.

501
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,660
進!
Go!

502
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,770
天哪! 沒事 沒事
Oh,my god! It's ok. It's ok.

503
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,930
你們這是幹什麼? 沒事的 不要慌
What are you doing here? It's ok. Everything's ok.

504
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,270
我們找到她了 發生了什麼事?
We got her. What's going on?

505
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,910
屋媮晹釦O人嗎?
Is there anyone else in the house?

506
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,730
沒別人了
No,there's no one here.

507
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,450
Haley Jack呢?
Haley,where's jack?

508
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,530
他在一個朋友家堛
He's at a friend's house for a play date.

509
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,940
我們得接他回來
We need to get him back here.

510
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,900
待會兒跟你詳細解釋
We'll explain everything.

511
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,480
Aaron在哪? 在醫院
Where's aaron? He's in the hospital.

512
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,010
什麼? Haley 拜託了 打電話給Jack
What? Haley,please. Call for jack.

513
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,540
告訴他們我現在去接他
Tell them i'm on the way to pick him up.

514
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,920
我保證會向你解釋清楚
I promise you we'll explain.

515
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,530
現在就給他打電話
Call for him right now.

516
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,420
地址發給我
Text me the address.

517
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,210
告訴我Aaron怎麼了
Tell me what happened to aaron.

518
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,890
他們會殺了你
They will kill you.

519
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,810
別說話 你失血過多
Don't speak. You lost a lot of blood.

520
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,000
留點氧氣吧
You'll need your oxygen.

521
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:37,450
知道瞭解人體到何種程度 才能不斷刺傷自己 還保住命嗎?
Do you know how much you have to study the human body to stab yourself repeatedly and not die?

522
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,100
不是顯擺 但我怎麼也算個行家
I don't want to brag, but i'm somewhat of an expert.

523
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,330
想看看我的傷疤嗎?
Do you want to see my scars?

524
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,490
怎樣? 還喜歡嗎?
What do you think? You like 'em?

525
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,350
你也會變這樣的
Yours are gonna look just the same.

526
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,820
我的人..
My team...

527
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,500
你的人
Your team.

528
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,680
要是我不想被抓 你的人根本抓不到我
Your team didn't catch me until I wanted them to.

529
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,420
現在你說了不算 別傻了
You're not in charge, so don't be foolish.

530
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,710
盡量放鬆些
Now try to relax.

531
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,390
你的身體會變得麻木
Your body will go numb.

532
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,250
只要你放鬆...
And it goes in so much easier...

533
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,430
刀子進去就容易多了
If you relax.

534
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:50,520
最難受的可不是痛暈過去
The hard part is not passing out from the pain.

535
00:34:54,050 --> 00:35:00,310
我知道側寫員認為刀刺是對性行為的代替
Now,i understand that profilers think that stabbing is a substitution for the act of sex.

536
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,440
要是罪犯性無能 就會選擇用刀來代替
That if somebody's impotent, they'll use a knife instead.

537
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,650
你覺得是嗎 Hotchner探員?
Is that what you think, agent hotchner?

538
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,940
也許這次會改變你的側寫手法
Maybe this will change the way that you profile.

539
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,540
他們沒事
They're safe.

540
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,540
有必要這樣嗎?
Is this really necessary?

541
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,330
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

542
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,660
要多久? 我不知道
For how long? I don't know.

543
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,420
媽咪!
Mommy!

544
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,610
他們讓我開警笛玩!
They let me turn on the siren!

545
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,410
太厲害了 寶貝! 好玩嗎?
Wow,that's so great,baby! Did you have fun?

546
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,360
我去Jack房間幫忙收拾行李 好的
I'll help start a bag in jack's room. Ok.

547
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,140
你玩了幾次哇?
How many times did you run it?

548
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,130
幾次? 3次?
How many times? 3?

549
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,960
你去了我家?
You were at my place, right?

550
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,220
看出他怎麼進去的嗎?
Could you tell how he got in?

551
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,800
我不知道
I'm not sure.

552
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,250
想談談發生的事嗎?
Do you want to talk about what happened?

553
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,270
我不記得了
I don't know.

554
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,860
只記得他刺的第一刀 其他一片空白
After he stabbed me the first time, it all goes blank.

555
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,890
你覺得怎麼樣?
How do you feel?

556
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,410
我會好起來的
I'm gonna be ok.

557
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,670
他們跟你解釋怎麼回事沒?
Did they explain to you what's happening?

558
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,190
他們說聯邦執法署直接 從這兒接走我們 進行保護性監管
They said the marshals service is taking us straight from here and putting us into protective custody.

559
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,170
Haley 對不起
Haley,i'm sorry.

560
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,880
他們要帶我們去哪?
Do you know where they're gonna take us?

561
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,760
我不知道 但這才是重點
No,i don't. And that's the point.

562
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,670
我不能知道你們去哪
I can't know where you're going.

563
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,590
只要你一聯繫別人 他就會找到你
If you have any contact with anyone, then he could track you.

564
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,780
Jack要上學見朋友 我也要工作
Jack has school. He has friends. I have a job now.

565
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:02,370
我知道 對不起
I know. And i'm sorry.

566
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,360
我們一定抓住他 到時你們就能回來了
We will catch him and you'll come back,

567
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,550
我保證會用盡餘生來補償你
and I promise that I will spend the rest of my life making this up to you.

568
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,860
你肯定我們現在有危險?
Are you sure that we're in danger?

569
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,170
對
Yes.

570
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,270
那你呢? 你安全嗎?
And what about you? Are you gonna be safe?

571
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,330
他想看我痛苦
He wants to see me suffer.

572
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,570
他知道 與兒子分別比殺了我更有用
Knowing that my son is out there and that I can't see him is better than killing me.

573
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,350
那我要怎麼跟Jack說?
What am I supposed to say to jack?

574
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,860
告訴他這是度假 不會很久的
Tell him it's a vacation and that it's not gonna be for very long.

575
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:57,590
都沒個相識的人幫忙 我要怎麼保護他?
How am I supposed to keep him safe if there is no one I know to help me?

576
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,400
Haley 你很堅強
Haley,you're strong.

577
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,600
你接受了我的工作 幾乎獨自撫養Jack
You lived with me in this job, and you've practically raised jack all by yourself.

578
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,980
你是個偉大的母親
You're a great mother.

579
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,220
你能抓到他嗎?
Can you catch this man?

580
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,910
我會抓到他的
I will catch this man.

581
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,730
Jack想進來
Jack wants to come in.

582
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,080
我也想見他 但現在不合適
I want to see him,too. I just don't think it's a good idea.

583
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,180
我知道你是想保護他
Look,i know you're trying to protect him.

584
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,760
但見一面對你們都好 拜託了
But you both need this. Please.

585
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,070
好吧
Ok.

586
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,750
嘿 小傢伙 進來
Hey,buddy. Come on in.

587
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,610
好勒
All right.

588
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,250
別擔心 沒事的
Don't worry. It's ok.

589
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,450
醫生檢查了 我一點事都沒有
The doctors made sure that i'm completely fine.

590
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,200
媽媽告訴你沒 你們要去旅行?
Did mommy tell you that you two are gonna take a trip?

591
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,990
說了
Yeah.

592
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,340
那這陣子我們見不著了
So i'm not gonna see you for a while.

593
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,180
為什麼?
Why?

594
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,450
想想看爸爸出差工作的時候
Well,think about it like when daddy goes away for work.

595
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,040
只是這次換你和媽媽離開
Only this time you and mommy get to go someplace.

596
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,190
記得我每次離開說的話嗎?
But what do I tell you every time I go away?

597
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,770
你愛我 勝過這世上的一切
You love me. More than anything in the world.

598
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,910
你沒事嗎?
Are you ok?

599
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,220
我為你而驕傲 每一天都是
I'm very proud of you. Every single day.

600
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,820
我們很快會見面的 好嗎? 好
I'll see you soon,ok? Ok.

601
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,430
你要照顧好媽媽 知道嗎? 知道
You take care of mom,ok? Ok.

602
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,400
我知道Aaron很擔心
I know aaron's worried.

603
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,980
告訴他 我會把他們當家人來保護的
Tell him i'll protect them like they're my own.

604
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,020
我剛跟Spence談過 他沒事的
I just talked to spence. He's gonna be fine.

605
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,590
不過得有好一陣子撐枴杖了
He's gonna have to be on crutches for a while,

606
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,730
不過他說反正踹門是Morgan的活
but he said kicking down doors is morgan's job,anyway.

607
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,090
Foyet拿你證件 跟這件事一點關係沒有
You know,foyet having your credentials had nothing to do with any of this.

608
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,830
他只是想這樣來折磨你
It was just his way of trying to torture you.

609
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,870
我知道 Foyet要的是權利和操縱
Yeah,i know. Foyet's about power and control.

610
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,190
他等著看我崩潰...
He was hoping to watch me fall apart,and...

611
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,630
現在他想毀掉Hotch
Now he wants to destroy hotch.

612
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,500
沒錯 這就是他的計劃 現在我們要阻止他
Exactly. That's his plan, and now we fight it.

613
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,310
你聽說今早的事了嗎?
Did you hear what happened this morning?

614
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,370
沒有
No.

615
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,660
有個案子
We had a situation.

616
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,650
不明疑犯已經殺害兩人
Unsub had already killed 2 people.

617
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:45,390
還要求一個男人兒子當誘餌 否則還會繼續動手
Said he was gonna keep killing unless a man used his son as bait.

618
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,830
然後呢?
What happened?

619
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,370
我們保護了那個男孩 給出了側寫
We kept the boy safe. Worked the profile.

620
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,410
圓滿大結局
It was a happy ending.

621
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,890
知道我為什麼告訴你嗎?
Do you know why i'm telling you this?

622
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,030
知道
Yes.

623
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:07,660
你的團隊在過去幾小時辦到的 世上沒有其他人做得到
No other group in the world could have pulled off what your team did in a matter of hours.

624
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,220
我很感激你說這些話 Dave
I appreciate what you're trying to do,dave.

625
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,210
我們會抓到Foyet的
We'll get foyet.

626
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,720
我向Haley承諾我們會抓到他 但事實是
I promised haley that we would get him, but the truth is,

627
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,980
要是他不再殺戮 我們根本找不到他
if he stops killing, we have no way of tracking him.

628
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:24,250
之前他停止殺戮10年 只是為了欣賞 Shaunessy的生活分崩瓦解
He stopped killing for 10 years just for the pleasure of watching shaunessy's life fall apart.

629
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,220
10年後 Jack還會記得我什麼?
What's jack gonna remember about me in 10 years?

630
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,560
Hotch 看著我
Hotch,look at me.

631
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,410
我現在告訴你 我們一定會抓到他的
I'm telling you, we'll get him.

632
