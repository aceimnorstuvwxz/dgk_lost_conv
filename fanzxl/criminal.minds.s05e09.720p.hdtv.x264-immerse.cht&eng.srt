And have you worked under agent Hotchner the entire time?

不 女士 我目前聽命於代理主管Derek Morgan
No, ma'am. i currently Report to acting unit chief Derek Morgan.

35
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,209
他接管了這個部門 是因為Hotchner探員的能力 使得整個團隊的顏面蕩然無存
Who took over the unit because agent Hotchner's Ability to lead the team had become compromised.

36
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,089
我...我認為這不是原因
I--i don't believe that's the reason.

37
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,570
你有不同的觀點?
You have a different opinion?

你有不同的理解?
You have a different understanding?

40

Hotchner探員自願退下來 就能使我們的工作順利進行下去

我們那時都在調查惡魔獵人
We were all investigating the reaper.

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,119
Hotchner探員只是其中一個人
Ssa Hotchner was not the only one,

46
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,479
尤其是他給我們看了那張名片後
Especially after he sent us that calling card.

47
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,059
他寄給Karl Arnold的報紙文章

48
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,619
兩封信來自兩個不同的地方

49
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,480
令我們再次關注此案
They ramped us all back up again.

50
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,030
我開始時就該說的
I should just start at the beginning.

51
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,109
Foyet在最初的一連串殺戮中 給自己製造了很多傷
Foyet had done a lot of injury to himself In the original string of killings,

52
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,410
目的是要裝成受害者 擺脫我們的調查
In an effort to paint himself as a victim And throw us off the investigation.

53
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,109
結果他開始嚴重依賴大量藥性極強的藥物
As a result, he became dependent upon A large number of extremely strong medications.

54
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,540
我們過去一直在全國上下尋找那些 使用多種混合處方的病人
We'd been searching the country for patients With that exact prescription combination,

55
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,340
但是 我們卻不怎麼走運
But we hadn't had any luck.

56
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,379
Foyet寄給Arnold的信封 就要從實驗室送回來了
The envelopes Foyet mailed to arnold are due back from the lab.

57
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,669

They're processed. clean. no prints, no dna.

60
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,509
她說它們非常乾淨
She says they're clean.

61
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,730
是的 它們當然乾淨
Yeah, of course they are.

I don't care if you have to drive To the postmaster general's house.

64
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,269
我只想在團隊著手之前 知道郵戳是在哪婸\的
I want to know where those postmarks were applied Before the team gets in.

65
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,090
是的 女士 明白
Yes, ma'am. copy that.

66

找到了
Found it.

67
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,219
他還是不肯喝奶
He's still not taking his bottle.

68
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,729
給我 讓我試試
Here. let me try.

69
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,769
嘿...你能喝奶嗎?
Hey... Can you take your bottle, please?

70
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,219
您能...哦 太謝謝你了
Can you take--oh... Thank you so much.

71
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,529
哦 是的 你真是媽媽的小乖乖 嗯?
Oh, yeah. you are definitely mama's little boy, huh?

72
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,450
就像他老爸一樣

嘿 如果你有事 就走吧
Hey, if you have to go, go ahead.

75
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,110
這些就交給我吧
I can take care of this.

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,910
如果我是Hotch 我都不知怎麼辦了
I don't know what i would do if i were in Hotch's shoes.

77
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,939
如果我要跟你和Henry分開 就因為...
If i ever had to say good-bye to you and henry because--

78
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,700
我們哪都不去
We'rnot going anywhere.

79
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,840
我們不會的
We're not.

80
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,210
你在尋找處方 你在尋找郵戳
You're tracking the prescriptions, You're tracking the postmarks.

81
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,430
你已經竭盡所能 無可指責了
Aside from another body landing on your doorstep, You're doing all you can.

82
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,150
為了Hotch 但願如此
I hope so, For Hotch's sake.

83
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,960
- 下一個 - 該我們了
- Next. - That's us.

84
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,590
這是你們的
Here we are.

85
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,759
哦 實際上 應該有兩個處方
Oh, actually, there should be 2 prescriptions.

86
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,990
我們有抗生素 但沒有抗組胺劑
We filled the antibiotics, But we're out of the antihistamine.

87
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,989
你知道麼 碾碎半片克敏能的效果是一樣的
You know, crushing half a claritin Would do the job just the Same.

88
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,169
也給你省了點錢
Save you a couple bucks, too.

89
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,799
等一下...請問
Wait--excuse me,

90
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,269
有許多非處方藥可以替代處方藥嗎?
Are there a lot Of over-the-counter medications That can be substituted for prescriptions?

91
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,419
太多了 數都數不過來
Too many to count.

92
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,650
大多數情況下 只是劑量的問題
Most of the time, it's just a matter of dosage.

93
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,510
Foyet的藥... 我們一直在尋找所有的組合
Foyet's meds--we have been tracking the entire combination.

94
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,599
如果他一直用非處方藥替代其中一些處方藥 來掩飾自己的購買的藥物怎麼辦?
What if he's been using over-the-counter meds For some of it to mask his purchases?

95
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,639
好的 縮小收縮範圍
Ok, narrow the search.

96
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,219
主要看看那些不能替代的藥物 做的不錯
focus on the meds He can't substitute. good work.

97
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,060
郵政部長檢查員辦公室剛打了個電話
just got a call From the postmaster general inspector's office.

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,139
這麼快?
Already?

99
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,490
我可不是光說不做的小白臉
I'm not just a pretty face.

100
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,960
能找到Garcia吧
Is garcia in yet?

101
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,480
你不吃嗎?
Are you sure?

102
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,289
燻肉卷 機不可失失不再來啊
Bacon doughnut. you'll never be the Same.

103
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,770
那就讓我華麗地失不再來吧
I can totally think of more palatable ways To up my adventure quotient, thank you.

104
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,149
我..的..天
O...m...g.

105
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,149
每次嘗試都有嶄新的感覺
It gets better every time.

106
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,870
Kevin 你得先出去一下了
Kevin, you need to leave right now.

107
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,209
你需要喝點什麼嗎?
Would you like some water?

108
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,510
不用了 謝謝 長官
No, thank you, ma'am.

109
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,930
你沒事吧
Are you all right?

110
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,350
嗯 我 我只是不太...
I--i'm just not, uh,

111
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,550
不大習慣這種
Comfortable with any of this.

112
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,450
我感覺不好
It's not ok.

113
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,320
你指的什麼?
What do you mean?

114
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,570
在我看來 大家關注的方向錯了
In my opinion, Everyone is asking the wrong questions.

115
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,089
難道沒有人關心開膛手對他們做過什麼
Doesn't anybody care About what the reaper did to them,

116
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,699
他傷害了多少人
How many people he hurt?

117
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,050
人們關心的竟然是...
All anyone seems to care about is...

118
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,570
我不覺得這是正確的
This just isn't right.

119
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,930
你覺得Hotchner探員表現得是否有些...
Do you think that agent Hotchner was acting...

120
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,399
過於激動無法理解
Agitated or unreasonable?

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,869
他 不不不 他...
He... No, no, he--

122
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,429
他是擔心他的家人
He was freaked out about his family.

123
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,000
鑒於已經發生的慘劇 我認為是完全可以理解的
Which, considering what happened, I'd say was perfectly reasonable.

124
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,329
Foyet的信分別從弗吉尼亞的弗雷德塈J斯堡
The Foyet letters came from fredericksburg, virginia,

125
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,299
和馬媊鶞澈織絞荋粟S寄來的
And westminster, maryland.

126
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,759
我們需要將兩所城市地圖
We can match the prescription drugs

127
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,729
和Foyet無法找到替代品的處方藥 進行交叉地理側寫
Foyet can't substitute with a geographic profile Of the 2 cities.

128
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,709
無法替代品?
Can't substitute?

129
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,369
你需要找到那些必須由藥劑師經手
We need you to track the drugs that can't be emulated With over-the-counter drugs

130
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,859
沒辦法造假的非處方藥 動作要快
and can only be dispensed By a pharmacist, and you need to do it quickly.

131
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,499
Foyet不會在一個地方久留
Foyet doesn't stay in one place very long.

132
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,970
那我們得讓Kevin留在這
Then Kevin needs to stay.

133
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,839
- 什麼? - 長官 Kevin是個非常出色的分析專家
- What? - ir, Kevin is an amazing analyst.

134
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,259
- 有他幫忙絕對事半功倍 - 那好吧
- I can work almost twice as fast with him running part of my system. - Fine.

135
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,689
- 你用那邊的機器 - Garcia 大概要多久?
- these are your screens. - Garcia, now long?

136
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,849
進入系統之後才能知道
I'll know once i get into it.

137
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,089
我們要先做地理側寫
We're gonna work the geographic profile.

138
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,850
有情況馬上匯報 要快
Call me when you have something. and hurry.

139
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,439
好的 我先從曲馬多找起
Uh, ok... I am gonna start with the ultram--

140
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,119
不 你先從曲馬多和?普生找起 （這兩種均為鎮痛藥）
No--you're gonna start with the ultram and naproxen.

141
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,250
我來找其他的
I'll work on the rest.

142
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,889
從弗雷德塈J斯堡到威斯敏斯特大概有115英里
There's approximately 115 miles Between fredericksburg and westminster.

143
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,709
為什麼從兩個城市寄信呢
Why mail a letter from 2 cities?

144
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,399
可能是心理戰術
Maybe it's purely a forensic countermeasure.

145
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,679
他知道在家附近寄信會引火燒身
He knows that mailing letters close to home would lead us right to him,

146
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,899
所以開車大老遠跑去寄信以甩掉我們的視線
So he drives far away to mail the letters to throw us off his scent.

147
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,989
郵件炸彈客和01年炭疽襲擊都是如此
The unabomber did that. so did the 2001 anthrax suspect.

148
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,439
他也可以選其他地方 但他還是在特區周圍作案
He could have gone anywhere, but he's trolling the d.c. area.

149
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,309
這說明他還是要接近Hotch
It makes sense to stay close to Hotch.

150
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,120
他曾逗留在波士頓附近 監視Shaunessy警官的惡化情況
He stuck around boston to watch shaunessy deteriorate.

151
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,180
- 不 我不是說你... - 沒關係
- Not that you're-- - It's all right.

152
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,669
我知道他在監視我
i know he's been watching me.

153
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,059
這也是我自願降職的部分原因
It's part of the reason i stepped down,

154
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,040
讓他認為我已經精神崩潰
So he'd think i was falling apart.

155
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,600
大多數非處方藥局都可以開到?普生 (抗炎鎮痛藥)
Naproxen is available in generic brands over the counter.

156
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,900
?普生鈉緩釋片堶惆膃?普生的藥性
Naproxen's properties can be simulated by aleve.

157
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,569
曲馬多也可以找到替代品
Ultram can be substituted.

158
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,749
好的 再找奧施康定 (另一種鎮痛藥品)
Ok, oxycontin.

159
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,549
天 他還用這個?
Jeez, he's on that, too?

160
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,609
沒錯 不過這個藥品很容易上癮 所以產量被限制
Yeah, and it's highladdictive and therefore regulated,

161
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,809
所以無法找到替代品
So there's no substitute for it.

162
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,209
我知道藥監局管得嚴
I know the dea has a problem with it.

163
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,559
但有門路的話還是能買得到
You can buy it on the streets if you know where to go.

164
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,349
的確如此 既然這玩意兒能從其他渠道搞來
Good point. ok, we're gonna leave that off the list for now

165
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,249
那麼就先不在這個名單上面找它了
'cause there's another way to get it.

166
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,549
下一個  甲巰咪唑
next up...Tapazole.

167
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,370
那是什麼?
What's that?

168
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,969
它是治療甲狀腺功能亢進的
Uh, it treats hyperthyroidism.

169
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,739
嗨 到底這傢伙得的什麼病啊
Hey, what's wrong with this guy, anyway?

170
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,390
他喜歡自己捅自己玩兒
He stabbed himself--a lot.

171
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,509
捅自己?
Stabbed himself?

172
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,019
是 所以他遍體鱗傷
Yeah. so his body would have permanent internal damage--

173
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,529
親愛的 別停啊 所以他需要這些處方藥保證他的心率正常
Work, honey--and he'd need This prescription to regulate his heart rate,

174
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,049
降低心悸和震顫
Keep down the palpitations and the tremors.

175
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,799
甲疏咪唑沒有可替代藥品
And there is no substitute for tapazole.

176
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,059
如果咱們少了這一個 怎麼能找出他呢
So if this is our missing link, how do we find him?

177
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,195
把兩個城市方圓60英里所有用這個處方的人 都打印出來
Print out every person who's on this prescription Within a 60-mile of both cities.

178
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:10,345
剩下的工作交給他們
the team will do the rest.

179
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:11,440
我得用一下你的手提電腦
I'm gonna use your laptop.

180
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,850
兩個城市 我們怎麼辦
Ok, so what are we gonna do about the 2 cities?

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,149
咱們地理側寫一般不是都需要三個地點 才能準確進行定位的嗎
Usually we need 3 different points to get an accurate geographic profile.

182
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,489
可是現在只有兩個
That's all we got right now.

183
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,329
蓋瑟斯堡 羅克韋爾 首府特區 亞歷山德堥
Gaithersburg, Rockville, D.c., Alexandria,

184
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,060
包伊 安納波利斯
Bowie, Annapolis.

185
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,379
Foyet 你到底在哪
Where the hell are you, Foyet?

186
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,229
我和那小子一起找到一個沒辦法買到 非處方藥代替的甲狀腺藥品
Ok, me and the boy found a thyroid medication That has no substitute over the counter.

187
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,549
必須要從藥劑師那媔}
You've gotta get it from a pharmacist.

188
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,889
但是很多人都需要開這個藥
But a lot of people are on it.

189
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,720
找到兩個地方的中間點 縮小到方圓25英里內的名字呢
Find the midpoint between the 2 cities And isolate names in a 25-mile radius.

190
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,240
153個
153 names.

191
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,820
他肯定不會用真名
Well, he's not gonna use his own name.

192
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,719
那他一般會用什麼名字
What kind of aliases should we be looking for?

193
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,649
他可以直接盜用他人的身份
He could have easily stolen someone's identity.

194
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,799
不會的 他是個極度自我陶醉的殺人狂
No, he's a narcissist in love with his own mythology.

195
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,069
他肯定會用與案情有關的名字
He'd use a name connected with the case.

196
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,810
受害者 或者 警察
A victim, maybe, a cop.

197
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,840
咱們看一下Foyet的檔案 找一下死者名單
Ok. let's check the Foyet files For a list of names.

198
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,229
沒有結果
and...Nothing.

199
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,798
等一下 Foyet喜歡一些對他有意義的東西
Wait a minute, guys. Foyet likes things to have meaning to him.

200
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:58,370
那只象徵上帝的眼睛
The eye of providence,

201
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,470
把我們引向他的那個 公車上面的血書地址
The addresses in blood he wrote on the bus that led us back to him.

202
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,439
可能他取別名也是如此
Maybe he's doing the Same thing with the alias.

203
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,270
就像是字母排序之類的那種把戲
Like an anagram or something.

204
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,749
Reid 有什麼發現嗎?
You see something, Reid?

205
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,829
還沒有
Not yet.

206
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,790
Reid 他自稱是開膛手
Reid, he named himself the reaper.

207
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,890
Peter Rhea
Peter Rhea.

208
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,790
阿靈頓有一個Peter Rhea
There's a Peter Rhea in arlington.

209
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,290
找到了
we found him.

210
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,859
在找到George Foyet可能居住的地方後
Once the team located George Foyet's potential apartment,

211
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,490
為什麼BAU小組沒有立即採取行動
Why didn't the bau enter immediately?

212
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,500
- Rossi探員 - 嗯
- Agent Rossi? - Hmm?

213
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,240
我問話呢
I asked you a question.

214
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,090
金價還在升
Gold is still going up.

215
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,220
但什麼時候拋出 就是奧妙所在
But knowing when to get out, that's the trick.

216
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,120
你在說什麼
What are you doing?

217
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,899
Erin 這樣做有什麼意義?
What's the point of all this, erin?

218
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
為什麼?
Why?

219
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,869
確保不再發生類似情況
So this never happens again.

220
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,899
局堥S有任何人能夠 確保此類事情不會再次發生
There is nothing a bureaucrat can do To make sure that something like this never happens again.

221
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,280
難道我們就坐等下次血案?
So we just wait for the next bloodbath?

222
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,740
你們在進Foyet的公寓之前 為什麼要等那麼久?
Why did you wait so long before going to Foyet's apartment?

223
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,520
我們要確定他在堶
We had to be sure he was there.

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,190
如果我們貿然進去 而他不在的話 會打草驚蛇
If we went in and he wasn't, He would know we found him.

225
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,840
誠然 我們等得越久 他越有機會...
Of course, the longer we waited, The more time he had to...

226
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,479
這是個棘手的抉擇
It was an impossible decision.

227
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,870
那麼是誰作出抉擇的?
So who made it?

228
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,640
Hotchner探員嗎?
Agent Hotchner?

229
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,230
我們等了多久了
How much longer do we wait?

230
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,320
決策權不在我手上
I need to leave that call to someone else.

231
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,600
突襲隊已經等得不耐煩了
Swat's getting antsy.

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,229
他們該進去的時候我自然會發話
I'll tell them when it's time to go.

233
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,580
現在 告訴他們在原地老實呆著
Right now we sit tight. let them know.

234
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,689
那群人擅長的可不是原地待命而是突圍啊
These guys are trained to move, not just sit around.

235
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,049
我也不怪他們
I can't really say that i blame them.

236
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,979
可能他已經不在那堣F
He may not even be there anymore.

237
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,419
我知道 有可能我們在這塈今左贖 他人已經逃之夭夭了
I know. the longer we sit here, the further away he gets.

238
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,310
孩子 你已經做了你能做的了
You make the best call you can, kid.

239
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,830
那我們現在這樣
All right, this is what we're gonna do.

240
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,100
我是管理員
Super.

241
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,860
我是管理員
Super.

242
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,409
你的樓上漏水
There's a leak in the apartment above you.

243
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,200
我得檢查一下你是否受到影響
I need to check your ceiling.

244
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,860
你們收到信號了嗎
Are you getting the signal?

245
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
收到
Copy.

246
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,920
堶惆S有人
No warm bodies.

247
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,579
看上去是廚房 有桌椅
Looks like kitchen table, chair.

248
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,330
桌子上面的是電腦嗎
Is that a laptop on the table?

249
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,979
這個可能有用
It could be useful.

250
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,489
那個是食物嗎?把鏡頭拉近
is that food? get closer to that.

251
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,550
等等 拉遠 地上是什麼
Wait, go back. what's that on the floor?

252
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,960
是他的信件
Yeah. it's his mail.

253
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,800
行動 快
Go, go, go, go!

254
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,150
快 立即行動
Hurry up! let's go!

255
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,230
怎麼了?
What happened?

256
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,419
他不會再回來了 食物都沒動過
He's not coming back here. he left an untouched meal.

257
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,318
只有在驚慌失措的情況下才會 把郵件亂扔在地上
You drop your mail like this when you're startled,

258
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:27,879
或者在要馬上逃跑的時候
When you need to get out of dodge quick.

259
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,259
他知道我們要來這 有什麼提醒了他
Something tipped him off. he knew we were coming here.

260
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,969
箱子開著 堶惘陷X件衣服不見了
Suitcases are open, some clothes are missing.

261
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,669
保險箱堶惘陪蚋繳j的地方
There's a safe with a stash of guns in it.

262
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,179
他連鎖都不上了
He didn't even bother to lock them up again.

263
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,059
如果他真的很著急 那就會出錯
If he's in a hurry, he'll make a mistake.

264
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,469
可是一旦Foyet狗急跳牆 他就開始殺人了
Yeah, but when Foyet gets cornered, He starts killing.

265
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,280
我們不能讓這發生
We're not gonna let that happen.

266
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,560
我們得馬上聯繫Garcia
We need to get garcia on this.

267
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,520
他真是很厲害
He is creepy good.

268
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,559
有多厲害?
How good?

269
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,569
他把硬盤全部清空了 可能走得很急
He wiped his hard drive. might have been in a hurry to leave,

270
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,880
不過這也說明硬盤堶悸漯F西都是不可見人的
But whatever was on there, he did not want us to see it.

271
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,299
Garcia 跟我說你能進入系統還原數據
Garcia, tell me that you're hacked in and that you can rebuild it.

272
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,770
親愛的 看著吧
Watch me work, darling.

273
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,670
- 還在嗎? - 有什麼發現
- Hello. - What have you got?

274
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,219
他用Peter Rhea的名字註冊了 一個網絡安全報警器
He had an internet alarm on the name Peter Rhea.

275
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,189
一旦我們開始查 他就會知道
It alerted him as soon as we ran a check on it.

276
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,470
他還刪掉了什麼
What else did he wipe?

277
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,670
Garcia 等等 回到剛才那張圖片
Garcia, wait a minute. freeze it right there.

278
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,869
- 哦上帝 那不是... - 那是負責保護我家人的法警
Oh, my god, isn't that-- That's the u.s. marshal assigned to my family.

279
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,100
Foyet這麼長時間以來一直在監視他
Foyet's been watching him this whole time?

280
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,860
Kass Meyer 請留言
KassMeyer. leave a message.

281
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,779
Sam  是我Aaron 我們找到Foyet的位置了
Sam, it's Aaron. we found Foyet's location,

282
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,029
不過他有監視你的照片
But he has surveillance photos of you.

283
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,850
咱們找地方見一面 或者我們現在去找你
Call me for a meet location or we're on our way to you.

284
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,529
我們得徵調另一支特別行動組
We're gonna need to deploy another swat unit.

285
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,220
那需要半個小時
That's gonna take another half hour.

286
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,069
Hotch
Hotch?

287
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,380
咱們走
Go. go.

288
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,059
你們馬上就去了法警Kass Meyer家
You left for marshal KassMeyer's house immediately?

289
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,040
是的 長官
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,519
你不知道這是戰略應對小組的工作嗎
Wouldn't this be a job for a tactical team?

291
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,189
我們覺得再去申請授權調派 另一支隊伍會浪費很多時間
We felt that it would take too much time To get authorization for another operation.

292
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,859
- "我們"? - 我們所有人
- We? - All of us.

293
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,949
你確定不是Hotchner探員讓你們這麼做的?
Don't you mean agent Hotchner wanted that?

294
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,579
不 我是說我們所有人想法一致
No, i mean all of us wanted that.

295
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,699
我知道你怎麼想
I know what you're thinking,

296
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,119
我也同意 如果只處分他一個人 對我們其他人都會好些
And i agree it would be easy for us to blame him.

297
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,159
好些?
Easy?

298
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,499
是啊 要是像你說的一切都是他的錯 一切都了結了
Yeah. why not just say it's his fault And then we can all just forget about it.

299
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,329
但是 問題在於
But, uh, the problem is,

300
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,049
我的腦子清楚得很 (不像你老糊塗)
I have an eidetic memory,

301
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,790
事實並不是那樣
And that's not what happened.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,810
Sam
Sam.

303
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,779
我是FBI的探員Rossi 我們需要救護車
This is agent Rossi, fbi. we need an ambulance.

304
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,280
這埵酗@個聯邦調查員受傷了
We have a federal officer down.

305
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,769
我不會...我不會...
I wouldn't...i wouldn't...

306
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,999
我們已經叫了救護車
We're getting an ambulance.

307
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,270
- 堅持住 - 我盡力了
- hang on. - I tried.

308
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,640
- 一定要挺住 - 我很抱歉
- Just hang on. - I'm sorry.

309
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,130
你為什麼要道歉?
What are you sorry for?

310
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,399
我已經...已經盡力了
I...i tried.

311
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,090
Jack和Haley現在安全嗎?
Are Jack and Haley safe?

312
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,440
Sam 告訴我發生了什麼事
Sam, tell me what happened.

313
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,740
我不知道他怎麼進來的
I don't know how he got in.

314
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,820
他們在哪?
Where are they?

315
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,319
他們在哪?
Where are they?

316
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,490
我不知道你在說什麼
I don't know what you're talking about.

317
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,680
我總歸會知道的... 不管用什麼辦法
I'm gonna find out... One way or another.

318
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,380
Sam 我不是很明白
Sam, i need to understand.

319
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,430
他知道Jack和Haley在哪麼?
Does he know where Jack and Haley are?

320
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,860
我沒有...
I didn't...

321
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,520
這個小玩意兒...
This little piggy...

322
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,430
看看這個 他是我的了 不是麼?
Look at that. he's not going anywhere, is he?

323
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,489
她的電話是多少? 她的保密電話是多少?
What about her phone number? what's her safe phone number?

324
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,899
我沒有...這已經不重要了
I didn't...it won't matter.

325
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,169
殺了我吧 我什麼都不會說的
Kill me. i'm not telling you anything.

326
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,499
沒那麼容易
You're not gonna get off that easy.

327
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,440
我要你活著去告訴Hotchner探員 是他一手造成了他家人的死
I need you alive so you can tell agent Hotchner That it's his fault that his family's dead.

328
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,510
我 我盡力了 Hotch
I--i tried, Hotch.

329
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,919
他的兩腿和一腳掌受到槍擊
Gunshot wounds to each leg, one foot,

330
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,019
幾隻手指折斷 被暴力毆打過
He's missing several fingers, and appears to be badly beaten.

331
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,440
讓開
Clear out of the way.

332
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,980
給我拿個頸托 在搶救的時候準備好鹽水
Get me a c-collar, prep me a saline drip While i grab a round of vitals.

333
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,759
Sam 你有對什麼藥物過敏嗎?
Sam, are you allergic to any medication?

334
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,690
Hotch
Hotch.

335
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,350
Sam 我在
Sam, i'm right here.

336
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,060
我盡力了
I tried.

337
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,550
確保有外科醫生隨時待命
Make sure they have a trauma surgeon standing by.

338
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,769
你是否相信是Kassmeyer警官的過錯 導致了Hotch家人遇險?
do you believe it was marshal KassMeyer's fault That agent Hotchner's family was compromised?

339
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,889
當然不是
Absolutely not.

340
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,559
你回答得很快啊
You answered that very quickly.

341
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,039
當你被嚴刑拷打時 只有說出實情 才能停止這種折磨
When you're being tortured, there's no end in sight, Except giving them what they want.

342
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,329
而Kassmeyer沒這麼做?
And KassMeyer didn't do that?

343
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,989
他忍受了Foyet給的一切折磨
He withstood everything that Foyet had.

344
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,440
把實情一字一句地告訴我
Then tell me exactly what happened.

345
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,479
- 他還醒著麼? - 要麼進去要麼走開
- Is he conscious? - In and out.

346
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,900
Sam 我是Aaron
Sam, it's Aaron.

347
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,130
你聽得到麼?
Can you hear me?

348
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,339
- Aaron - 我就在這 sam
- Aaron. - I'm right here, Sam.

349
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,049
他血壓在下降
His pressure's dropping.

350
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,349
注射10cc嗎啡
10cc morphine going in.

351
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,189
不要給我用嗎啡 我要保持清醒
Do not sedate me. i need to talk.

352
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,239
Sam Foyet知不知道Jack和Haley在哪?
Sam, does Foyet know where Jack and Haley are?

353
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,030
我沒有告訴他 但已經晚了
I wouldn't tell him. it doesn't matter.

354
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,430
讓我猜猜看
Let me guess.

355
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,790
法警不會以人名排序
The marshals service Doesn't have anything listed by name.

356
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,869
只會用案子代碼而已
Case numbers only.

357
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,490
問題是
The thing is,

358
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,799
這種排序是帶有個人喜好的
This relocation is a bit of a special favor,

359
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,679
也就是說你在家也得辦公
Which tells me that you might bring your work home with you.

360
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,470
誰知道呢? 或許在快速撥號的名單上
Who knows? maybe even on emergency speed dial.

361
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,410
你好 是Haley嗎?
Hello, Haley?

362
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,260
不好意思 打錯了
I'm sorry. wrong number.

363
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,629
你好 是Haley嗎?
Hello, is Haley there?

364
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,129
呃 不好意思
Uh, uh, no, ma'am. i'm sorry.

365
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,669
我打錯了
It must have been a wrong number.

366
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,040
你好 是Haley嗎?
Hello, is Haley there?

367
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,750
你好 Haley?
Hello, Haley?

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,590
是Haley嗎?
Hello, is Haley there?

369
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,820
- Sam? - Haley
- Sam? - Haley.

370
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,890
Hal...
Ohh--hal--

371
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,289
不好意思用了你的真名
Sorry for using your real name, ma'am.

372
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,139
我叫Victor Collins 是聯邦執法局的
My name is victor collins. i'm with the marshals service.

373
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,710
夫人 我們有麻煩了
Ma'am, we have a problem.

374
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,150
Kassmeyer警官被謀殺了
Marshal KassMeyer has been killed,

375
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,019
- 我們擔心你的地址也被暴露了 - 什麼?
- And we're afraid your location may have been compromised. - What?

376
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,709
夫人 請仔細聽好 這關係到你兒子的安危
Ma'am, i need you to focus right now. this is about saving your son.

377
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,930
我們正努力保護Jack 你明白麼?
We're trying to save Jack. do you understand me?

378
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,279
是的
Yes.

379
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,609
我擔心這還沒完 夫人
I'm afraid there's more, ma'am.

380
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,850
我不知道該怎麼開口 但是...
I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but...

381
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,950
你前夫也被謀殺了...
Your ex-husband has been killed as well.

382
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,729
噢 天吶
Oh, god.

383
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,139
我們會帶你和你孩子去安全的地方
We're gonna bring you and your son in safe,

384
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,859
但同時需要你的配合 行嗎?
But i'm gonna need your help for this, ok?

385
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,949
我們打完這通電話後
When we're through speaking, i want you to hang up the phone.

386
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,319
不要打給任何人
Do not attempt to call anybody else.

387
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,189
- 明白了嗎? 你的電話可能會被監聽 - 知道了
- Do you understand me? it could be intercepted. - Yes.

388
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,600
然後去買個可拋式手機
The next thing i need you to do Is buy a disposable cell phone.

389
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,020
接著回到車 用新的手機打給我
Get back in your car, call me at this number.

390
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,889
當我拿到你的號碼後 我再給你個新的號
Once i know your mobile, i'll give you another number

391
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,330
- 隨後告訴你接下來怎麼做 - 好的
- Along with some instructions on how to proceed. - Ok.

392
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,259
夫人 我不想讓你太過擔心
Now, ma'am, i do not want you to worry.

393
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,530
我們會保證你和Jack的安全
We're gonna bring you and Jack in here safely.

394
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,840
你...你確定Aaron已經...?
Are you... Are you sure Aaron is...

395
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,600
- 你確定麼? - 是的 夫人
- Are you sure? - Yes, ma'am.

396
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,340
我很遺憾
I'm terribly sorry.

397
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,630
再見了
See you later.

398
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,700
好吧
Ok.

399
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,630
她正自投羅網
She's going to him.

400
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,930
我很抱歉 Hotch
I'm so sorry, Hotch.

401
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,520
他們正等著你
They're ready for you.

402
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,230
Prentiss探員
Agent Prentiss.

403
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,450
長官
Ma'am.

404
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,610
我們瞭解到Hotchner探員 故意讓自己脫離隊伍 單獨行動
We understand that agent Hotchner Managed to separate himself from the rest of the team.

405
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,399
他沒有"故意"這麼做
He didn't "manage" to do that.

406
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,439
當Kassmeyer警官在救護車堮
When marshal KassMeyer was in the ambulance--

407
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,499
Hotchner探員主動陪同他
Agent Hotchner volunteered to ride along.

408
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,559
在他失去意識前瞭解實情
To get answers before he lost consciousness.

409
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,090
你為什麼不去?
Why didn't you go with him?

410
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,299
我認為沒這必要
It didn't seem necessary.

411
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,660
他這樣和你說的?
Did you tell you that?

412
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,590
這就是你的目的?
Is that what you're looking for,

413
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,150
找一個指控他的罪名?
A way to blame this on him?

414
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,779
這麼做有什麼好處?
What good could that possibly do?

415
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,468
Hotchner探員一直在尋找 脫離隊伍 單獨行動的機會
Agent Hotchner was looking for an opportunity To separate himself from the team

416
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:37,369
- 顯然 他做到了 - 這不是事實
- and he found one. - That isn't true.

417
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,280
他不顧一切 孤注一擲 並且不想有人攔住他
He was desperate and he didn't want someone With a clear head to stop him.

418
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,910
這有什麼問題?
Is there a question in there somewhere?

419
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,640
告訴我Hotchner探員在救護車堮 你們在幹什麼
Tell me what happened while agent Hotchner was in the ambulance.

420
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,050
我們聯繫了聯邦執法局
We contacted the u.s. marshals.

421
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,679
他們說Haley失蹤了
They said Haley was in the wind.

422
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,919
她扔掉了手機 所以無法找到她
She had dumped her cell phone, So there was no way to track her.

423
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,850
Hotchner探員對此有什麼反應?
And how did agent Hotchner react to that news?

424
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,540
Foyet通過Kassmeyer的電話打給Haley
Foyet called Haley from KassMeyer's phone.

425
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,739
好的 我去讓Garcia跟蹤線路 JJ
All right, we'll get garcia to trace it. JJ.

426
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,749
他告訴她說 她的行蹤已經暴露 並且我被謀殺了
He told her she was compromised and i was dead.

427
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,669
你打過給她嗎?
Well, have you called her?

428
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,509
沒 他讓她扔掉手機去買個新的
No. he said to throw her phone away and to buy a disposable.

429
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,970
Hotch 我們這就來接你
Hotch, we're gonna come get you right now.

430
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,859
不需要了 Anderson會把車開來的
No, anderson's bringing me a car.

431
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,309
那我們在辦公室見?
You want to meet back at the office?

432
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,889
我只是希望她至少會打個電話來確認一下
I'm hoping that she's just gonna call me, at least, to check.

433
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,339
Foyet假裝是法警 並通過 Haley熟悉的號碼聯繫她
Foyet posed as a marshal, even called from a number that Haley recognized.

434
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,889
並且斷了她打給Hotchner的念頭 嚇住了她
And then he did what gets him off. he scared her.

435
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,339
不 他麻痹了她 搞定了她
no, he paralyzed her. he overwhelmed her.

436
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,029
現在她對他是完全信任 你認為他會把Haley帶到哪去?
And now she trusts him. where do you think he would take her?

437
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,679
證人保護組在新澤西為她提供了住所
Witness protection had her living in new jersey.

438
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,430
要是他立刻動身的話 可能已經到了
He has a head start. he could be there now.

439
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,730
Garcia有線索了
Garcia's got a trace.

440
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,030
他就在幾個塔覆蓋的範圍內
He's bouncing between a few towers.

441
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,040
- 哪? - 費爾非克斯郡(維吉尼亞州)
- Where? - Fairfax county.

442
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,289
他還在這?
He's still local?

443
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,760
將坐標發到我手機上
Send the coordinates to my phone.

444
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,670
好了
Done.

445
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,089
他幹嗎還不去新澤西?
Why isn't he on his way to new jersey?

446
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,009
等等 那電話開著?
Wait, that phone's on?

447
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,609
是的
Yes.

448
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,190
- Hotch? - 他掛斷了
- Hotch? - He hung up.

449
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,740
該死的
Damn it.

450
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,230
怎麼了?
What's that?

451
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,740
Hotch正打給Foyet
Hotch is calling Foyet.

452
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,289
Hotchner探員
Agent Hotchner.

453
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,439
要是你敢動她一根毫毛的話...
If you touch her...

454
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
溫柔點嘛 就像我對你一樣
Be gentle, like i was with you?

455
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,390
你怎麼用了那麼久?
What the hell took you so long?

456
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,020
我還以為手機出問題了呢
I was beginning to think this phone was dead or something.

457
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,919
怎麼那麼安靜?
Why so quiet?

458
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,959
你懊惱時應該破口大罵才對
You usually lash out when you're frustrated.

459
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,309
我沒懊惱 你並不難找
I'm not frustrated. you're more predictable than you think.

460
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,329
是麼?
Am i?

461
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,649
你不知道Haley在哪
You didn't know where Haley was,

462
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,939
所以你讓她來找你
So you made her come to you.

463
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,529
你說得我很懶一樣
You make me sound lazy.

464
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,510
你只是想展示下你的控制力而已
Just another way for you to show control.

465
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,689
噢 那可太糟了
Oh, that's terrible.

466
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,869
你媽媽想讓你遠離你爸的威脅 但她還不夠強壯
You're mother tried to protect you from your father, But she wasn't strong enough.

467
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,950
你懷恨至今 是不是?
And you hated her for that, didn't you?

468
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,259
你認為所有的女人都很贏弱
You decided that all women were weak.

469
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,069
這可是你說的 不是我
Those are your words, not mine.

470
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,690
你殺掉他們的時候才9歲吧?
What were you, 9 when you killed them?

471
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,099
那只是場交通事故
It was a car accident.

472
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,800
你並沒有因為這件事 而受到表揚
That you couldn't take credit for. That had to be hard for you.

473
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,030
但是可憐的George又有了次機會
But poor George got another chance.

474
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,969
這個被遺棄的小孩被一對富有但卻無法生育的 東部夫婦所收養 Foyet一家
The little orphan was saved By the wealthy, sterile eastside couple, the Foyets.

475
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,459
故事本該就此結束
And the story should have ended there.

476
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,649
我不相信童話故事 你呢?
I don't believe in fairy tales. do you?

477
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,360
問題是 George 這可不是童話故事
That's the thing, George. this isn't a fairy tale.

478
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,869
你不必書寫這故事
You don't have to write this story.

479
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,159
你什麼都不必做
You don't have to do any of this.

480
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,659
我知道你已經精疲力盡了
I know you're exhausted.

481
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,060
總是回頭看
Always looking over your shoulder,

482
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,389
總在想到底什麼時候才是終點?
Always wondering when the other shoe is gonna drop.

483
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,020
你難道還沒得到你想要的麼?
Haven't you gotten what you wanted?

484
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,319
你讓你自己變得和其他人與眾不同
You've set yourself apart from anybody we've ever dealt with.

485
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,850
你不僅僅是個連環殺手 你是屠夫
You're not just a famous serial killer, you're the reaper.

486
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,060
我們將研究你這個案例很多年
We're gonna study you and your methods for years and years.

487
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,780
你知道我一直在想什麼嗎?
You know what i've been thinking?

488
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,120
Haley一頭黑髮看上去真是楚楚動人啊
Haley looks pretty good with dark hair.

489
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,200
她好像變瘦了
She's lost some weight.

490
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,720
一定是你給她帶來了太多壓力
Must be all the stress you caused her.

491
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,030
小傢伙在哪呢?
Where's the little man?

492
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,400
看到他了
Oh. there he is.

493
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,300
他喜歡美國隊長是受你的影響嗎? (美國漫畫堛漱@個角色)
Does he like captain america because of you?

494
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,840
你妻子打來的
That's your wife.

495
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,340
等一下哦
Hold, please.

496
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,730
Hotchner太太
Mrs. Hotchner.

497
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,749
我來了
I'm here.

498
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,569
打開大門讓我進去吧
Open the gate and i'll drive in.

499
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,510
好的
Ok.

500
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,390
Aaron?
Aaron?

501
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,600
我先掛了
I really gotta go.

502
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,259
你還沒查到Foyet在哪嗎?
and you still didn't know where Foyet was?

503
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,209
那手機屬於美國聯邦執法局
The phone belonged to a U.S. Marshal.

504
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,099
特殊設計過 能避過信號塔
It was designed to bounce between towers,

505
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,959
所以無法定位他的具體位置
So we could not pinpoint his location.

506
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,909
Hotchner探員就那樣漫無目的地 開著車四處找?
And agent Hotchner was driving around aimlessly.

507
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,840
不
No.

508
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,460
他沒有
He wasn't.

509
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,439
我們有Foyet的側寫
We had Foyet's profile,

510
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,740
我們知道只要跟隨側寫 就會知道他把Hotch的家人帶到哪
And we knew if we followed it, We would know were he took Hotch's family.

511
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,779
好的 Foyet喜歡掌控一切
All right, Foyet has to be in control.

512
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,019
他讓Haley主動找他
He had Haley come to him.

513
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,019
沒錯 但他會把她帶到哪去?
Yeah, but where would he take her?

514
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,779
他希望Hotch能找到他 去看看他身處什麼地方
He'd want Hotch to find him, to see where he was,

515
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,749
- 看著他做了什麼 - 也就是說...
- to see what he did. - Which means he--

516
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,799
他和Hotch通話的時候有透露關於地點的線索
He said something on that call That tells Hotch where to go.

517
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,129
Reid 他都說了些什麼?
Reid, what did he say, exactly?

518
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,979
"Haley一頭黑髮看上去真是楚楚動人啊 她好像變瘦了
"Haley's hair looks good dark. she's lost some weight.

519
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,439
一定是因為你給她帶來的壓力
"it must be because of all the stress you caused her.

520
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,799
小傢伙在哪呢?看到他了
"where's the little man? oh, there he is now.

521
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,369
你覺得他喜歡美國隊長是受你的影響嗎?
"do you think he likes captain america because of you?

522
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,759
你妻子打來的電話 等一下
"that's your wife on the other line. hold, please.

523
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,329
嗨 打開大門讓我進去
