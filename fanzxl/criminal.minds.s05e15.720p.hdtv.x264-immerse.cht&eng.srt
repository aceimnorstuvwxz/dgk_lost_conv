- What is mommy feeding you? - Oh,nice. Give our daughter a weight complex.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,840
- 你有體重情結麼? - 有~
- Do you have a weight complex? - Yes.

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,660
進去吧

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,840
"即使我在困苦中迷途 你仍延續著我的生活"
"though I wal in the midst of trouble, "you preserve my life.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,290
"你伸手護我 抵抗敵人的怒火"
"you stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes,

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,890
"你用你的右手拯救了我 上帝的意旨"
"and with your right hand,you save me. The word of the lord."

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,590
感謝上帝
Thanks be to god.

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,800
上帝之身
The body of christ.

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,490
- 上帝之身 - 阿門
- The body of christ. - Amen.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,390
- 上帝之身 - 上帝之血
- The body of christ. - The blood of christ.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,010
阿門
Amen.

13
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,940
爸爸 我能喝一點嗎?
Daddy,can I have some of that?

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,610
21歲之後才行 或者 等你的第一次聖餐之後
Not till you're 21 Or your first communion.

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,590
- 媽媽 我的娃娃... - 好了 我先幫你拿著
- Mommy,my doll-- - Ok,I'm taking this away from you.

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,570
- 不行! - 好 好 但現在不是玩的時候
- No! - Hey,ok,now is not the time to play.

17
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,610
聖餐之後 我們要向基督傾訴
After communion,we talk to jesus.

18
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,250
- 我不要跟基督說話 - 試著說說
- I don't want to talk to jesus! - Well,try.

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,570
我知道這不容易 但如果你試著用心傾訴
Listen,I know it's hard, but if you really try...

20
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,630
親愛的? 親愛的?
Honey? Honey?

21
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,890
救命! 天啊! 救命! 來人啊! 救命啊!
Help! Oh,god! Please! Somebody help me! Somebody,please!

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,730
來人啊救命! 來人啊! 來人啊救命!
Please help me! Please! Please help me!

23
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,960
- 爸爸你沒事吧? - 有人是醫生嗎?
- Daddy,are you all right? - Is anyone a doctor?

24
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,740
打911!
Call 911!

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,960
不! 趕緊把你女兒帶走! 快!
Oh,no! Take your daughter away! Now!

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,720

Baby! Baby,come here! Come here. Come here. Come here. Come on.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,810
Paul! Paul! 快打911!
Paul! Paul! Call 911!

28
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,290
這是Paul Collins上尉
This is captain paul collins.

29
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,150
他是羅得島 普羅維頓斯 兩周之內第三個受害者了
He's the third victim in 2 weeks In providence,rhode island.

30
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,930

- Captain? - Yeah,he just returned home 2 weeks ago From his fourth tour in iraq.

31
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,140
被授勳為戰鬥英雄
He's a decorated war hero.

32
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,740
他是因為軍隊出身 才被當做目標的嗎?
Was he targeted because he's in the military?

33
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,920
不 跟前兩個受害者一樣 殺他們是因為容易被殺
No. Just like the first two victims, he was targeted because he was convenient.

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,460
他是在教堂做禮拜的時候被殺的
He was killed at a church during an early service.

35
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,770
頸部被割開 頸動脈瞬間大出血
Bled out in a matter of moments.

36
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,860
就在他女兒面前
Right in front of his daughter.

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,610
在教堂殺人 很有象徵性
Murder in a church is highly symbolic.

38
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,090
是否牽扯到什麼宗教爭議?
Is there a religious agenda involved?

39
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,560
鑒於前兩名受害者情況 負責調查的 Jake Moreland警探把這一原因排除
The detective on the case,jake moreland, Ruled that out because of the first two victims.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,190
第一個受害者Mike O'Donnell 死於一餐廳男廁的洗手盆下面
The first victim,mike o'donnell,was found Under a sink in the men's room at a restaurant.

41
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,210
什麼樣的餐廳?
What kind of restaurant?

42
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,620
本地餐廳 白桌布 佐餐酒
Local place,white tablecloths and jug wine.

43
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,380
第二個受害者 Karen Lagrassa 是在洗衣店被殺的
The second victim,karen lagrassa, was killed at the laundromat.

44
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,810
三個人都是喉嚨被割開
All 3 had their throats slashe.

45
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,500
拋開辦案手法不說 這些受害者都是隨機的
Aside from m.O.,the victimology's all over the place.

46
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,330
兇手根本不在乎殺的是什麼人 只在乎行兇手段
It's like this guy doesn't care who he's killing, Just how.

47
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,470
並且都是在公開場合 根本不擔心被旁人看見
And he's doing it in public Without compunction for who sees him.

48
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,170
有外貌素描嗎?
Do we have a sketch?

49
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,610
大家都一致的說法 就只有 白種男人 25到40歲之間
All anyone can agree on Is that it's a white male between 25 and 40.

50
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,070
這下好了 範圍縮小到  普羅維頓斯的所有男人
Well,that narrows it down to all of providence.

51
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,360
我們也不能怪目擊者 謀殺實在太血腥了
Hard to fault the witnesses given how bloody these murders must be.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,120
他殺人的間隔越來越短 使我很不安
What bothers me is the cooling off period Is getting shorter and shorter,

53
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,660
他完全不躲藏 不掩飾自己的行為
With no attempt to hide who he is or what he's doing.

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,690
不明嫌犯那麼大膽  很可能正遭受精神崩潰
I mean,an unsub this bold could be suffering from a major psychotic break.

55
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,320
我已經叫Moreland警探調出 最近釋放的犯人和精神病人的資料
I already asked detective moreland to pull recent releases On prisons and mental hospitals.

56
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,640
我們得盡快趕去普羅維頓斯
We need to get to providence asap.

57
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,820
不論是不是精神崩潰  這很可能只是他殺人序幕的開始
Whether he's suffering a psychotic break or not, This could be the start of a spree.

58
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,070
任何人都有可能成為被害者
And anyone is a potential target.

"show me a hero And I will write you tragedy."

61
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,500
美國小說家 F. Scott Fitzgerald
F.Scott fitzgerald.

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,920
他為什麼要用刀?
Why is he using a knife?

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,260
用槍可以殺更多的人
Guns assure the highest number of fatalities.

64
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,450
如果他只關心殺人數量 大可以做得更有效率一點
If all he's interested in is quantity, He could be doing this more efficiently.

65
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,060
他可能是在練手
He could be training.

66
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,100
殺人狂在開始瘋狂行兇前 都會練練手
Spree killers often to dry runs Before they start their rampage.

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,340
大多數殺人狂 一開始殺人就會失去控制 
Most spree killers have lost control by the time they begin.

68
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,140
通常為男性 如果不是什麼校園殺手的話
They're always male. And if they don't fall into the school shooter category,

69
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,870
他們會更老一點 四五十歲 不與別人來往
They're older,40s and 50s, socially isolated.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,900
行兇的導火索 通常是在社會上再也混不下去了
The stressor's usually the dissolution Of their last social outlet.

71
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,350
George Hennard 受James Huberty啟發
George hennard was inspired by james huberty.

72
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,720
兩人在快餐店一共射殺43人
Between the two of them,they shot 43 people at fast food restaurants.

73
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,540
如果他正為大範圍屠殺做準備的話 一定會越來越大膽
Well,if he's practicing for his mass murder, He's definitely getting bolder about it.

74
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,990
也更血腥
And bloodier.

75
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,650
現在 人們的震驚和恐懼正讓他無比享受
Right now,the shock and awe of the bloodletting Seems to be what he's going for.

76
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,350
但很快 他就會感到不滿足
But soon,that won't be enough.

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,230
那這就和他的幻想生活有關了
That makes sense with regards to his fantasy life.

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,910
如果他正計劃什麼大動作 肯定會成天沉浸在想像中
If he is planning something big, He'll spend his day dreaming of it,

79
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,510
在真實和想像中實施著自己的報復計劃
Getting back at slights both real and imagined.

80
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,990
沒有特定的殺人目標
Without a specific target victim,

81
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,610
我們得專注於犯罪現場 發掘有用的信息
We need to concentrate on the crime scenes And see what they tell us.

82
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,860
Prentiss 你負責自助洗衣店
Prentiss,you take the laundromat.

83
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,810
我讓Moreland警探到那兒跟你會合
I'll have detective moreland meet you there.

84
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,330
- 不介意的話 我想去看一下事發教堂 - 好的
- I'd like to take a look at the church If you don't mind. - Good.

85

Jj,you and morgan Interview captain collins' wife.

86
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,510
她最有可能看清不明嫌犯 問問她還記得什麼
She got the best look at the unsub. See what she remembers.

87
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,360

- Agent rossi? - You must be father kendellen.

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,410
謝謝你能及時趕來
Thank you for coming so quickly.

90
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,420
這是我們應該做的 神父
It's the lst we can do,father.

91
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,130
實話說 我一直努力想去理解這一切
To be honest, I've been struggling to understand all this.

92
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,310
這太讓人... 難以接受了
It's been... Trying.

93
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,440
我都不想在教堂門前看到警戒線
I don't like to see crime tape In front of church doors.

94
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,800
難以想像您現在的感受
I can't imagine how you feel.

95
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,680
下周就是聖灰日了 (復活節前的第七個星期三)
Ash Wednesday's next week.

96
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,500
這堛漯糷應該對公眾緊閉的
These doors should never be closed to the community.

97
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,930
說實話 Hotchner警探 他們說BAU要來
To be honest,agent hotchner, When they told me bau was coming,

98
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,490
我想 一定不止兩名探員吧
I expected more than two agents.

99
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,040
其他的探員直接去現場了
The rest of the agents went straight to the crime scenes.

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,580
我相信現場一定有線索 能確定不明嫌犯的下一個目標
I believe there'll be information there That may determine where the unsub will strike next.

101
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,450
請你盡快去洗衣店與Prentiss會合
As soon as you can,I'd like you to meet Agent prentiss at the laundromat.

102
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,230
好 沒問題
Yeah,sure.

103
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,290
能想到下一次行兇會在哪兒嗎? 我們可以派兩班人員加強巡邏
Any idea on where he may hit next? We can double patrols.

104
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,540
老實說 現在還不好確定
It's honestly too early to tell.

105
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,740
你的直覺一定告訴了你什麼
Well,your gut must be telling you something.

106
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,060
目前 他在餐廳洗手間 洗衣店和教堂下手
Well,this far,he's struck at a restaurant bathroom, A laundromat,and a church.

107
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,960
他不是根據自身喜好挑選受害者 只挑有利的環境
He chooses his victims not out of preference, But of favorable circumstance.

108
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,020
每殺一次 他就變得更大膽 這說明他不在乎被別人看到
With each kill he's growing bolder, Telling us he doesn't care who sees him.

109
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,310

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,320
Collins隊長遇害 和上周兩起 被刺案件有沒有聯繫呢?
Is the collins murder tied to the other two stabbings of last week?

124
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,190
警局發佈消息的時候 大家就會知道了 謝謝
And when they are ready to make their statement, They'll let you know. Thank you.

125
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,040
他們在外面一整天了
They've been out there all day.

126
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,530
我的一些朋友本想過來 可都不想上6點的夜新聞
Some of my friends wanted to come by, They didn't want to be on the 6:00 news.

127
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,220
你的丈夫是個英雄
Your husband's a hero.

128
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,430
很遺憾 他的死成為了媒體關注的焦點
Unfortunately, The circumstances of his death Has caused this to be a media circus.

129
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,810
他們就不能表現出一點點的...
Well,you'd think they'd show a little--

130
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,160
我怎麼和你說的 Sophia? 離窗戶遠點
What did I tell you,sophia? Get away from the window.

131
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,140
我們會上電視嗎?
Are we going to be on tv?

132
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,170
我不會讓我們上電視的 去你的房間玩 我一會兒去
Not if I can help it. Go in your room and play. I'll be there in a sec.

133
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,740
我盼了多少年 盼著接到一通電話  或是那種他們親自送來
I spent years waiting for a phone call Or one of those letters they used to hand-deliver

134
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,150
遞交給犧牲戰士妻子的光榮信
To dead soldiers' wives.

135
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,750
他們問我是否想要把Paul埋在 埋在阿林頓國家公墓 但我沒有...
They want to know if I want to bury paul At--at arlington, But I don't have--

136
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,840
好了
Ok.

137
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,750
我知道你們來這兒有工作
I know you have a job to do.

138
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,200
那麼開始吧 就按正確的程序走
Let's do this so it's done right.

139
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,810
Paul也會這麼說的
That's what paul would say.

140
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,210
你們需要瞭解些什麼?
What do you need to know?

141
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,330
兇案就在這媯o生的
It happened right here.

142
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,940
你跟警察說你不知道 不明疑犯什麼時候進來的?
You told the police you weren't sure When the unsub walked in?

143
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,860
是的
Yes.

144
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,960
我不知道
I don't know.

145
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,240
之前他還不在的 突然就出現了
One ment he wasn't there,and then he was.

146
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,760
好吧 我們回顧一下彌撒的過程
All right,let's walk through the mass.

147
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,100
你跟警察說你們去晚了
You told the police that you were late.

148
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,110
在讀聖經的時候 他們進來的
They came in during the first reading.

149
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,410
- 大部分教友長什麼樣 你都記得? - 是的
- You know most of your parishioners on sight? - Yes.

150
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,370
- 但你不認識不明疑犯 對嗎? - 是的
- But not the unsub,right? - No.

151
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,120
我不知怎麼的 沒留意到他
I don't know how I could have missed him.

152
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,530
你跟Collins一家私下挺熟 是嗎?
You know the collins family personally,right?

153
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,920
當然 Paul是在這學校長大的
Of course. I mean,paul,he grew up at this school.

154
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,380
無論他何時回家 他都會來做彌撒
Whenever he came home, he made sure to come to mass.

155
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,910
他們坐在後排 以免打擾其他人?
And they sat there in the back So as not to disturb the mass?

156
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,810
是的
Yes.

157
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,840
他們坐下後 你能看到他們嗎?
Once they were settled, Could you see them?

158
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,220
不能
No.

159
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,650
那麼 神父 你可以釋懷了
Then let yourself off the hook,father.

160
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,170
如果你看不到Collins一家  你也看不到兇手
If you couldn't see the collins family, You couldn't see the killer.

161
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,280
- 不 - 但聖餐的時候 他已經在了?
- No. - But he was definitely there by communion?

162
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,590
- 是的 - 聖餐前不在?
- Yes. - Not before?

163
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,440
- 我不大記得了 - 好吧
- I don't remember. - All right.

164
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,600
Meg 我們可以停一下  如果你想休息的話
Meg,we can take a break If you need to take a break.

165
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,030
怎麼了 寶貝?
What is it,sweetie?

166
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,060
- 我跟他握手了 - 什麼時候?
- I shook his hand. - When was that?

167
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,300
當大家說"祝你平安"的時候  然後大家互相握手
When we all say,"peace be with you" And we shake hands.

168
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,570
然後 我就跟他握手了
I shook his hand.

169
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,390
沒錯 她說的沒錯
That's right. She's right.

170
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,220
在象徵平安的時刻
During the sign of the peace.

171
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,920
他碰了我的孩子 他...
He touched my baby.He--

172
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,830
哦 上帝啊 他...他碰了我的孩子
Oh,god. He t--he touched my baby.

173
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,240
Meg 我知道這對你來說很痛苦
Meg,I know this is difficult.

174
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,730
但是 我希望你能夠集中注意力  再試一下 好嗎? 挺住
But I want you to try and focus. Ok? Stay with me.

175
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,110
我要你告訴我 聖餐過程中發生了什麼
I need you to tell me what happened during communion.

176
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,120
- 我們都站起來了 - 誰第一個站起來的 Paul?
- We all got up. - Who got out first,paul?

177
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,330
是的
Yes.

178
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,110
但他讓我和Sophia先走
But he let me and sophia Go first.

179
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,140
Paul總是走在最後一個
Paul always goes last.

180
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,550
領完聖餐後 我們回到座位 然後我們...
We--we took communion And we--we went back and we,uh...

181
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,380
- 我們... - 沒關係
- We... - That's ok.

182
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,850
我們快結束了 你做得很好
We're almost done. You're doing great.

183
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,460
Paul在你右邊
Paul was on your right.

184
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,400
Sophia在你左邊 然後呢?
Sophia was on your left. What happened?

185
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,000
她自顧自地玩
She was playing.

186
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,900
"聖餐之後 你要祈禱"
And after communion,you pray.

187
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,110
我彎下身 跟她這麼說
I leaned down and I told her that.

188
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,310
所以你一直面向左側  而背對著Paul 背對著兇手
So you were facing to your left,away from paul, Away from the killer.

189
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,030
你沒有看到他怎麼來的  沒有看到他怎麼走的
You never see him coming, you never see him go.

190
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,050
- 我要休息一下 - 好的
- I need a break. - Of course.

191
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,800
我想留在這兒 Meg可能會想起...
I want to stay here. Meg might recall...

192
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,720
更多的東西 即便想不起 她所經歷的一切...
More,and even if she doesn't, What she's going through...

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,070
怎麼了?
What's wrong?

194
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,390
這個不明疑犯沒有精神病  也不會開始大屠殺
This unsub isn't psychotic And he's not gonna go on a spree.

195
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,920
他太有耐心了
He's too patient.

196
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,200
好的 但是... 他想要實現什麼目的?
Ok,but... What is he trying to accomplish?

197
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,760
我不知道
I don't know.

198
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,880
把東西拿出來...
Get the stuff out...

199
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,030
好了 我在疊衣服...
All right,I'm folding...

200
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,150
- 你走近 我沒有聽到 - 你總這樣自言自語麼?
- I don't hear you approaching. - You always talk to yourself?

201
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,660
如果這些洗衣機正在運轉  我肯定聽不到你從背後靠近我
Good. If these machines were on, I definitely wouldn't hear you come up behind me.

202
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,030
Jake Moreland 普羅維頓斯警局
Jake moreland,providence p.D.

203
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,650
Emily Prentiss  好極了 你能再走一遍麼?
Emily prentiss. Great. Can you do that again?

204
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,870
- 當然 - 好的
- Sure. - Ok.

205
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,710
你從後門進來  割了我的喉嚨 走了出去
You come in through the back door, Slash my throat,walk out.

206
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,610
房子堨~都沒有監視器
There's no cameras inside or outside of the building.

207
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,450
所有的犯罪現場都一樣
The same is true for all the crime scenes.

208
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,230
這意味著你夠聰明  能把這些都算在你的襲擊計劃之內
Which means you're smart enough to plan for that in your attacks.

209
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,010
卻又夠粗心 斷了你脖子之後 把刀丟在10尺之內
But,careless enough to drop a knife 10 feet After I cut you.

210
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,580
- 但沒留下任何指紋 - 也是
- But you didn't leave any fingerprints. - No.

211
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,860
三個犯罪現場 都是這麼幹的
He did that at all 3 crime scenes.

212
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,240
殺人狂們通常會崇拜自己的兇器
Mass murderers and spree killers, They often fetishize their weapons,

213
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,980
但這傢伙卻拋棄他的兇器 為什麼呢?
But this guy discards his.Why?

214
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,830
只要他想 隨時都能搞到把新刀
He can get a new knife anytime he wants.

215
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,340
軍品店都有買這玩意
They carry these at army/navy stores.

216
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,650
- 這可能是一種引起恐慌的手段 - 怎麼說?
- It could be a scare tactic. - Hoso?

217
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,750
比起槍 美國人更害怕發現有刀子
Americans typically are more terrified By the presence of a knife than a gun.

218
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,040
比如 對大多數強姦受害者來說

219
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,630
如果兇手有槍 他們更可能會大聲呼救
They're more likely to scream out for help if they see a gun,

220
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,090
而如果看到的是刀 則會順從
Whereas they'll comply if they see a blade.

221
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,220
所以 被害者是什麼樣 用什麼兇器 對這個傢伙來說都不重要
So,victimology and murder weapon Aren't important to this guy.

222
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,400
這樣就剩下了什麼呢? 他要襲擊的到底是什麼?
What does that leave? What is he attacking?

223
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,480
就是犯罪現場了
The crime scene itself.

224
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,440
你看見門外的店標了嗎 這家店是什麼時候開的?
Did you see the sign outside when this place was established?

225
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,820
- 1967年 - 跟那家餐館一樣
- 1967. - The same as the restaurant.

226
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,550
意大利館子傳到第二代了
Second generation italian.

227
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,530
這社區的人都去那埵Y東西
Everyone in the neighborhood eats there.

228
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,340
聖阿爾維納教堂是上世紀初建的
St.Alvina's was built at the beginning of the last century.

229
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,440
三處現場 在這個社區堻ㄕ鳥史
So each location has a history in this community.

230
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,690
這麼說 他希望毀掉地標 毀掉普羅維頓斯的一部分歷史
So he wants to destroy landmarks, Pieces of providence's history.

231
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,670
所以才隨機選擇受害者 這才是他的意圖
That's why the random victims. He's making a point.

232
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,670
很可能是對這個城市 極深怨恨的一種表現
Probably the manifestation Of a deep hatred for the city.

233
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,160
他要在所有人都知道 都會去的地方留下傷痕
He wants to scar the places Everybody knows and goes to.

234
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,170
也不盡然 跟我走
Not quite. Take a ride with me.

235
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,180
- 我們去看看其他的犯罪現場 - 為什麼?
- We're gonna have a look at the other crime scenes. - Why?

236
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,500
就依我的吧
Indulge me.

237
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,080
襲擊一處公共設施 所有人都會有反應
Attack an institution,everybody responds.

238
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,530
左鄰右舍的人都出來了 市長也會部署額外的警力
Neighbors come out, the mayor assigns extra cops.

239
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,160
一個敬神的地方 成了犯罪現場 於自身感情而言 也像是遭到了侵犯
A place of worship turns into a crime scene, You feel personally assaulted.

240
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,180
這正中他下懷 公正的反應 公眾強烈的呼聲
That's what gets him off. The response. Public outcry.

241
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,040
他想要把事情搞大
He wants the big show.

242
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,520
你覺得他會重訪犯罪現場?
You think he's revisiting the crime scenes?

243
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,820
不只是重訪 是重新體會
Not just revisiting. Reliving.

244
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,070
他找到了一種方法 能使自己的兇案 永遠"新鮮" 因為這是留給城市的傷疤
He's found a way to keep the murders he's committed Fresh because they're always on the city's mind.

245
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,400
目擊者說都沒看到案發過程
"witnesses say they didn't see it happen,

246
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,850
是聽到受害者妻女的尖叫聲 才注意到的
Were alerted by the screams of the victim's wife and daughter."

247
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,280
在教堂 活生生地滅口
Man alive,in a church.

248
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,190
這傢伙 簡直膽大包天了
This guy,he ain't afraid onothin'.

249
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,580
有什麼要帶的嗎? 我要去抽根煙
Need anything? I'm gonna grab a smoke.

250
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,160
當心Connie 那玩意會要你的命的
Careful,connie,those things'll kill ya.

251
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,060
<i>普羅維頓斯警署社區分局</i>

252
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,590
小心 那很燙
Careful,it's hot.

253
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,910
真好 我很愛熱茶喲
Oh,good. 'cause I love my tea really warm.

254
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,480
想在你的茶堣]加點奶油和糖嗎?
Would you like some cream and sugar with your tea,too?

255
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,740
請
Please.

256
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,920
Tuffet小姐也愛這麼喝茶
That's how miss tuffet likes her tea,too.

257
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,920
謝謝你
Thank you.

258
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,440
很好喝
It's good.

259
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,920
但我覺得Sophia的茶要更好喝一點
But I think sophia's tea is a little bit better.

260
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,170
謝謝
Thank you.

261
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,240
你有幾個?
How many do you have?

262
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,540
你配合得這麼好 不可能不是個當媽的人
You're too good at this not to be a mom.

263
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,180
一個 男孩
One. A boy.

264
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,650
Sophia第一次聖餐本來應該在下周的
Sophia's first communion is supposed to be next week.

265
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,710
她會做得很好的 不好意思
She'll do great. Excuse me.

266
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
嘿 Rossi
Hey,rossi.

267
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,470
我們準備好馬上要給出側寫了 但我有點事情需要你做
We're just getting ready to deliver the profile, But I need you to do something.

268
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,660
我明白
I understand.

269
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,940
好的 嗯 要是有進一步發現 給我打電話 再見
Ok,uh,call me when you find out more. Bye.

270
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,050
Sophia 媽媽跟Jareau探員 要單獨待會 好嗎?
Sophia,mommy and agent jareau need some privacy,ok?

271
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,850
- 謝謝你的茶 - 不客氣
- Thank you for the tea. - You're welcome.

272
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,480
我明白那個語氣
I know that tone of voice.

273
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,580
接下來總會跟著壞消息
It's always followed by bad news.

274
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,710
你該知道 有很多這種人 需要覺得自己很強大
You should know a lot of these guys need to feel powerful.

275
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,960
製造公眾事件 能夠賦予他們某種驕傲的感覺
Producing a spectacle gives them that sense of pride.

276
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,780
我在試著通過控制 外面的媒體來消除它
I'm trying to quell that by controlling the circus outside.

277
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,770
他在看著我們嗎?
Is he watching us?

278
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,700
也許 我們認為他會重訪他的作案現場
Maybe. We think he revisits his crime scenes.

279
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,080
媒體很有可能會把他吸引過來
It's possible the media could have brought him here.

280
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,900
如果他真的來了 不會是來和我女兒握手的
He won't shake my daughter's hand this time if he does.

281
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,990
我們建議警方將不明嫌犯 作為縱火犯看待 而非割喉殺人犯
We suggest that youve think of this unsub Not as a slasher but as an arsonist.

282
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,130
因為他所獲得的滿足感 並非來自實施犯罪的實際行動
Because the gratification he's getting Isn't from the physical act of murder

283
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,990
而是公眾對此的反應
But from the public's reaction to it.

284
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,350
縱火犯通過縱火 將關注轉移到自己身上
Arsonists draw attention to themselves Through the fires they set.

285
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,620
他們選擇的地點 對自身具有很強的象徵意義

286
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,070
這個不明嫌犯永遠不會真正縱火 卻和縱火犯有著相同的心理
While this unsub will never set an actual fire, He has the same psychosis as one who does.

287
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,360
我們的不明嫌犯符合那個模式
Our unsub fits that model.

288
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,830
他選擇的作案地點 都是社區的重要地段
His locations have been pillars of the community.

289
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,820
殺誰並不那麼重要 而在大家最愛的 餐館外 或做禮拜的地方行兇
The victims he picks aren't as important as the effect Of killing them

290
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,950
所造成的影響才是最重要的
outside of your favorite restaurant Or place of worship.

291
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,320
他選擇目擊者著最多的地方
By picking locales wit the highest visibility,

292
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,750
那麼散播的恐懼也達到了極限
He's creating the highest level of fear in that neighborhood,

293
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,920
這樣更強化了他強大的自我感覺
Which reinforces his feeling of power.

294
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,940
雖說這樣 但縱火犯並不以傷害為目的
Yeah,but arsonists don't set out to hurt people.

295
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,160
- 這傢伙卻以此為目的 - 沒錯
- This guy clearly does. - That's true.

296
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,650
該不明嫌犯絕對屬於 反社會性格類型
And this unsub Definitely falls in the category of sociopath.

297
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,660
受害者只是他完成任務的必要犧牲品
His victims are there only to achieve his goal.

298
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,160
他並不會對他們產生同情
He doesn't have the ability to empathize with them.

299
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,620
對他來說 他們僅僅是他的工具 和一罐汽油一支火柴沒什麼區別
To him,they're just tools for him to use, No different than a can of gasoline and a match.

300
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,230
等會兒打給你 親愛的 我正在市場呢
I'll talk to you later,sweetie. I'm just at the market right now.

301
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,540
好吧 我也愛你
All right. I love you,too.

302
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,360
但他的殺人手法能給我們啟示
But even how he kills tells us something.

303
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,410
從視覺上而言 割喉是髒亂的行為
Slashing a throat is a messy,visual act.

304
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,380
純粹是為了吸引注意 就如一場大火
It's designed to create attention, Just like a fire.

305
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,170
縱火犯通常是使命型的
Arsonists are often ssion based.

306
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,810
他們需要確認上一場火燒盡了 才進行下一場縱火
They need make sure their first fire has burnt out Before they set another one.

307
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,260
- 這些是有機的嗎? - 是的
- Are these organic? - Yeah.

308
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,120
我記得後面的推車媮晹酗@束更新鮮的 稍等一下
You know,I think I have a fresher bunch of those Back in the truck. Holdn one second.

309
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,450
他們高度遵守紀律 非常專心
They're also highly disciplined and focused.

310
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,110
如果環境不適宜縱火 或對此兇手而言 不適宜割喉 他們會繼續等待
If conditions aren't right to set a fire, Or in this case,slash a throat, they'll move on.

311
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,590
不好意思 沒有了
You know,I'm sorry,I don't.

312
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,630
但今天真是你的幸運日呢
Which actually makes this your lucky day.

313
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,410
如果想要點其他什麼 這些繡球花再適合不過了
If you want to get something else, These hydrangeas are perfect.

314
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,920
它們正需要主人呢 我半價賣給你
They have to go home with somebody. I'll give them to you for half.

315
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,570
真的很美 就要這個了
They're beautiful. absolutely,I'll take them.

316
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,420
藍色就像你的眼睛一樣美 怎麼樣?
Blue for your eyes. How about that?

317
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,220
儘管他需要殺人 他知道自製
In addition to his need to kill, He has self-control.

318
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,260
他會有一段冷靜期 因為他十分享受所作所為
He has a short cooling off period Because he's enjoying what he's doing.

319
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,160
這反過來滿足了他的自我 讓他更好地掩蓋罪行
This in turn feeds his ego And keeps him covering his tracks.

320
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,110
也就令他更加危險
This makes him even more dangerous.

321
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,410
如果他感覺沮喪 遇到太多障礙
If he gets frustrated, encounters too many obstacles,

322
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,360
或者他的自戀遭到打擊 他可能開始瘋狂屠殺
Or suffers a blow to his narcissistic ego, he could go on an all-out rampage.

323
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,940
注意待業的人
Focus on men between jobs.

324
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,000
他正在尋找下一個作案地點 而非繼續工作
Instead of working consistently, He is hunting at his next location.

325
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,390
他會重遊案發地 我們建議你們...
and he's revisiting his old scenes.We recommend you--

326
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,680
喂
Yeah.

327
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,610
記者們離開Collins家了
The news crews are leaving the collins house.

328
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,700
- 他又作案了 - 是 第三街和謝爾比街的農貿市場
- He's killed again. - Yeah. Farmers market at third and shelby.

329
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,980
媒體已經趕去了
The press are already on their way.

330
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,820
我們能利用這一點 這能滿足他的自我意識 他會留下觀察的
We could use that. It'll feed his ego. He'll want to stay and watch.

331
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,240
各位 到達犯罪現場後 我需要大家仔細檢查人群
Ladies and gentlemen, when you get to the crime scene, We need you to canvass the crowd.

332
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,520
特別留意那些對現場更感興趣 不關心受害者的圍觀者
Pay particular attention to onlookers who might be More interested in the scene itself than the victim.

333
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,910
給每個人照相 抱歉
And get photographs of everyone. Excuse me.

334
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,210
JJ 我需要你過去
Jj,I need you there.

335
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,340
不 Hotch 我... 我不能走
No,hotch,I-- I can't leave.

336
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,300
JJ你要去控制媒體
Jj,you're there to control the media.

337
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,500
他們過去報道犯罪現場了 這會令不明嫌疑犯分心的
They've left to cover the crime scene, Which may distract the unsub.

338
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,190
我們能抓住他的 現在需要你去掌控那些媒體
We can catch him, but I need you on top of the press

339
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,920
確保它們關注的是我們的目標 而非不明嫌犯
Making sure they're focud on our goals and not the unsub's.

340
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,830
- JJ - 好吧 我馬上就去
- Jj. - Yeah. I'm on my way.

341
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,950
我很抱歉
I'm so sor.

342
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,100
沒關係 我也理解這種語氣
It's ok. I know that tone of voice,too.

343
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,500
- 有人死了嗎? - 哦 我的上帝
- Somebody died? - H,my god.

344
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,160
怎麼了?
What happened?

345
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,400
我猜是那個刺客
I bet it was that stabber.

346
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,530
刺客? 什麼刺客?
Stabber? What stabber?

347
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,160
那個在鎮上到處割人喉嚨的傢伙
You know,the y who's been cutting People's throats open around town.

348
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,430
是啊 那傢伙
Right. Him.

349
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,160
- 請和我來一下先生 來吧 - 怎麼了? 什麼?
- Come with me,sir.Come on.Come on. - What? Wait,what?

350
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,120
我們走 普羅維頓斯警局的
Let's go. Providence pole.

351
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,800
說吧 Emily
Go ahead,emily.

352
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,720
嘿 Rossi 我在這兒發現一串血跡 但是還沒找到刀
Hey,rossi,I got a trail of blood here, But I haven't found the knife yet.

353
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,130
他逃跑了 看看血跡在哪兒中斷的
He ran away. See where it ends.

354
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,200
明白
Got it.

355
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,700
- 我們不能在當地播放這些 - 播放? 早就報道完了
- We can't run this locally. - Run? It's ran,it's gone.

356
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,440
- CNN在3小時內登做頭條了 - 把影響降到最低
- Cnn's leading with this in 3 hours. - Minimize his impact.

357
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,700
不要給他取綽號 這樣只會鼓勵他殺得更多
Do not give him a name. It'll just encourage him to kill more.

358
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,240
這是讓我們 全程跟蹤報道的交換條件?
Am I making this deal for full access?

359
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,300
當然
Of course.

360
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,970
只要稱讚當地警方的工作 忽略我們
Just attribute the good work to the providence p.D.And leave us out of it.

361
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,270
他是個在這兒工作的好人
He was just a nice guy who worked here.

362
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,890
我以前見過他 但從沒買過他的東西
I'd en him here before but never bought anything from him.

363
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,390
關於襲擊你還記得什麼?
What do you remember about the attack?

364
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,160
我問他 這些花是否是有機種植的
I asked if his flowers were organic.

365
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,500
我轉身 接下來就我就感覺到 一些熱熱的東西 是血
I turned away,and the next thing I know I felt something warm. It was blood.

366
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,370
你看見持刀的人了嗎?
Did you get a look at the guy with the knife?

367
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,060
我看見的第一個人是呼救的人 他試圖去止血
The first person I saw was a guy screaming for help And he was trying to stop the bleeding.

368
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,310
一群人跑過來幫忙 我想我當時只是站著尖叫
A bunch of people ran over there trying to help, And I think I just stood there screaming.

369
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,950
往回說一點 是誰在呼救?
Back up for a second. Who was shouting?

370
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,550
我不知道 一個小伙子
I don't know,some guy.

371
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,800
當我轉過身來 他正扶著那可憐的人 試圖引起大家注意
When I turned around, he was holding the poor man up, Trying to get someone to notice.

372
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,590
這傢伙身上肯定有很多血 對嗎?
This guy must have got a lot of blood on him,yeah?

373
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,320
是的 我想是當然的
Yeah,sure,I guess.

374
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,230
好的 謝謝你 警官
All right,thank you for your time. Officer.

375
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,080
說吧 Emily
go ahead,emily.

376
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,450
- 我找到血跡終止的地方 - 然後?
- I found out where that blood trail ended. - And?

377
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,470
不明嫌犯換了衣服
The unsub changed his clothes.

378
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,910
他把血浸透的衣服扔在垃圾箱
He left his bloo d-soaked ones here in the trash.

379
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,700
他開始避免沾血上身 發生什麼事了?
He's avoided getting blood on himself up to now. What changed?

380
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,410
我也不知道 但無論如何 他是有預謀的
I don't know,but whatever his reason, He came prepared.

381
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,100
他知道這次會有很多血
He knew he would be bloody this time.

382
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,450
我待會打給你 你那兒怎麼樣 Morgan?
I'll get back to you. What do you got,morgan?

383
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,360
一位目擊者說 第一個做出反應的人 是一位市民 刺殺後大概2秒就開始呼救
A witness says the first responder,a citizen, Cried out for help maybe 2 seconds after the stabbing.

384
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,200
- 他就是不明嫌犯 - 我也這麼認為
- He was the unsub. - I think so.

385
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:22,020
他不再滿足於重訪犯罪現場了 他想要成為現場的一部分
He's not content with revisiting the crime scene anymore, He needs to be part of them.

386
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,380
- 警探 - 是的
- Detective! - Yeah.

387
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,150
市場周圍進行封鎖
Establish a perimeter around the market.

388
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,860
每20英尺要保證有你的人
Put your men no more an 20 feet apart.

389
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,810
每個警察都要在彼此視線之內
Every cop needs to be in sight of one another.

390
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,940
稍等 怎麼回事兒?
Whoa,wait a minute. What?

391
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,920
- 不明嫌犯還在這兒 - 你肯定嗎?
- The unsub is still here. - Are you sure?

392
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,100
先把男女分開
Start by separating the men from the women.

393
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,460
我們發現了丟棄的衣服 靠這個來找他
We found discarded clothes. That's how we find him.

394
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,320
- 我們按體型核對 - 好的 馬上就去 Gardella 快來
- We match by body type. - All right,I'm on it. Gardella,come on.

395
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,310
收到
Copy that.

396
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,200
Connor 是你嗎?
Connor,is that you?

397
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,060
- 嘿 Liddy - 你去哪兒?
- Hey,liddy. - What are you going?

398
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,700
我要回餐廳了
I gotta get back to the diner.

399
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,440
你得遲到了 所有人都要留在現場
Well,you're gonna be late. We gotta detain everyone inside here.

400
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,430
不是吧 那不就沒人做漢堡了?
Oh,come on. How many hamburgers have let slide?

401
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,000
聽話 夥計 走吧
Just following orders,buddy. Let's go.

402
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,140
我遲到的話你得跟Sal解釋
You gotta explain to sal when I'm late.

403
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,000
行了 你的客人不會餓死的
Yeah,yeah,your customers won't starve.

404
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,000
這也得貼在板子上嗎?
Those gotta be on the board,too?

405
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,520
FBI又出了個好主意啊
What's the next great bit of advice from the fbi,huh?

406
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,840
別這樣 Gardella 生氣也得分時候
Take it easy,gardella. This ain't the time or the place.

407
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,370
要是不聽他們的 Liddy這會兒還能和我喝咖啡呢
If we hadn't listened to them,liddy and I would be havg our morning cup of coffee.

408
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,710
我們推測他是以任務為指引的 這次殺戮不符合這個模式
We profiled that he was mission oriented, And this kill doesn't fit that pattern.

409
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,020
殺害Liddy警官明顯違背了常規
The murder of officer liddy is a significant departure

410
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:57,040
儘管這個不明嫌犯很反覆無常
Even for someone as unpredictable as this unsub.

411
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,300
這是出於自衛本能的謀殺 為了脫身
This was a murder of self-preservation, just to get away.

412
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,300
地點也不是慣常所選 沒人圍觀
This location is not his m.O., Secludedwith no audience,

413
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,820
- 刀刺 而不是刀割 - 所以呢?
- stabbing,not cutting. - So?

414
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,250
所以他現在在街上尋找下一個受害者
So he's out prowling the streets right now Looking for another victim

415
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,180
然後所有人都會注意他
so the city will pay atteion to him.

416
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,720
你們提供了一系列地點
You've been handed a list of locations

417
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,640
是我們認為會吸引不明嫌犯的
That we think might be of particular interest to the unsub.

418
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,910
你們需要在這些地方加強警力
We're asking you to double and even triple your surveillance in these areas.

419
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,110
多留點神 兄弟們
Keep your wits about you,guys.

420
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,870
- 警探 我們有話跟你說 - 好的
- Detective,we'd like to speak to you. - Sure.

421
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,540
就這樣吧 夥計們 謝謝
That's it,fellas. Thank you.

422
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,890
警探 這件事和Liddy警官有關
Detective,the story has become about officer liddy.

423
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,250
我們得把注意力放回不明嫌犯身上 不然他恐怕會失控
We need to get the attention back on the unsub Or we're afraid that he may lash out.

424
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,660
目前為止 不明嫌犯還足夠安分 避免在不當的時機殺人
Up till now,the unsub has been disciplined enough To avoid killing if the circumstances weren't right.

425
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,850
就像有人在的時候縱火犯不會放火
Like an arsonist who won't set a fire if there's someone there

426
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,300
以免煙從窗口冒出來的時候被發現
To see him leaving while smoke is billowing out the windows.

427
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,110
要是有棟樓沒有著火呢?
What if we say that one of the buildings didn't burn?

428
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,100
不明嫌犯會作何反應?
How would the unsub react to that?

429
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,420
他必然會故地重遊 再去縱火
He'd be compelled to come back and finish the job.

430
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,870
那我們就選一處之前的罪案現場 讓他看到公眾聚集在那
Then we pick one of the previous locations, Show that the community has rallied around it,

431
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,300
並不怕他

432
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:02,400
那我們要找個對他來說 最有象徵意義的地方
So we need to find a location With the greatest symbolism up to this point.

433
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,340
很簡單
That's easy.

434
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,510
我們以城市故去的英雄激勵大家
And we use the city's fallen hero As inspiration.

435
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,300
要找警長或者市長發表聲明嗎?
Should we get the chief of police or the mayor To make a statement?

436
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,890
那樣更能鼓舞人心
It could help with inspiring people.

437
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,770
我們有更好的選擇
We've got something better.

438
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,130
Collins上尉的遺孀
Captain collins' widow.

439
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,410
我不能要求她做這種事
I--I cannot ask her to do that.

440
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,880
她很受關注 全城的人都會同情她
She's highly visible,and she's someone With whom the entire city can sympathize.

441
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,620
如果她讓城堣H克服恐懼到教堂去 不明嫌犯不會忽略這一點的
When she tells the city not to be afraid to come back to church, The unsub can't ignore that.

442
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,490
要是這麼做 引得不明嫌犯去找Meg呢?
And what happens if this draws the unsub to meg?

443
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,800
我們會和她在一起
We keep her with us.

444
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,250
我們會抓住那個混蛋
We'll take the bastard down.

445
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,680
- 你想讓我對著鏡頭念這個? - 是的
- You want me to read this, In front of cameras? - Yes.

446
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,000
殺害我丈夫的兇手也會看到?
Will my husband's killer be there?

447
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,490
很可能他會在電視上看到
Most likely he'll watch it on tv.

448
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,830
會有警察時刻保護你
You'll have police protection around you at all times.

449
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,720
不 我不幹
No. I won't do it.

450
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,850
Meg 拜託了 我們需要你
Meg,please. We need you.

451
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,740
你代表了Paul的記憶
You represent paul's memory.

452
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,530
我代表著Sophia Paul已經犧牲了 我也付出了很多
I represent sophia. Paul's given enough. So have I.

453
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,440
是的 我知道了 謝謝
Yes,sir. No,I understand. Thank you.

454
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,890
是市長 他說他不會批准 在聖阿爾維納教堂召開發佈會
That was the mayor. He won't sign off on a press conference At st. Alvina.

455
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,080
JJ也沒能說服Meg Collins
And jj couldn't make any headway with meg collins.

456
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,580
Liddy警官遇刺是什麼時候的事?
How long has it been since officer liddy was stabbed?

457
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,960
16小時以前
16 hours.

458
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,620
如果不明嫌犯出去瘋狂行兇 他現在應該已經得手了
Well,if the unsub was going to go out on a spree, He would have done it by now.

459
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,500
為什麼他還沒得逞?
Why hasn't he?

460
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,550
- 他殺了一個警察 他在避風頭 - 有可能
- He killed a cop. He's laying low. - May be.

461
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,350
但是我們的側寫說他更像縱火犯
But we've profiled this guy like an arsonist.

462
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,400
重要的是後果 不是過程
It's the aftermath that matters, not the act.

463
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,960
你是說他轉而滿足於警方的悲痛?
You think he's feeding off the grief of the police department instead?

464
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,140
這樣一來 他就有了新的目標
If so,then he's found something new to get off on.

465
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,580
- 警探 - 稍等 怎麼了?
- Detective. - Hold on a second. Yeah?

466
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,330
我需要一份名單 列出你們的警員聚眾的地方
I need a list of establishments Where your officers socialize--

467
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,680
比如酒吧 餐館 檯球廳 只要能想到的
Bars,restaunts,pool halls, everything you've got.

468
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,970
沒問題 Eddie 我等會兒打給你
Sure,right. Eddie,let me get back to you.

469
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,880
- 再來一杯 夥計們? - 好吧 反正下班了
- Another round,guys? - Yeah. We're off the clock anays.

470
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,640
兄弟們 這杯是為了Liddy
One more for liddy,boys.

471
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,540
致偉大的警察
Here's to a great cop.

472
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,660
我們會替你抓住那小子的 Joe
We'll get this bastard for you,oe.

473
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,970
FBI會幫你們嗎?
Yeah,the fbi gonna help you do that?

474
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,320
不用側寫也知道我們找的是什麼人
We don't need a profile to know the kind of gu we're dealing with.

475
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,040
一個懦夫
A coward.

476
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,050
他趁黑捅死一個警察 然後逃之夭夭
He stabs a cop in the dark And runs away like a vermin.

477
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,260
- 沒種 - 別逗了
- Gutless. - No kiddin'.

478
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,650
同志們 我找到很多警察的好去處 還有用工記錄
Comrades,I have amassed employment records for police hangouts.

479
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,010
- 要查什麼? - 白種人 男性 25到30歲
- What do you want me toook for? - White males 25 to 30.

480
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,360
忒少了吧
I'm gonna need more than that.

481
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,740
縱火犯通常與母親關係更親密
Arsonists typically have a stronger relationship With their mothers than their fathers,

482
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,030
查查單身母親的家庭 有過虐待 離異 或者家庭暴力
So let's look for single-mother households With a history of abuse, bad divorce,or paternal violence.

483
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,240
Garcia 兒子的記錄也要查 比如進過少管所 小偷小摸
Manifestations in the son,too,garcia, Like juvenile arrests,heavy crimes,

484
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,790
- 還有成績明顯下降 - 謝了寶貝兒 這還差不多
- A significant drop in grades. - Thank you,boys. That will do.

485
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,770
我看就是他了
Oh,this looks like something.

486
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,690
找到什麼了?
What do you have?

487
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,170
Connor O'Brien 他的父親被捕入獄
Connor o'brien.His dad went to prison for--

488
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,650
天吶 他不只放火燒了孩兒他媽的住處
Oh,lordy--not only setting mom's apartment on fire

489
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,050
還偽裝成意外事故 以獲取保險
But making it look like it was an accident So he could collect on the insurance.

490
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,810
為了幾毛錢殺了孩子的母親?
Rned his kid's mother for a few bucks?

491
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,770
Connor出庭作證了 他那時才十歲
Yeah. And then connor testified. He was 10.

492
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,490
O'Brien現在在哪兒?
Where's o'brien now?

493
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,260
他在Quality咖啡館工作

FBI Connor O'Brien在哪兒?
Fbi.Where's connor o'brien?

497
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,790
知道他去哪兒了嗎?

498
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,770
抽煙去了吧 怎麼了?

Did you talk to him about the recent mders?

503
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,070

Of course. We said we'd catch the coward.

504
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,760
- 你鄙視他了 - Admiral街1121號 16號房
- You disparaged him. - 1121 admiral,apartment 16.

505
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,020
在城市的另一邊
It's the other side of town.

506
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,170
Dave 你和Morgan跟 Prentiss還有特警隊到嫌犯家會合
Dave,you and morgan meet prentiss and s.W.A.T.On site.

507
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,760

508
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,300
沒人!
Clear!

509
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,690
他不會回來了
He's not coming back here.

510
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,370
他會發起最後一擊
He's gonna make his last stand.

511
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,070
但他還是關心 自己是不是大家最關注的人物
He's still gonna need to know he's foremost on everyone's mind.

512
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,940
過來這邊!
Guys!

513
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,540
他收集了所有關於他母親之死的報道
It looks like he's got every article that was printed About his mom's death.

514
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,990
還有他葬禮上的禱告卡
He has the prayer card from her funeral.

515

生日卡

516
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,870
簽名都是她母親的 沒有他父親的
Look,all of them signed by his mom, not by his father.

517
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,150
看這張照片 絕對是滿腔仇恨
Look at this. That's a lot of hate.

518
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,990
他爸已經進監獄了 所以他不可能殺他爹
His old man is already in prison. He can't attack him.

519
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,430
於是他要毀掉那些 能讓他想起父親的地方
So he goes after the places that remind him of his father.

520
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,710
他跟他父親溝通的方式只能是通過暴力
The only way he can get through to his dad is with violence.

521
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,600
William O'Brien 又名Billy Os
William o'brien,aka billy os.

社交關係很豐富 擅長利用電線短路造成嚴重火災
Was a connected guy who specialized in turning faulty wiring Into a 3-alarm fire.

523
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,880
Connor的證詞 使他因為殺妻被判終身監禁
Because of connor's testimony, He was given a life sentence For the murder of his wife,

524
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,190
但最近被減刑到5年內可申請假釋

- When was the sentence reduced? - One month ago.

526
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,470
正好在兇殺案開始之前 這是導火索
Just before the murders started. There's our stressor.

527
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,850
如果他爸爸已經進監獄了 他為什麼要這樣向他報復呢?
Why would he do this to get back at his father if he's already in jail?

528
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,910
必須有人付出代價
Somebody's gotta pay.

529
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,010
他現在不再弱小了
He's a tough guy now.

530
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,470
醒醒!
Hey,wake up. Wake up!

531
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,730
你媽死了
Your mother's dead.

532
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,020
該走了
Time to go.

533
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,950
- 可是 爸爸你說了我可以... - 我說該走了!
- But,dad,you said I could-- - I said let's go!

534
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,380
沒事的寶貝兒
It's ok,honey.

535
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,180
再等我一下下 我們一會兒就走啦
Just give me one more minute, we'll be out of here.

536
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,830
好的 謝謝你 Eddie
Yeah,thanks,eddie.

537
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,160
媽的
Damn it.

538
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,660
- 是哪? - 一英里外的圖書館
- Where? - Library about a mile from here.

539
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,690
人們發現的時候小寶寶守著媽媽哭呢
Mother was found next to her crying baby.

540
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,030
孩子有事兒麼?
Is the baby ok?

541
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,110
沒事兒 可是現場沒有找到刀子
Not a scratch,but they haven't found the knife yet.

542
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,680
現在他陷在了自己的回憶中 他會不停地殺更多的人
It's his memento now. He won't stop until he's killed As may people as possible.

543
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,480
我們還是應該回到我們最初的計劃 要製造一個他不能拒絕的誘惑
We have to go to our original plan-- Create an event he can't resist coming to.

544
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,640
要讓他相信他還沒有成功
He has to believe he was unsuccessful.

545
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,640
他不會回到自己的公寓了 我覺得他也不會再去犯罪現場
If he won't go bk to his apartment, and I don't think He's gonna revisit the crime scenes.

546
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,520
在圖書館被殺的母親 她已經死了?
The mother from the library? She's already gone.

547
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,020
當場失血過多而死 醫護人員已經沒在搶救了
She bled out at the scene. The emts stopped working on her.

548
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,570
告訴他們繼續搶救
Tell them to keep trying to resuscitate her.

549
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,070
- 可是她已經死了 - 但是不明嫌犯不知道
- But she's dead. - Yeah,but the unsub doesn't know that.

550
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,020
告訴媒體她沒有死 她還在和死神搏鬥
Tell the press she made it, she's hanging on for dear life.

551
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,970
今天晚上組織大家點蠟燭為她守夜
And we organize a candlelight vigil for her tonight.

552
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,170
如果他一定要完成自己的使命 卻發現她還沒死 他會回來殺她的
If he's mission oriented and he thinks she's still alive, He'll have to come back for her.

553
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,160
然後我們就可以抓住他
And we'll be there.

554
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,420
告訴受害人的丈夫這是怎麼回事兒 這樣他不會一頭霧水
Let the husband know what's going on So he's aware.

555
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:47,530
讓媒體都去圖書館  告訴他們現場直播 盡量關注我們的行動
Have the press there. Tell them to go live And to keep the focus on us as much as they can.

556
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,140

We've shifted the public's focus From connor to his victim.

591
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,350
這應該會讓他很生氣 他會有所動作的
That should make him angry enough to show up And try to do something about it.

592
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,550

把他拖下去

608
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,120
真難以置信 他那麼需要關注
It's hard to believe that guy was so starved for attention

609
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,010
他殺了那麼多人 就為了趕上他爹

He said the older police knew to give him a wide berth.

612

613
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,870
成人版的校霸

可是要擊敗父親的方法有很多啊

615
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,330
我就不斷讀各種博士學位
I just keep getting ph.D.S.

616
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,790
一個反社會的人的兒子有可能超過他爹麼?
Does the son of a sociopath ever really have a chance?

617
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,980
O'Brien和他爸爸犯的罪是同一類的
