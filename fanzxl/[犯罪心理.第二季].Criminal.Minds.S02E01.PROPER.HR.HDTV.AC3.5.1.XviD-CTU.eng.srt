00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,400
And you didn't
find that suspicious?

163
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,400
He said a girl's life
depended on it, man.

164
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,400
I wasn't gonna
take no chances
with somethin' like that.

165
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,400
I see, so you're
a humanitarian here then.

166
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, i guess
you could say that.

167
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,300
How much?

168
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,400
Thousand...

169
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,300
cash.

170
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Seriously,
do i need a lawyer?

171
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,300
This guy is
infuriatingly good.

172
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,400
He routed
his ip through
major corporations,

173
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,800
crisscrossed
it through countries,

174
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,000
bounced it
off satellites.

175
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,300
I thought you
already tracked the hacker.

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,700
Did giles's apartment
have that?

177
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
He didn't have
a couch.

178
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
Exactly. Giles was
a smokescreen

179
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
i should
have seen through.

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,400
But now i have
this glorious program i wrote,

181
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,000
tracking the hacker
through his other identity...

182
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
sir kneighf.

183
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,700
"K-n-e-l-g-h-f."

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
That's an odd spelling.

185
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
Do you need something?

186
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,500
Yeah, is
there a database,

187
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
which lists
all the books published
in a given year?

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,100
Individual publishers
have lists,

189
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,400
but i don't think
there's anything
like a master one,

190
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,600
plus it would depend
upon the year,

191
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
because the further back
you go,

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
the less likely there'll
be any database at all.

193
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,100
1963.

194
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,400
Yeah, ok, that
would be an example

195
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,800
of extremely less likely.

196
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,200
Could you
do me a favor?

197
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,500
Type something
into a search engine
for me?

198
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,300
"Never
would it be night,

199
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,200
but always clear day
to any man's sight."

200
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,100
Ok, that's from a poem,
"the parliament of..."

201
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,300
"fowls!"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

202
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,700
Chaucer, my... my mom
use to read me that.

203
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
It's widely considered

204
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,200
as the first
valentine's poem.

205
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,400
Your mom read you
valentine's poems?

206
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,100
Hello, therapy.

207
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,400
Chaucer.

208
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,800
Chaucer,
"parliament of fowls."

209
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Fowls,
"parliament of fowls,"

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
chaucer.

211
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,000
It has to be at least
283 pages long,

212
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
but the poem
has to be longer.

213
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Something published
in 1963.

214
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,000
A butterfly indigenous
to great britain. Why?

215
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Something born, something
from great britain.

216
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,700
Medieval.

217
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Medieval, chaucer.

218
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,600
Chaucer was middle english.

219
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
Middle english spelling
of the word "fowls..."

220
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,100
there was
a contemporary british
author... fowles.

221
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,300
John fowles.

222
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,700
Will you type it
into a search engine?

223
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,300
Uh...

224
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,800
he wrote <i>the magus,</i>

225
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,000
he wrote <i>the french</i>
<i>lieutenant's woman.</i>

226
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,200
Anything in 1963
in great britain?

227
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,600
<i>The collector.</i>

228
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,000
Collector...
baseball cards,

229
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,600
skeleton keys,
music boxes.

230
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,200
These are things
that are collected.

231
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,600
Reid.

232
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,400
Hotchner:
What'd he look like?

233
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,200
I don't really know.

234
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,800
He had a big coat on

235
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
and a hat pulled down
over his face.

236
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,700
So you can't describe
him at all then?

237
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,900
Well, the part of his face
that i could see

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,700
was all messed up.

239
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
It was messed up?

240
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Yeah... scarred,
all burned up.

241
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,000
[Line ringing]

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,900
Gideon: Burn scars.

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Could explain
the trouble moving.

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,300
We know what the book is.

245
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,600
<i>The collector</i>
by john fowles.

246
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,000
You sure?

247
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,600
Not absolutely.
Not until we see
if the code works,

248
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,200
but i have
4 separate libraries

249
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,600
searching
for the 1963 edition
published in great britain.

250
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,900
Well done, reid.

251
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,100
Agent gideon, there's
a call for you on line 2,

252
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
says it's
extremely urgent.

253
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,900
Is there a name?

254
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,500
Sort of. He calls himself
the fisher king.

255
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,300
This could be
the unsub, guys.

256
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,700
Why?

257
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
In mythology,
the fisher king
is the grail king.

258
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,900
"Sir kneighf,"
it's an anagram...

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
for "fisher king."

260
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,600
Fisher king's
at the end
of all grail quests.

261
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,900
Line 2 trapped
and traced.

262
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,300
Gideon.

263
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,300
What i had to do
was not my fault.

264
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Excuse me?

265
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,100
It was distasteful
and barbaric.

266
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,000
Who is this?

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,800
No one else
had to be hurt.

268
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,500
Call yourself
"the fisher king"?

269
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,700
I told you
there were rules.

270
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,500
I'm actually more interested
in exactly how you got
all those burns.

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,200
Remember this
next time you decide

272
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,100
to step outside
my instructions.

273
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,500
Agent greenaway did not
have to die like that.

274
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Daddy?

275
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,000
Doctor: Notify the o.r.
She's bleeding out.

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They're gonna need
4 units of "o"
on the rapid infuser.

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Fight with me here.
Fight.

279
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,800
Fbi, one of my agents
was just brought in.

280
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Agent hotchner,
i am sorry.

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,300
Anderson, where is she?

282
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,500
I got there just
as the ambulance
was leaving.

283
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,700
Where is she,
anderson?

284
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,000
They just took her
up to surgery.

285
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,200
Then she's alive.

286
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
What do we know?

287
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,400
The local p.d. Said

288
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,600
someone forced
her back door

289
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,800
and surprised her
in the living room.

290
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,600
They were probably laying
in wait for her.

291
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,000
After she was...

292
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,300
it appears
she dialed 911 herself
before she passed out.

293
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,700
Why weren't we
notified?

294
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,400
The offender apparently
took her i.d. And gun.

295
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,600
The uniform i talked to

296
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
didn't even know
she was in the bureau

297
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,100
until i arrived on scene.

298
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,400
Get back over there.
This is a federal
crime scene.

299
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,300
Nobody touched anything.
We process it.

300
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,500
Go.
Yes, sir.

301
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,900
[Beep]

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Mrs. Valez,
are you there?

303
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,000
Woman, on speakerphone:
Yes, dr. Reid, i am.

304
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
I have a first edition
of <i>the collector,</i>

305
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,700
published in great britain
in 1963, doctor.

306
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Wonderful.

307
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,600
Mrs. Valez, i'm gonna
read you a set
of 3 numbers.

308
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,900
The first is gonna be
a page number,

309
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,600
the second a line number
on that page,

310
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,600
and the third,
a word number
in that line.

311
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,700
Do you understand me?

312
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,700
Yes, i understand.

313
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,300
All right, the first
is page 222.

314
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,100
Mrs. Valez:
Page 222. got it.

315
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,900
Line 23.

316
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,200
Line 23. got it.

317
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,400
What is the 16th word
on that line, ms. Valez?

318
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
"The."

319
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,700
"The"?

320
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,900

324
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
Does that make sense?

325
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,100
"The path." yeah,
that absolutely
makes sense.

326
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,800
All right, please
go to page 31...

If he left anything,

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,800
a print, a hair,
sweat, anything...

332
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,000
they'll find it.

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
I sent her home,
jason.

334
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,000
This wasn't you.

335
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,900
I should have been
clearer with anderson.

336
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Try morgan
and jj again.

337
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I tried 'em 3 times.

338
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
They're out of cell range.

339
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,100
Well, try 'em again.

340
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,700
I don't want 'em
to hear about this
on the news.

Woman, on p. A: Dr. Bender

Dr. Bender.

343
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
She was 16
when she was abducted.

344
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
She's 18 now.

345
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,700
Her birthday
was in august.

346
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,300
Help me!

347
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,600

in that little cell.

349
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,300
All right,
let's go over this
one more time.

350
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
She took off
for school,

351
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,600
but never got there,
correct?

352
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
Correct.

353
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,800
None of the neighbors
saw her that morning?

354
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,000
It doesn't even appear
that they canvassed at all.

355
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,900
Ok, jj, i need you
to see if the
originating detective

356
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,100
can meet us
at the house

357
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
'cause there's just
something really funky

358
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,900
about this whole
investigation.

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,400
Well, i will as soon

Another puzzle?

365
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200

who shot one
of our agents today,

know my mother,

she may be in danger.

390

Yes.

391
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,000
She's at the bennington
sanitarium in las vegas.

392
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,700
Her name's diana reid.

we can do.

Uh, that was hotch.

No, no, no.
Hotch said not to.

I don't give a damn
what hotch said.

But, derek, he's right.

There's nothing we can do
at the hospital, ok?

417
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,700

the unsub through...

I'm sorry.

426

No, it wasn't your fault.

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
I just missed
you so much.

to me?

430

That's up to you,

That's up to you.

433
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,900
Any word?

434
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,800
No.

435
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,300
I called jj.

436

I told her
that we'd call them

What's all that?

438
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,600
This unsub's
extremely organized.

Sounded truly shocked
that we didn't
follow the rules.

440
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,600
Honestly believed
we would simply listen
to his directions.

441
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,800
He's delusional.

442
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,200
He thinks
he's a mythological king.

443
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,600
But delusion
and this level
of organization

444
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,400
are almost
mutually exclusive.

The shooter wrote
a message on the wall
in blood,

454
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,400
and in one
of the smudges, they
found a whirl pattern.

455
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,800
They made a lift.

456
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
They aren't sure
whether it's enough
to get a hit,

457
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,800
but they are
processing it now.

used to always

It's funny, huh?

464
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,500
Funny?

465
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,100
Should have realized
sooner than that.

466
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
Nobody knows things
like the fact that jj
collects butterflies

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,300
except for me.

468
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
People tell me
their secrets
all the time.

469
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,300
Think it's
'cause they know

470
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,300
i don't have anyone
to betray them to...

471
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,700
except my mother.

472
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,300
I... i tell her
pretty much everything.

473
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't think
anyone would mind.

474
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,200
Do you know that
i write her a letter
every day?

475
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,300
That's nice.

476
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,500
It depends on
why i write her.

477
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,800
What do you mean?

478
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,500
I write her letters
so i won't
feel so guilty

479
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,300
about not visiting her.

All of her things
are still right here.

482
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,000
We kept it all.

483
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,400
Everything that
was in her room,

484
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,900
in case she ever...

485
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
you said there's
a videotape?

486
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,600
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,700
The man who abducted
your daughter
sent it to us.

488
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,500
You're sure
it's rebecca?

489
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,200
Yes, ma'am,
we're sure.

490
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,300
Ma'am i don't
mean to impose,

491
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,200
but we've had ourselves
a really long drive.

I'll come with you,
ma'am.

495
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,100
Oh, certainly. Sure.

496
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
Detective...

497
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,200
i've seen kids missin'
for a decade,

498
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,700
and their rooms look
exactly the way they did

499
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,200
the day that they left.

500
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Parents don't just
pack up their kid's stuff

501
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,900
and put 'em in boxes
in the garage.

502
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,700
Parents don't give up,
ever.

503
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,300
What the hell
is goin' on here?

504
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
This wasn't exactly
a cut and dried missing.

505
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
This rebecca
is no angel.

506
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
She was in trouble,

507
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
a lot of it
all the time.

508
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
What kind of trouble?

509
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,400
Name it.
Dope, vandalism,
theft, truancy.

510
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,200
Nobody even blinked
when she didn't show up
for school that day.

511
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,900
She was a part-time
attendee at best.

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
None of that
was in the report.

513
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,900
And why would it be?

514
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Because it's relevant,
detective.

515
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,500
Look, uniforms filed
the initial report.

516
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,300
Missing persons never
did a supplemental

517
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,200
because the girl
had run away
5 or 6 times before.

518
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,600
She didn't run away
this time, did she?

519
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,100
Oh, yeah,
apparently not.

520
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,600
Nobody even bothered
to look for this girl
for 2 years?

521
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,100
No.

522
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,700
Why? Why was she
actin' out?

523
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,900
Was there
a problem at home?

524
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,000
Was there abuse?

525
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Abuse?

526
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
From the moment

527
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
we treated rebecca
like an angel.

528
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,600
You just said
"brought her
into the house."

529
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,900
When she was
5 years old,

530
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,300
we took rebecca in
as a foster child.

531
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,800
And after
a couple of years,
we adopted her.

532
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,900
Where are
her birth parents?

533
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Something happened
to the whole family.

534
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
Did she
ever talk about it?

535
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,900
I don't even think
she remembered it.

536
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,600
She was
just a little girl.

537
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,300
So her name hasn't
always been bryant.

00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,500
so that she could be
put up for adoption

643
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,600
because there
was no other family.

644

a huge settlement

from the contractors
who built the development.

What?
Somethin' else?

654
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,400
No. It just says here
that, after the father left
the medical hospital,

655
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,500
he spent a few years
at a vegas sanitarium.

Yeah. That's where...

667
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,100
it's right out there
in the bullpen area.

668

00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,100
Yes, just like you wrote
in your letters.

671
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,200
Dr. Jessen gave me
the book you brought.

only you would know.

682
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,500
Do you write about them
in you journals?

683
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,400
My journals are none
of the government's business!

684
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm not
the government, mom.

685
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Well, this certainly looks
like a government office.

Mother, do you write
about my colleagues'
personal lives?

687

Why did you
bring me here, spencer?

688
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,400
I need to ask
you some things

i think you might know.

690
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
A bad man.
He's killed some people,

691
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,900
and he's holding
a girl hostage.

692
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
You think i know
someone like that?

693
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Will you just watch

and see if he sounds
familiar?

695

I had to make sure
i had your complete attention.

I assure you, you will
all understand in the end

why it must be this way.

He was with me
at the hospital.

705
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,500
He's a very emotionally
disturbed man.

of the ip string.

Hotch?
Yeah?

718

The only way for
the organization level
to be so high

719
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,900
is the unsub believes
it's all real.

He believes he's
the keeper of the grail,

722
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,600

make him understand
it isn't real.

723
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,900

724

Whenever he talked
about rebecca,

727
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,100
he never said
she was his daughter.

728
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,700
He said all his children
died in the fire.

729

more in the abstract.

731
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,600
I really thought
she was a metaphor,

732
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,100
not an actual human being.

733

all the clues.

There's nothing that points
to an address.

The adoption records
for rebecca

listed an address
of the fire,

747
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,000
so i made a call

know what state he's in?

00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,800
My name
is dr. Spencer reid
from the fbi.

803
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,990
You were in the hospital
with my mother, diana?

804
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,600
Garner:
If you want the grail...

805
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,900
she's not a grail!

806
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,100
She's your daughter.
Her name's rebecca.

807
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,700
My daughters
died in a fire

808
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,000
and my son
and my wife.

809
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,300
Rebecca lived.

810
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,000
No. Your mother,
she explained
it all to me.

811
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,200
My mother's
a paranoid schizophrenic
who'd forget to eat

812
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
if she wasn't
properly medicated
and supervised.

813
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
She made me realize
none of it was real.

814
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,300
I didn't lose rebecca.

815
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
She... she never existed
in the first place.

816
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,700
She does exist,
mr. Garner,

817
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,900
and we're here
to help her.

818
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Hotch, morgan?

819
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,500
I think maybe
it'd be better

820
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,200
if you guys
waited downstairs.

821
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,600
What?

822
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,500
Mr. Garner and i
are just gonna
talk alone up here.

823
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,700
Morgan:
Go ahead and talk, reid,

824
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,700
but we're not goin'
anywhere.

825
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,200
Ask the question.
I'll be healed,

826
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,800
and you may
take the grail.

827
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,200
Just ask the question,
sir knight.

828
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
I can't.

829
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,900
Heal me!

830
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,600
Mr. Garner,
a fisher king wound

831
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,100
cannot be healed
by somebody else.

832
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,300
It's not a wound
to the body.

833
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,500
It's a wound
to the memory.

834
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Wound to the mind.

835
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,200
It's... it's a wound
that only you can find,

836
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,500
and a wound that
only you can heal.

837
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Just ask the question.

838
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,900
There's only one question
that matters, mr. Garner.

839
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,100
There's only one
really important question.

840
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,500
Can you forgive yourself?

841
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,200
I couldn't
get to them.

842
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,700
If you tell me
where she is,

843
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,900
you can save rebecca now.

844
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,900
Tell me where rebecca is.

845
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You already know.

846
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I sent you
my other map.

847
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
What map?

848
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Can i forgive myself?

849
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,900
No, i can't.

850
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,700
[Beeping]
Run!

851
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,000
[Shouting]

852
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's all right.
It's ok.

853
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,700
Let's go!

854
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,900
[Coughing]

855
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,900
What the hell
was that?

856
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
He had a bomb.

857
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,300
You didn't
think we needed
to know that?

858
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,700
I told you
to go downstairs.

859
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,200
Well, you didn't say bomb.
You left that part out.

860
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,600
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop.

861
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Stop? The house
is on fire, reid.

862
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Let's go!

863
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,900
Just let me think,
let me think!

864
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,100
He's the fisher king,
this is his house,

865
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,600
so rebecca's
got to be here.

866
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,900
Reid, there
may not be time
for a search. Let's go.

867
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,500
Location's on the map
that he gave to my mom.

868
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,200
Reid, all she
told us about
was that photo.

869
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
Let's go!

870
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,600
Down... she's
in the basement downstairs!

871
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
Morgan: How do you
know that?!

872
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
Rebecca!

873
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,200
Is the house
on fire!?

874
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,500
Rebecca!

875
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Unchain me!

876
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,700
Get us
out of here!

877
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,200
Hurry!

878
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,200
He called me
sir percival.

879
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,200
Rebecca: Hurry!

880
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,200
Reid, hurry.

881
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,200
The key. The key.

882
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,200
The youngest one
holds the key.

883
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,200
Tell me
you got the key.

884
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,100
Come on! Let's go!

885
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,000
Let's go!
We got no time!

886
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,200
Get it off!

887
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
You got her?

888
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,100
Come on.
Let's go.

889
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Gideon: "it has been said
that time heals all wounds.

890
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,300
"I do not agree.

891
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,900
"The wounds remain.

892
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,200
"In time, the mind,
protecting its sanity,

893
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,500
"covers them
with scar tissue,

894
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,400
and the pain lessens,
but it is never gone."

895
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,300
Rose kennedy.

896
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,500
Dad, there's something...

897
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
it's ok.

898
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,100
No, i want to say it.

899
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,700
That day...

900
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,600
i was just mad
that day.

901
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,300
I wanted you to teach me
to ride my bike.

902
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,200
I knew that you
had to work.

903
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,900
I was just being
selfish and childish.

904
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
Baby, you were 8.

905
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,000
I said,
"i hate you, daddy."

906
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,700
Those are the last words
that i ever said to you.

907
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,900
Shh. It's ok, baby.

908
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,900
I've thought
so many times
that i wish...

909
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,300
i wish that i had said...

910
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,600
i love you, daddy.

911
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,900
I love you, too,
peanut,

912
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,800
very much.

913
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,400
I can't stay
with you.

914
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,900
That's all right.

915
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Will i ever see you
again?

916
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,000
I'll be here
when it's time.

917
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,500
I love you.

918
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,500
Doctor:
There you are.

919
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,800
You can sleep.

920
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,900
You're
gonna be fine.

921
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,200
Elle's
out of surgery.

922
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
She's gonna be ok.

923
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,300
Good.

924
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,500
Is gideon still
at the hospital?

925
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,500
Yeah.
How's rebecca?

926
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,400
She's in the hospital,
but she should be all right.

927
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,900
Physically, maybe.

928
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Thank you, everyone.

929
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,200
All of you.

930
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,600
Well, we could have
only gone so far
without mrs. Reid.

931
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,200
Mom, we found her.

932
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,700
Rebecca's safe.

933
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,400
You helped us
save her life.

934
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,600
Is it time
for lunch yet?

935
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
What?

936
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,500
I'm lecturing everyone
in tristan and iseult.

937
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,800
They're all gathering
in my room after lunch.

938
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,400
Can i attend
the lecture, too?

939
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,400
Have you read
any of the material?

940
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I've had them
read <i>to</i> me.

941
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,900
Wonderful.

942
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,400
That's the best way,
isn't it?

943
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Yes, ma'am.

944
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,200
