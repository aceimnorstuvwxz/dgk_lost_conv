1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,870
犯罪心理 前情提要
Previously on "criminal minds"...

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,230
局婼頨癟睇熅氻p組的能力
The bureau thinks that my ability to lead this team has been compromised.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,700
這週末我就辭去主管職位
I'm resigning as unit chief at the end of the week.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,320
什麼?
What?

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,100
我不是要離開隊伍 我只是不再當主管
I'm not leaving the team. I'm just no longer in charge.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,020
你來當主管 我?
You are. Me?

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,190
Barnes女士 很遺憾你哥哥被害了
Ms. Barnes,i'm sorry for your brother's death.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,730
我知道這聽起來像客套話 但我真的很抱歉
I know that sounds like something people say, but I truly am sorry.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,310
謝謝你陪我度過這一切
Thank you for helping me through this.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,540
當然
Of course.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,650
我認為你應該和Tamara Barnes斷絕聯繫
I think you need to cut contact with tamara barnes.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,000
Penelope 她失去了哥哥 她只想要答案 我可沒動心
Penelope,she lost her brother. She just wants answers. I'm not involved.

13
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,200
走吧
Let's go.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,720
我們得快點兒 我們已經很快了
We have to hurry. We are.

15
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,420
離門禁只有十分鐘了 我陪你過去
It's 10 minutes before curfew. I'll get you there.

16
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,130
Ben剛剛算啥意思? 只是個輕吻而已
What just happened with ben? It was just a peck.

17
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,690
那是因為你邊上還有人 下次呢
Only because you weren't alone, but next time…

18
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,480
你今晚會給他發短信嗎?
so are you going to text him tonight?

19
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,740
大概吧 應該要發哦
Maybe. Well,you should.

20
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,080
我不知道 我還有作業沒做
I don't know. I have homework to do still.

21
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,590
那又怎樣 我覺得他很可愛
So what? I guess he is pretty cute.

22
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,890
呃 是吧

23
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,020
不!
No!

24
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,830
我不知道 我覺得這算是升職
I don't know,it sounds like a promotion to me.

25
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,060
是啊 這很複雜
Well,yeah,it… it's complicated.

26
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,080
世事皆複雜
What isn't?

27
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,910
嗯 只是這一切發生得太快
Yeah. It's just everything's happened so fast,

28
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,730
我們甚至還沒來得及告訴其他隊員
I mean,we haven't even had a chance to tell the rest of our team yet.

29
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,230
我還是想謝謝你...
You know,i wanted to thank you again for...

30
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,720
能來參加聽證
Coming to the hearing.

31
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,170
我不知道這麼請求你公不公平
I didn't know if it was fair to ask you.

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,060
Tamara 我很樂意幫到你
Tamara,i'm glad I could be there for you.

33
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,520
過去幾周我唯一清醒的時刻
I think that the only time that I have felt sane at all in the past few weeks

34
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,830
就是和你交談的時候
is when i've talked to you.

35
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,770
是嗎? 我...
Really? I...

36
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,030
我覺得只有我一直說個不停呀
I feel like I'm the one who's been doing all the talking here.

37
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,530
你幫我找回了工作的感覺
You've helped me reconnect to my job.

38
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,980
事實上 也找回了我自己
To myself,really.

39
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,200
很高興再次見到你
It's good to see you again.

40
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,080
我也是 見到你太好了
It's really nice to see you,too.

41
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,240
我知道你的新工作責任重大
So,listen, I know that your new job is a lot of responsibility

42
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,080
你會 你也應該付出百分百的精力
and you're gonna have to commit a hundred percent, and you should.

43
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,600
但一旦事情步入正軌了 不如我請你喝東西? 這樣公平了吧?
But maybe when things calm down, i'll buy you a drink? Fair?

44
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,440
好 太公平了
Yeah. It's more than fair.

45
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,590
還有 我要給你點東西
Also,i wanted to give you something.

46
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,040
這是William的 我不能拿
It was william's. I can't take this.

47
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,220
我要你收下 拜託 謝謝你陪伴我
I want you to have it. Please. For being there for me.

48
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,200
如果你像我這樣失去了哥哥 有一個像你這樣的人在身邊 會好很多
When you lose a brother the way that I did, it's nice to have someone like you at my side.

49
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,090
有人能給我解釋下為啥Hotch被降職了?
So,did anyone explain why hotch is stepping down?

50
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,020
Morgan今早就告訴了我們結果而已
All morgan said this morning is that it's happening.

51
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,010
一切事務都照常進行
And it's business as usual.

52
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,030
所以我們應該啥也不說就繼續工作?
So we're just supposed to move forward without any discussion?

53
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,910
出了Foyet這事 我想我們得準備好面對一切
After foyet,i think we'd have to be ready for anything.

54
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,130
選好案件了嗎?
Did you pick a case?

55
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,130
我和Jareau探員今早看了所有申請 我決定調查俄克拉荷馬城的案件
Agent jareau and I reviewed the requests this morning, and i've decided on oklahoma city.

56
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,740
為什麼挑這個?
Why this one?

57
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,310
其他的案件 當地警方都多少掌握了證據
Locals have more evidentiary information in other priorities.

58
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,060
這一件 什麼也沒有 他們最需要我們
This one,they have nothing. They need us the most.

59
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,950
很好
Good.

60
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,880
如果您沒有問題了 我想叫隊員們開會
If that's all, i'd like to gather the team.

61
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,590
我去登記 希望隨時向我匯報
I'll be checking in. I expect to be briefed.

62
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,320
好的 長官 如果你想要隱私 可以用我的辦公室
Yes,ma'am. If you need privacy, please use my office.

63
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,530
沒事了 我們談完了
That's ok. We're done here.

64
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,240
等我們回來 我會收拾乾淨 辦公室都歸你了
And when we get back, i'll clear everything out and it'll be all yours.

65
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,950
Hotch 我不要你的辦公室 我同意Hotchner探員的意見
Hotch,i don't want your office. I agree with agent hotchner.

66
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,830
主管需要一個妥當的辦公室
The team leader needs a proper office.

67
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,350
恕我直言 Strauss女士 既然你們兩位都對我接任主管充滿信任
All due respect, ms. Strauss, but both of you have trusted me to step in as acting unit chief.

68
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,140
我請求您尊重我的決定
I'm asking that you respect my decision.

69
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,450
我決定我不需要Hotch的辦公室 那是他的一方天地
I've decided that I don't want hotch's office. That's where he belongs.

70
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,620
如果有需要 我們可以日後再討論此事
If necessary,we can discuss this again at a later date,

71
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,510
但現在 我們真的要開始調查案件了
but right now,we really need to get started on this case.

72
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,340
夥計們 把Rossi叫來
Guys. Grab rossi.

73
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,840
這是Megan Chertow 和她的朋友Bina Sukarto
This is megan chertow and her friend bina sukarto,

74
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,580
都17歲 兩天前的晚上在一車庫被發現 頸動脈被切斷
both 17,found 2 nights ago in a parking garage, carotids severed.

75
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,890
這是John O'heron 61歲
This is john o'heron,61.

76
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,410
四天前在木叢中被發現 頭部被鈍器擊傷而死
He was found dead in a wooded area 4 days ago, blunt force trauma to the head.

77
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,320
行兇方式不同
Different m.O.

78
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,260
被害者背景也完全不同
And completely different victimology.

79
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,350
這些案件是怎麼聯繫起來的? 他們的眼睛都被取走了
How are the cases linked? Their eyes have been removed.

80
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,960
他是個剜眼者 這還有名字?
Oh,he's an enucleator. There's a name for this?

81
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,120
這是一種非常罕見的犯罪行為
It's a rare subset of criminal behavior,

82
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,030
但對於好攻擊的剜眼者 的確有案例研究
but there have been case studies of assaultive enucleators.

83
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,550
他們中的絕大多數都有精神疾病
The overwhelming majority of them suffer from diagnosed mental disorders.

84
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,020
通常是男性 不善社交 殺人都沒有章法又草率
And they're usually males, lack social skills, their kills are disorganized and sloppy.

85
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,480
典型的剜出者挖出眼睛 但一般不會把眼睛帶走
The typical enucleator gouges the eyes out, but he doesn't normally take them with him.

86
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,080
這人帶走了?
This guy did?

87
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,110
我們要搞清楚原因
We need to figure out why.

88
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,460
兩起謀殺間有明顯的轉變
There are noticeable shifts from the first to second murder.

89
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,350
行兇場所從隱蔽之處變成了公共區域
He goes from killing in seclusion to a public place.

90
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,320
被害者也從一個變成了兩個
And he escalated from one victim to 2.

91
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,990
我最擔心的是 兩起案件間隔不到48小時
What concerns me most is there's less than 48 hours between the murders.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,270
所以我選擇了這個案件
That's why I chose this case.

93
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,000
基於我們對剜眼者的瞭解 他們幾乎都會多次重複犯案
And from what we know about enucleators, they're almost always multiple repeat offenders.

94
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,570
正是 也就是說他馬上就會再開殺戒
Exactly. Which means he's going to need to kill again soon.

95
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,520
30分鐘後飛機上見
All right. Let's meet on the plane in 30.

<font color=#DB70DB>Criminal Minds Season05 Episode06 The Eyes Have It</font>

97
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,280
"若是你的右眼叫你跌倒 就剜出來丟掉"
"and if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee."

98
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,730
馬太福音 5:29
matthew 5:29.

99
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,130
幾位被害者的眼睛顏色不同
The color of all the victims' eyes are different,

100
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,380
也許這在被害者研究中並不重要了
so that probably doesn't factor in to victimology.

101
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,110
更可能是 他從這些眼堿搢鴗F什麼
It's more likely what he sees in the eyes.

102
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,990
案件研究表明大多數剜眼者都有妄想癥
Case studies show that most enucleators suffer from delusions.

103
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,030
他們聽到聲音 從人們眼堿搢鴘F西
They hear voices and see things in people's eyes.

104
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,940
通常是邪惡的幻覺 他們認為自己的行為是在摧毀惡魔
Usually something evil. They're driven to enucleate to destroy the devil.

105
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,990
這就指向了最近剛從 收容所或精神病院出來的人
It points to someone who may have been institutionalized and recently released.

106
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,620
我叫Garcia去查
I'll have garcia start looking.

107
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,160
好了 告訴我 這些案件有哪些不尋常?
All right,so talk to me. What makes these attacks so different?

108
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,780
第一位被害者頭部遭多重鈍器襲擊 帶了更多個人恩怨
With victim one,there were multiple blunt force strikes to the head… a more personal kill.

109
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,290
他處理了屍體 也許是反偵查手段
And he disposed of the body, maybe as a forensic countermeasure.

110
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,350
第二起謀殺就不那麼個人化了 更投機
The next murders seemed less personal, more opportunistic.

111
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,220
我想我們該查查 為什麼第一個被害者被毆致死
I think we need to look at why the first victim was bludgeoned and dumped.

112
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,320
也許不明嫌犯認識他
Perhaps the unsub knew him.

113
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,970
Prentiss 你去棄屍場地
Prentiss,i want you to go to the disposal site,

114
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,010
查查為什麼他被丟在那兒
see if you can figure out why he was dumped there.

115
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,850
Rossi 我和你去昨晚的罪案現場
Rossi,you and I are gonna go to last night's crime scene.

116
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,240
實際上 兩個女孩的家長說 要和我們的主管談談
Actually,uh, the girls' families asked to speak to our team leader.

117
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,080
好吧
All right.

118
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,180
這樣的話 Rossi 你一個人去現場
Ok,in that case, rossi,you can handle the crime scene solo.

119
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,110
JJ 你跟著我 Hotch Reid 你們去調查John O'heron的生平
Jj,you're with me, and,hotch,reid, I want you to get into john o'heron's life,

120
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,910
看看有什麼能導致私人動機的
see if anything at all points to a personal motive.

121
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,480
<i>{\a6}俄克拉荷馬城警局 俄克拉荷馬州</i>

122
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,230
我是Phil Brantley 謝謝你們能來
Phil brantley. Appreciate you all coming.

123
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,710
我是Hotchner探員 這是Reid博士 團隊其他成員稍後就到
Agent hotchner. This is dr. Reid. You'll meet the rest of the team later.

124
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,030
這個給你 好
Here's one. Excellent.

125
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,400
這兒是發現第一具屍體的地方 就在城外
Ok,here's where the first body was found, just outside of town.

126
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,320
昨晚的謀殺在這
And last night's murders were here.

127
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,690
差了大概22英里
And that's about 22 miles apart.

128
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,460
這不太正常 什麼?
That's unusual. What?

129
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,760
連環殺手的作案範圍一般更小
Serial killers usually have a smaller kill zone.

130
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,820
這是我們的技術分析員 嘿Garcia 我開了免提
It's our technical analyst. Hey,garcia, you're on speaker phone.

131
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,210
我查了最近出院的精神病人 其中有剜眼
So,i looked up recently released mental health patients who have a history of eye gouging,

132
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,980
或攻擊眼部前科 以及其他 對眼睛和眼窩有"特殊"癖好的
eye assault, and other gross things you can do to eyes and sockets.

133
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,980
那媕Y沒有俄城居民
And there's no bingo for okie city residents.

134
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,640
最近有什麼襲擊眼睛的案子嗎?
Any other recent attacks involving assaults on eyes?

135
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,340
九個月前有一起 但不可能 他還在牢
There's one 9 months ago. He's not your guy 'cause he's in jail.

136
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,600
我們一會再打給你
We'll call you later.

137
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,380
明白 招手招手 再見
104,breaker breaker. Bye.

138
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,130
你覺得他剛從精神病院出來?
You think he's fresh out of an asylum?

139
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,150
或者他剛剛從被禁錮的狀態中獲得自由
Either that or he's been held somewhere and he's now free.

140
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,770
我們見過襲擊眼睛的案件 酒吧鬥毆 家庭暴力啥的
We've seen eye assaults before, you know,bar brawls,rage, domestic abuse cases.

141
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,810
但都沒有像這樣
But nothing like this.

142
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,420
他要這些眼睛到底幹嗎用?
What the hell's he doing with the eyes?

143
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,650
也許當成某種戰利品來收集
He could be collecting them as a trophy of some sort.

144
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,300
它們不可能像戰利品那樣長時間保存
They wouldn't keep long as trophies.

145
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,550
眼睛的80%是玻璃體液 本質上就是水
Eyes are 80% vitreous humor, which is essentially water.

146
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,160
幾個小時後就會變得渾濁乾枯
After a few hours,they begin to get cloudy and wilt.

147
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,180
還有別的理論嗎?
Any other theories?

148
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,520
也曾有這樣的案子 挖出眼球後 精神病人會吃掉它們
There have been cases where after enucleation, mental patients have consumed the eyeballs.

149
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,580
你是認真的嗎?
Are you serious?

150
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,480
謝謝你們能來 應該的
Thank you for coming here. It's no problem.

151
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,590
我們不能離開房子 我們要哀悼三天
We can't leave our house. We have to mourn for 3 days.

152
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,300
佛教儀式? 是的
Buddhist rituals? Yes.

153
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,810
你妹妹昨晚出門時打過電話給你嗎?
Did your sister call you while she was out last night?

154
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,890
沒有 我就知道出事了 她總是在門禁前回家
No. I knew something was wrong. She always comes home by curfew.

155
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,790
你見過這男人嗎?
Does this man look familiar to you?

156
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,340
沒有 為什麼這麼問?
No. Why do you ask?

157
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,680
我們相信你妹妹和他 被同一個兇手殺害
We believe he and your sister were killed by the same person.

158
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,260
這能幫我們排除 被害者之間的聯繫
It helps us to rule out any connection between the victims,

159
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,710
看起來你妹妹被殺是個隨機事件
and it tells us that your sister was most likely attacked at random.

160
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,040
謝謝你 謝謝
Oh,thank you. Thank you.

161
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,580
我要求和你們談話 是因為需要你們幫忙
I asked to speak to you because we need you to do something for us.

162
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,030
沒事 慢慢來
It's ok. Take your time.

163
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,250
祖母說她昨晚看到了Bina的魂
Grandma said she saw bina's ghost last night.

164
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,160
她的眼睛就是兩個大黑洞
Her eyes were just big black holes.

165
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,730
Bina在找她的眼睛
Bina was looking for her eyes.

166
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,500
祖母說Bina被詛咒了
She says bina's cursed.

167
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:21,280
她無法安息 她永遠要尋找她的眼睛
She can't rest. She's stuck for eternity looking for her eyes.

168
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,560
我們想火葬她
We want to cremate her.

169
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,720
但我們要全部的她
But we need all of her.

170
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,450
你們能找到她的眼睛嗎?
Can you find her eyes for us?

171
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,050
我們會盡力
We will try.

172
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,370
但現實一點說 不一定能找到
But realistically, we may not be able to.

173
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,970
那她會永遠被詛咒
Then she will be cursed forever.

174
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,990
永不得安息
She may never rest in peace.

175
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,880
O'heron的朋友說他有酗酒嗜好
O'heron's friends say he has a history of drunken behavior,

176
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,570
但他們不知道誰跟他有仇
but they don't know anybody with a grudge against him.

177
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,710
他最後出現是在一個酒吧
He was last seen leaving a bar.

178
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,720
當班的酒保說他是平安離開的
Bartender on duty said he left without incident.

179
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,010
之後他去哪了?
Where did he go after that?

180
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,590
我查了John O'heron被拋屍的地點
I checked out the disposal site where john o'heron's body was dumped.

181
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,300
是條荒蕪的農場路
It's a remote farm road.

182
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,690
不明嫌犯不是碰巧這麼幹的 他知道那
The unsub didn't just stumble on it,he knows it.

183
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,080
我們需要一份 在那附近工作或居住的人的名單
We need a list of people who work or live near the area.

184
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,960
我有種不好的預感 為什麼?
I got a bad feeling about this guy. Why is that?

185
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,670
他選了停車場 說明他很有耐心
He chose that parking garage. He was patient.

186
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,650
他躲起來 等待對的時間地點 以及受害人
He hid and waited for the right victims and the right time and place.

187
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,610
然後閃電攻擊他們 這都是計劃好的
He blitzed them. It was all strategic.

188
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,300
這對一個典型的剜眼者來說太有條理了
That sounds way too organized for a typical enucleator.

189
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,190
而且他作案間沒有冷卻期
Add to that his lack of a coolingoff period between kills,

190
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,070
想搶在他之前很難
it's not gonna be easy to get ahead of him.

191
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,590
我剛和法醫通過電話
I just got off the phone with the m.E.

192
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,940
她說有些東西我們得看看
She says there's something we should see.

193
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,290
眼球由六種不同的肌肉 脂肪組織 和視神經牽制於眼窩中
The eyeball is held in the socket by 6 different muscles, fatty tissue, and the optic nerves.

194
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,460
這是John O'heron的眼窩照片
These are pictures of john o'heron's eye sockets.

195
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,930
看到突出的視神經了?
See the optic nerves protruding?

196
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,760
外傷 是被扯掉的 也許是用手
Trauma. They were ripped out. Maybe with fingers.

197
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,460
現在來對比桌上的屍體看看
Now compare this to my body on the table.

198
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,380
內部平滑 沒有瘀傷 沒有外傷跡象
Smooth inside,no bruising, no sign of trauma.

199
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,170
視神經縮回肌肉 並且邊緣很乾淨
Optic nerves retracted into the muscle and they have a clean edge.

200
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,520
這麼說 是仔細切割出來的
So you're saying these were cut out.

201
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,860
用邊緣鋒利的工具
With a sharpedged tool.

202
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,980
他努力不剪到眼窩或者眼瞼
He managed to avoid cutting the sockets or the eyelids.

203
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,220
這是精細活兒
This was precise work.

204
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,820
只有醫生才能幹?
The kind of work only a doctor could do?

205
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,500
我只是說 這兩個女孩 都切除得異常乾淨
All I'm saying is that with both of these girls, it was a clean excision.

206
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,310
所以 他對第一個很粗魯 對其他的卻很精細
Ok,so he was crude with the first victim, surgical with the others.

207
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,510
他為了挖掉眼鏡廢了太大功夫 肯定不會毀掉它們
The amount of effort he's going through to remove the eyes now, he wouldn't destroy them.

208
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,940
他是要保存起來
He's keeping them.

209
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,870
雖然隱蔽 但仍是公共場所
It's secluded,but he chose a public spot again.

210
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,580
他不怕被抓
He's not afraid to get caught.

211
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,690
這和其他犯罪現場很遠 他為什麼來這兒?
This is far from the other crime scenes. What brought him here?

212
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,150
好吧 他這次只殺了一個
Well,he only killed one person this time.

213
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,370
本可以更多
It could have been more.

214
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,090
嘿 我們在附近找到一輛車
Hey,we found a car parked nearby.

215
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,880
從車管部門的照片上確認了她的身份
I.D.'D her from a dmv photo.

216
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,020
Tracy  Copper 32歲 丈夫說她是慢跑愛好者
Tracy copper,32. Husband said she was an avid jogger.

217
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,370
脖子上一處刀傷 眼睛不見了
Single knife wound to the neck, eyes are missing.

218
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,620
跟上次一樣切得很小心
Cut out as carefully as the last ones.

219
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,640
嘿 Garcia 我們有了本地醫生的名單 但需要再做篩選
Hey,garcia. So we have the list of local doctors, but we need to back it up one step.

220
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,920
我該幹嘛呢 我的小美人?
Where shall I splice, my pretties?

221
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,500
把有違法記錄的醫生名單給我 比如醫療事故訴訟
Give me a list of all doctors who've had infractions like malpractice suits.

222
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,900
好了 接下來呢
Got it. Bouncing your way.

223
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,690
縮小到眼科醫生
Narrow it down to eye specialists.

224
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,230
哇哦 還是有很多名字 那我們瞭解多點再打給你
Whoo,that's still a lot of names. We'll chip away when we know more.

225
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,790
嘿 等等 掛電話之前 我的小Morgan干的怎麼樣?
Hey,wait. Before you hang up, how's my morgan doing?

226
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,360
很好 我當然知道我男人好啦
Fine. I know the man is fine.

227
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,240
我是問他當頭兒當得怎麼樣?
How's he holding up as head honcho?

228
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,020
好吧 他有壓力 但他頂得住
Well,he's stressed, but he's on top of it.

229
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,740
說到這個 你倒是可以為他做點什麼
Speaking of which, there is something you could do for him.

230
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,050
說吧
Name it.

231
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,200
他肯定又是躲在樹叢媯扔
He must have hidden in these trees lying in wait again.

232
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,930
所以他是選了地點後隨機選擇受害人
So he picked his location and then waited for a victim of opportunity.

233
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,970
他突襲她 因為缺乏社交技巧 無法吸引別人
He blitzes her because he lacks the social skills to charm.

234
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,570
感覺跟停車場的那一起如出一轍
That feels like the same pattern as the girls in the parking lot.

235
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,470
但停車場很安靜
But he was quiet in the parking lot.

236
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,720
他如果躲在樹叢 有太多干樹枝了
If he hid in these trees, there's too much dry brush.

237
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,280
會很吵 不可能 這樣太草率
He would have made noise. No,it's too sloppy for him.

238
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,610
她是狂熱的慢跑愛好者
She was a serious jogger.

239
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,120
如果她聽到動靜 還是有機會逃脫的
If she'd heard him, she might have been able to outrun him.

240
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,280
除非他用別的辦法驚到她了 夥計們
Unless he surprised her some other way. Guys.

241
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,940
這是什麼? 絆索
What is that? A tripwire.

242
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,160
我們得看看她的腳踝
We need to look at her ankles.

243
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,470
他用絆索把她給絆倒了
He used the tripwire to get her off her feet.

244
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,620
她受到驚嚇 沒時間逃跑
She's stunned and she doesn't have time to run away.

245
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,500
他設了陷阱
He laid a trap for her.

246
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,050
再加上他切她脖子的方式
All this,plus the way he bleeds her at the neck.

247
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,330
這是獵手的行為
It's the behavior of a game hunter.

248
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,760
狩獵是這個城市文化的重要組成部分
Hunting's a big part of this city's culture.

249
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,170
那是獵捕動物 什麼導致他開始獵捕人類了?
Yeah,hunting animals is. What triggered him to start hunting humans?

250
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,760
這傢伙拿走人眼睛 顯然是心緒受到干擾
This guys king yeah,hupeople's eyes,is. So he's definitely disturbed.

251
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,680
我不解的是 這種人通常心慌意亂 行事草率
What bugs me is that people like this usually unravel, get sloppy.

252
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,730
但這傢伙卻越來越好
And this guy's only getting better.

253
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,960
他們回來了
They're back.

254
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,030
Morgan 我一直在這堭給q話 怎麼了?
Morgan,i'm fielding calls left and right here. What's happening?

255
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,720
案子變成全國性新聞了 他們稱他為眼球掠奪者
Case made national news. They're starting to call him the eye snatcher.

256
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,470
好吧 嗯 你去準備個小型記者招待會
All right,um, you're gonna hold a small, controlled press conference.

257
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
回答他們問題 但盡量別提那個名字
Answer their questions, but try to squash that name.

258
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,500
我希望人們有所警覺 但不希望大家把他想成一個怪物
I want the people to be aware, but I do not want to make a bogeyman out of this guy.

259
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,770
明白嗎? 好 是的
You understand? Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,250
還有事嗎? 你不接Strauss的電話
Is there something else? You're not answering strauss' calls.

261
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,570
她只是想監視我們 她可以等
She's just trying to keep tabs. She can wait.

262
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,150
Morgan 也許你現在該回下電話
Morgan. Maybe you should take the time to field the call.

263
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,450
Hotch 我們得建立知情者熱線
Hotch,we have to set up a tip line.

264
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,280
我們得重新看下JJ的談話要點 側寫還沒出來
We have to go over jj's talking points. We haven't gotten the profile out yet.

265
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,340
這些都比應付Strauss重要
All of that takes priority over dealing with strauss.

266
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,060
我明白 我們來幫你弄 你去和她談談
I understand all that. Let us help you set up strategy while you talk to her.

267
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,270
進一步行動之前跟你匯合
We'll regroup with you before we proceed.

268
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,370
要應付的已經夠多了 相信我 跟她再杠上沒好處
We have enough battles. Believe me,you don't want to fight her,too.

269
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,890
我們先側寫出來 我就去跟Strauss談
Let me get this profile out, and then i'll go talk to strauss.

270
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,560
他做得很好 是啊
He's doing a good job. He is.

271
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,050
你想過這要怎麼結束嗎?
Have you thought about how this is going to end?

272
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,210
你指什麼?
What do you mean?

273
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,020
Morgan當主管是暫時的
Morgan as our unit chief is a temporary thing.

274
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,280
是
It is.

275
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,540
他是天生的領導 他很擅長
He's a natural leader. He'll excel.

276
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,340
到時候需要他做回組員時 該怎麼辦?
What happens when he's asked to step down?

277
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,410
我們相信 不明疑犯認識第一個受害者 而其他則是隨機選擇
We believe that our unsub may have known his first victim, yet the rest were random.

278
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,070
大部分剜眼者精神失常 攻擊時瘋狂而草率
Most enucleators have a mental disorder and are frenzied and sloppy when they attack.

279
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,950
這個卻很能克制
This one has more control.

280
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,390
我們不用別名稱呼他
We are not calling him by any nickname.

281
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,920
他只是FBI要逮捕的一個兇手
He is simply a murderer that the fbi is trying to apprehend.

282
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,330
他耐心等待著置受害人於死地 知道如何下刀好放血
He lays in wait to kill his victims, knows how to cut them so they bleed out.

283
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,460
說明他也許有狩獵的背景
This indicates he might have a hunting background.

284
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,550
我們提醒市民夜晚高度警惕
We're urging citizens to be hypervigilant at night.

285
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,500
他在城堣ㄕP地區的公開場所殺人
He is killing in different areas of the city in public places.

286
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,280
他作案區域很廣 也許是和他的遷徙習慣有關
His large kill zone could be related to some type of travel pattern in his life,

287
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,430
說明這些小區很舒適
which indicates a comfort with these neighborhoods.

288
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,310
為什麼突然的他開始每天殺人?
Why,all of a sudden, is he killing people every day?

289
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,930
這種加速 也許是由一種自我加壓的時間線造成
The escalation might be caused by a selfimposed time line.

290
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,330
他不得不殺這麼多人 挖走眼睛 來完成一項任務
He has to murder so many people, take this many eyes, to accomplish a task.

291
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,180
所以他瘋了 但他卻有使命?
So he's crazy, but he's got a mission?

292
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,480
可以這麼說
Actually,yes.

293
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,070
他依著自己的幻覺 來進行這場殺戮
He's acting on a delusion that's fueling this murder spree.

294
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,930
比如Herbert Mullin
For example, a man named herbert mullin.

295
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,910
他害怕災難性地震襲擊加州
He had a fear of a catastrophic earthquake hitting california.

296
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,950
他相信通過殺人 並供奉他們的血給大地
Now,he believed that by killing people and offering their blood as a sacrifice to the earth,

297
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,910
就可以阻止地震
he could prevent an earthquake.

298
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,550
他是偏執型精神分裂者 他的幻覺使他殺了13個人
He was a paranoid schizophrenic, and his delusion led him to kill 13 people.

299
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,810
那我們巡街的時候該注意些什麼?
Uh,what should we look for when we're on the streets?

300
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,000
我們確信他是白人男性 27到35歲
We believe he's a white male,27 to 35.

301
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,450
我們確信他開貨車 或是有可卸倉的小型貨車
We believe he is driving a van or a pickup truck with a removable cab.

302
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,770
一些便宜的東西 可以弄得血淋淋又容易洗掉
Something utilitarian that can get bloody and wash out easily.

303
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,870
可能還曾申請狩獵執照
He may also have applied for hunting licenses.

304
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:35,730
他受過某種醫療外科訓練 但沒能走上職業道路
He has some sort of medical or surgical training but fell short of making a career out of it.

305
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,380
他曾經在過渡療養所 或是治療機構待過
He may have been in a halfway house or have been granted leave from a treatment facility.

306
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,820
也許家人將他接走 現在他回來了
Maybe his family moved him away and now he's back.

307
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,940
如果你知道符合以上描述的人 請撥打我們的熱線
If you know anyone who fits these types of scenarios, please call our tip line.

308
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:51,690
不明嫌犯在晚上殺人 使用狩獵策略 還十分耐心
Our unsub kills at night, employs hunting tactics, and is patient.

309
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,930
他一直等到能和受害人獨處
He will wait until he can be alone with his victims.

310
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,920
Strauss長官 你終於肯接我電話了?
Chief strauss. You're answering my calls now?

311
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,130
我為早上的事情道歉 但我肯定你能明白我們有多忙
Listen,i apologize for this morning, but I'm sure you can understand how busy we were.

312
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,840
所以今晚是什麼策略?
So what's the strategy tonight?

313
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,210
我和組員會去鎮上 幫助地方警力組織巡邏
I have the team visiting precincts all over town helping locals set up patrol.

314
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,760
媒體提醒居民高度警惕
And media outlets are warning citizens to be hypervigilant.

315
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,920
嫌疑犯呢?
What about suspects?

316
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,430
還沒什麼線索
Nothing viable yet.

317
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,330
也就是說你今晚抓不到他了
So ultimately, you're no closer to catching him tonight.

318
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,160
相信我 我非常明白 講話這會兒他正在尋找獵物呢
Ust me,i well aware that he is probably out there hunting as we speak.

319
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,230
如果明天醒來發現有更多受害人 我負全責
Now,if I wake up in the morning and there are more victims, that is all on me.

320
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,300
我不是在為難你
Look, I'm not criticizing you.

321
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,940
實際上 很多人信任你 想看你成功
In fact,there are a lot of people who have faith in you and want to see you succeed.

322
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,150
你明白嗎? 是的 女士
Do you understand that? Yes,ma'am.

323
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,530
我只是隨便問問 確認下你們的團隊是否仍然完好
I'm just checking in to make sure your team is intact

324
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,430
並且你工作需要的一切都不缺
and that you have everything you need to do your job.

325
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,970
這個小組很可靠 我們會完成任務的
This team is solid, and we will get the job done.

326
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,080
我們明天再聯繫
We'll touch base tomorrow.

327
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,000
我害怕去上班
I'm dreading going to work.

328
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,540
你總是這麼說
You always say that.

329
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,000
嘿 我會開始找份新工作
Hey,i'll start looking for a new job.

330
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,880
明天早上拿份兒報紙 把適合你的圈出來
We'll grab a paper in the morning and start circling whatever looks good to you.

331
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,640
你聽到什麼沒?
Did you hear something?

332
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,910
好奇怪
That's weird.

333
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,570
我看見有人
I see someone.

334
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,710
喂!
Hello!

335
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,240
喂?
Hello?

336
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,610
Wes? 他到底在幹嘛?
Wes? What the hell's he doing?

337
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,790
我好怕
I'm freaking out.

338
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,210
這堥S信號
There's no reception.

339
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,680
快走
Let's go.

340
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,250
不 Sandy 別走這邊
No,sandy. Not that way.

341
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,970
Wes 你看到沒? 安靜 寶貝 他會聽到的
Wes,can you see? Quiet,baby. He can hear us.

342
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,970
他在我們後面 到我前面來
He's behind us. Get in front of me.

343
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,560
我看不見
I can't see anything.

344
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,890
上車去 就在山下
Get to the car. Down the hill.

345
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,270
快快快
Go. Go,go.

346
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,200
快 Sandy 快跑
Go,sandy. Go.

347
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,820
Wes Wes?
Wes. Wes?

348
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,340
Wes
Wes.

349
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,870
不 不要
No,please don't.

350
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,560
還以為我比大家都來得早
thought i'd beat everyone here.

351
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,910
不
No.

352
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,090
你通宵在這?
You here all night?

353
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,590
不能再通宵了啊
You know you can't do that again,right?

354
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,700
Rossi 你走進來的時候 我真以為你要告訴我又有受害者
Rossi, when you walked in here, I really thought you were gonna tell me that there was another victim.

355
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,430
我們一點抓到這傢伙的運氣也沒有
We're having no luck at all trying to find this guy on paper.

356
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,490
所以我們得緩一緩 睡一下 神清氣爽地回來
That's why we step away, get some sleep, come back fresh.

357
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,400
我們在找一個醫生 又是獵人 又有精神疾病
We're looking for a doctor who is also a hunter and a former mental patient

358
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,240
喜歡挖人眼球
who happens to be cutting people's eyes out.

359
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,000
相信側寫 我們抓到他時 會知道側寫都是對的
Trust the profile. When we get him, it'll all make sense.

360
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,720
早上好 不 一點也不好
Good morning. No,it isn't.

361
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,050
不要告訴我
Don't tell me.

362
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,490
一男一女
A male and a female.

363
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,240
他又開始一次殺兩個?
He's back to killing 2?

364
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,620
但這次犯罪現場有些不同
There's something different about this crime scene, though.

365
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,320
他砍斷了電線 一點光亮也沒有
He cut the wires in the electrical boxes, killed all the lights.

366
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,680
他們就看不到了
So they couldn't see.

367
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,520
他想逼他們迷路 然後在黑暗中狩獵
He wanted to force them off the trail so he could hunt them in the dark.

368
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,070
如果他們看不到 他也看不到啊
If they couldn't see, he couldn't.

369
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,090
他很可能使用某種夜視輔助裝備 像獵人會使用的觀察鏡之類
He probably used some kind of night vision aid, like a scope,something a hunter would use.

370
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,200
她的頸動脈被割斷 眼球也不見了 和其他受害者一樣
Her carotid was severed, and her eyes are missing, just like the others.

371
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,680
他沒有挖男孩的眼睛
He didn't take the boy's eyes.

372
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,890
為什麼不拿? 有什麼特別的嗎?
Well,why not? What's so different?

373
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,950
他左眼有割裂痕跡 而右眼甚至動都沒動
There's a laceration on his left eye, the right eye he didn't even touch.

374
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,900
他手臂上有防禦傷 他很可能試圖反抗 保護女孩
He'sot defenounds on his arms. He probably tried to fight back to protect the girl.

375
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,840
在搏鬥的過程中 不明嫌犯 可能是傷到了他的眼睛
During the fight,the unsub could have cut his eye.

376
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,540
我們覺得他可能是在收集眼睛 要是他需要的是一對呢?
We said he might be collecting them. What if he needs a set?

377
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,030
那樣的損傷 毀了他的藏品
An injury like that ruins the collection.

378
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,150
它們是戰利品 我的天吶 什麼?
They're trophies. Oh,my god. What?

379
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,410
我知道這可能聽起來荒唐 但你聽我說完
I know this sounds crazy, but just hear me out.

380
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,260
動物標本剝制師?
A taxidermist?

381
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,980
Morgan還真可能說到點子了
Morgan might be onto something.

382
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,030
不明嫌犯收集成對的眼睛 而且必須完美無缺
The unsub's collecting sets of eyes that need to be flawless.

383
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,510
他是把他們作為戰利品保存的
Because he's preserving them as a trophy of some kind.

384
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,470
我們說過他是個獵手 獵人收集什麼做戰利品?
We said he was a hunter. What do hunters collect for trophies?

385
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,120
如果他並不是個醫生呢? 這樣就說得通了
What if we're wrong about him being a doctor? It makes sense.

386
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:03,470
動物標本剝制師擁有保存眼睛 和其他身體部位所需的所有技巧和工具
A taxidermist has all the skills and supplies needed to preserve eyes and other body parts.

387
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,550
他們知道如何像這樣精確摘除眼睛嗎?
Do they know how to surgically remove eyes like this?

388
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,580
是的 他們掌握解剖學知識
Yeah,they have anatomy knowledge.

389
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,270
他們要割下獸皮 就必須 一路切開肌肉 組織 神經
They have to cut through muscle,tissue,and nerves in order to remove hide.

390
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,610
這和摘除眼球是完全一樣的
It's the exact same thing for eyeballs.

391
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,920
Garcia 我開免提了
Garcia,you're on speaker.

392
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,280
同志們 我交叉比對了John O'Heron 和俄城動物標本剝制師名單
Comrades,i crossreferenced this john o'heron with okie city animal stuffers.

393
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:24,530
六周前 他開過一張250美元支票 作為Lloyd野外狩獵店的保證金
Turns out he wrote a $250 check as some sort of deposit for lloyd's wild game shop 6 weeks ago.

394
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,250
而這個地方離我們第一個受害者被 棄屍的那條田間路不到一英里
Now,this place is scant miles from the farm road where our first victim was dumped.

395
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,990
Lloyd有什麼記錄嗎?
Does lloyd have a record?

396
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,680
Lloyd Bulford有一條 近期官方記錄 而那是...
Lloyd bulford has one recent record from the city,and it is...

397
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,970
一張死亡證明 他四周前死了
A death certificate. He died 4 weeks ago.

398
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,090
死因是? 肺氣腫
Of what? Emphysema.

399
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,040
有曾有犯罪記錄的員工嗎?
Any employees with criminal records?

400
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,350
他根本沒有用人記錄
He's got no employment records at all.

401
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,540
他有一個28歲的兒子叫Earl 與他同住
He has a 28yearold son named earl who lives with him

402
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,510
有一項輕微犯罪記錄 三項虐待動物指控
who has a petty crime record and 3 counts of animal cruelty.

403
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,660
Garcia找出這兒子的所有資料 好滴
Garcia,get everything on the son. Okeydokey.

404
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Morgan我們可能找到疑犯了
Morgan,we may have someone.

405
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,040
俄克拉荷馬城市信託銀行來電
I'm calling from oklahoma city bank and trust.

406
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,550
這是我們第五次試圖 與Earl bulford先生聯繫
This is our fifth attempt to reach mr. Earl bulford.

407
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,260
我們只是想提醒您 您必須 收拾好您的私有物品
We just want to remind you that you need to collect all your belongings

408
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,310
在本週日前搬出該房產
and vacate the premises by sunday.

409
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,000
眼睛不對
The eyes aren't right.

410
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,980
你爸爸呢? 他得弄好這對眼睛
Where's your dad? He's gotta fix those eyes.

411
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,640
眼睛很好 你不會處理眼睛!
The eyes are good. You can't do eyes!

412
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,080
給我! 我拿到別家去
Here! I'm taking it somewhere else.

413
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,510
你不會處理眼睛
You can't do eyes.

414
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,750
有沒有精神疾病的記錄?
Is there any record of mental illness?

415
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,200
沒 但媽媽有眼睛慢性病變史 叫視網膜色素變性
No,but mom had a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa,

416
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,580
會最終導致她完全失明 而考慮到他犯下的這些罪行
which would eventually lead her to go blind, and considering his crimes,

417
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,240
那太詭異了 對吧?
that's super weird,right?

418
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,760
還有 她在他8歲那年死於一場車禍
So,anyway,she died in a car accident when he was 8,

419
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,400
其後他被學校開除 原因是和另一個孩子打架
and then he gets expelled from school for getting in a fight with a kid

420
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,300
並試圖把那孩子的眼睛挖出來
and trying to gouge the kid's eyes out.

421
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,490
我沒有找到他回學校上學的記錄 也沒有工作的記錄
I have no record of him returning to school, he has no employment records,

422
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,160
他從來沒有報過稅 名下也沒有信用卡
he's never filed for taxes, he doesn't have a credit card in his name.

423
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,630
除了駕照以外 沒有他任何記錄
Besides his driver's license, there's no record on him at all.

424
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,600
難怪他沒有 出現在我們任何一張清單上
That's probably why he didn't show up on any of our lists.

425
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,700
聽起來他像是完全依靠他爸爸
Sounds like he's totally dependent on his dad,

426
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,280
而爸爸死後 就沒人再關照他了
and when dad dies, there's no one left to check up on him.

427
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,010
爸爸開一輛1990年產 深棕色狩獵牌小貨車
Ok,dad drove a 1990 darkbrown chevy cargo van.

428
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,730
大新聞 債權人這周收房子了 並依法對其經營的事業使置留權
Hot news…creditors took the house this week, and a lien was put on the business.

429
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,390
失去了爸爸 他的房子 現在連家族事業也要丟了
Lost his dad,his house, about to lose the family business.

430
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,220
還用研究應激源嗎?
Care to choose a stressor?

431
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,170
我和Brantley負責後面
I'll take the back with brantley.

432
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,990
這堥S發現貨車 收到
There's no van here. Copy.

433
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,740
什麼也沒發現
I don't see anything.

434
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,680
Hotch我看見血了 我們進去了
Hotch,i see blood. We're going in.

435
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,580
沒有危險
Clear.

436
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,820
那肯定是John O'Heron的血
That's gotta be john o'heron's blood.

437
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,550
他來看他的動物標本 他們起了爭執 然後這一幕就發生了
So he comes here to see his animal, they argue, and then this happens.

438
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,730
沒有危險
Clear.

439
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,800
他睡在這
He's been sleeping here.

440
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:24,000
如果他現在不在這 那肯定又到外面獵捕去了
Well,if he's not here now, then he's out hunting again.

441
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,430
這個沒有眼睛

442
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,590
這個也沒有
Neither does this one.

443
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,810
這個有
This one does.

444
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,160
那些眼睛 就是派這個用處
This is what's he's doing with the eyes.

445
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,380
看這些
Look at these.

446
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,550
他從小就開始打獵了
He's been hunting since he was a kid.

447
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,420
沒上過學 他很可能 整個童年都待在這
Never went to school. Probably spent his entire childhood in here.

448
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,610
一個人在社交上如此孤立 難怪有精神問題
Somebody this socially isolated no doubt has mental issues.

449
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:21,030
看起來他只知道兩件事 打獵和剝皮做標本
Looks like he only knew two things… hunting and taxidermy.

450
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,690
只要爸爸還管著他 就沒事
Which was fine as long as daddy was supervising him.

451
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,910
如今把門兒的不在了 就不知何去何從
Now his gatekeeper's gone and he's loose.

452
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,200
請 就放在那邊好了 是 女士
Right over there, please. Yes,ma'am.

453
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,260
這比你們說的可要遲多了
This is much later than you guys said it was gonna be.

454
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,150
讓我看看
Let me see it.

455
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,600
我爸爸一定會非常喜歡的
My daddy's gonna love it.

456
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,390
怎麼了?
What?

457
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,930
我想要你點東西
I need something from you.

458
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,350
我想他全部的客戶資料都在這了
I think this is all of his customer information.

459
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,470
Morgan Prentiss 等等
Morgan,prentiss. Wait.

460
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,610
這個地址  交點路 離那兩名少女被殺地點很近
This address, junction road, it's close to where the teenage girls got killed.

461
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,220
我認為他的襲擊範圍遍佈全鎮 但都在客戶住處附近
I think he's attacking all over town close to where his customers live.

462
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,420
我認識這個客戶 枯河路 就在慢跑者被殺的公園附近
I know the customer on dry creek road, close to where that jogger got killed in the park.

463
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,230
上周那對情侶被殺的地方呢?
And what about where the couple was murdered last night?

464
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,430
臨近這個地址 在這
Close to this address here.

465
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,720
所以說 他是送這些動物標本 去客戶家
Ok,so he's delivering these animals to his clients' homes

466
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,590
然後在社區附近逗留尋找受害人
and then sticking around the neighborhood to find victims.

467
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,240
這媮晹釣潃茼a址
And there are 2 more addresses here.

468
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,490
好吧 我們分頭行動 我馬上派人手去這些地點
All right,we should split up and go. I'll get units to these locations.

469
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,040
好的 非常感謝
All right, thank you so much.

470
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,160
住Bleaker那邊的女士 今天都沒有見過他
The woman at the bleaker address hasn't seen him today.

471
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,930
其他住址 也都沒有反饋
No response at the other residence.

472
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,830
搞什麼鬼?
What the hell?

473
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,620
有什麼事嗎?
May I lp you?

474
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,930
我是FBI的Hotchner探員 這是Brantley隊長
I'm agent hotchner with the fbi. This is lieutenant brantley.

475
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,920
我們能進去嗎? 可以
May we come in? Yeah.

476
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,880
你今天收到這個男人 從動物標本製作鋪送來的貨了嗎?
Did you get a delivery today from a taxidermy shop from this man?

477
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,600
是 我收到了 對我所在區域發全境通告
Yes,i did. I need an apb in my area.

478
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,060
這是多久之前的事? 大概一個小時前
How long ago was this? About an hour ago.

479
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,620
他說他想要我點東西
He said he needed something from me.

480
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,940
我還有餘款未付 我給了錢他就走了
The balance I owed. I paid him and he left.

481
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,230
嚇得我魂飛魄散的 這對是玻璃的
He creeped the hell out of me. These are glass.

482
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,320
是什麼事情?
What is this about?

483
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,500
Hotchner探員 他們找到貨車了 離這很近
Agent hotchner. They found the van. It's close.

484
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,290
失陪
Excuse us.

485
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,350
他一定就在附近 你沿這條街向北
He must be close by. You take the street to the north.

486
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,360
救命!
Help!

487
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,960
Motor路和Descanso路附近 我需要支援
I need backup near motor and descanso.

488
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,720
FBI! Earl! 放開她!
Fbi,earl! Get off of her!

489
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,850
我們抓到他了 抓到他了! 叫救護車!
We got him. We got him! Call an ambulance!

490
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,020
我們需要醫療支援 8800街區 Descanso路南側
We need medical assistance. 8800 block of descanso, south side of the street.

491
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,350
看好他
Secure him.

492
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,370
你能聽見我說話嗎? 醫生馬上就到 別動
Can you hear me? Help is on the way. Hold still.

493
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,470
別動
Hold still.

494
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,020
等我們回去你可以和FBI的人談
You can talk to the fbi when we come back.

495
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,420
這堳蝏穧^事? 他一個人把他制服了
What happened here? Took him down by himself.

496
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,580
Hotch
Hotch.

Brantley說你單槍匹馬制服他的

他就在我後面不遠
He wasn't far behind me.

499
