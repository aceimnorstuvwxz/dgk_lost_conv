00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,560
* when the routine bites hard *

3
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,870
* and ambitions are low *

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,100
* and resentment rides high *

5
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,380
* but emotions won't grow *

6
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,610
* and we're changing our ways *

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,410
* taking different roads *

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,180
* love will tear us apart again *

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,510
最棒一次演出了 Dante! 偉大的演出!
Best show ever, dante! Great show!

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,890
幹得好! 漂亮極了! 讓我....
Nice job! Beautiful.Just let me…

11
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,310
聽著 你不能去媄 知道嗎? 待在那
Hey,uh,look,you're not allowed to be over there, all right? Stay there.

12
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,890
他來了
Here he comes.

13
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,650
我知道 我知道 我知道
I know. I know. I know.

14
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,900
他盯著我看呢 你看到了嗎?
He looked right at me. Did you see that?

15
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,790
我看到了 我看見他盯著你看
I saw it. I saw him look right at you.

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,130
我倆之間有火花誒
We had a connection.

17
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,190
他唱<轉世重生>的時候 好像劇院堜狾酗H都消失了
When he sang "resurrection" it was like everyone in the theater just disappeared.

18
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,450
他唱得如此漂亮 太棒了 真絕了 夥計
He is so beautiful. So beautiful. Totally,man.

19
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,160
太漂亮了 我們走了
So beautiful. This is us.

20
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,280
兩個都走? 是的
Both of you? Yeah.

21
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,810
我們住在同一街區 白癡
We live on the same block,dummy.

22
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,730
可以...陪你們走回去 什麼?
I could,uh,walk you to your building. What?

23
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,910
天...天黑了嘛 然後呢?
I mean,it's…it's dark. So?

24
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,100
我們得走了 我只是說天黑了 我可以陪你們走...
We gotta go. I'm just saying,it's dark.I could walk you…

25
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,930
我肯定比你更強壯 Ted
I'm pretty sure I'm tougher than you are,ted.

26
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,400
多謝你帶我們來看演唱會 Ted 再見!
Thank you for taking us to the concert,though,ted. Yeah. Bye!

27
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,380
再見 我叫Ed 不是Ted
Byebye. It's ed,not ted.

28
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,870
最近一名受害者叫Tara Farris 20歲
The latest victim is tara farris,20.

29
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,620
她是兩周內的第3名受害者
She's the third victim in 2 weeks.

30
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,180
都是上下班的人在公路出口發現的
All found on freeway offramps by commuters.

31
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,510
他沒有把屍體藏起來
Well,he's not hiding them.

32
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,970
扔在洛杉磯早高峰的公路上 他想讓人們發現屍體
An l.a.freeway during morning rush hour? He wants them found.

33
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,300
越快發現越好
Quickly.

34
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,570
她們還穿著衣服 基本不會嚇到路人
Well,they're still dressed. That minimizes the shock value.

35
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,230
也許他關心她們 希望她們能得到照顧?
Maybe he's concerned for them. Think he wants them taken care of?

36
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,020
受害者都沒遭受性侵犯
No signs of sexual assault on any of the victims.

37
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,570
看她臉色多蒼白
Look how pale she is.

38
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,750
她們都有嚴重脫血
All of them were severely hypovolemic.

39
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,160
Tara體內剩下不到1品脫的血
Tara had less than a pint of blood in her.

40
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,460
看這個 前兩個受害者 都剩下3品脫多的血
Look at this. The first 2 had more than 3 pints each.

41
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,150
如果他的目標是放血 不明嫌犯顯然已經駕輕就熟
If exsanguination is the goal, the unsub is definitely becoming more proficient.

42
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,260
這一點是新的 Tara是唯一留下信息的受害者
This is new. Tara's the only victim to have a written message.

43
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,270
"你這騙子"
"the liar."

44
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,750
"你這"騙子 很怪對吧?
"the" liar. That's strange,isn't it?

45
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,930
不是"一個騙子"或僅僅"騙子"
Not a liar or just liar.

46
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,070
你到底撒什麼謊了 Tara?
So what did you lie about,tara?

47
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,580
所有受害者都被勒死 然後放血
All of the victims appear to have been strangled and then bled out

48
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,530
喉嚨上有一樣的傷口
through identical wounds in the throat.

49
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,470
等等 說真的 這印子是尖牙咬的嗎?
Wait…seriously, are those supposed to be fang marks?

50
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,250
受害者身上所有傷口都留有唾液
All of the wounds on the victims were covered in saliva.

51
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,710
人類唾液 好像是... 有人喝了她們的血
Human saliva, as though… Someone drank their blood.

<font color=#FF7F00>犯罪心理 第五季 第7集</font>
<font color=#DB70DB>Criminal Minds Season05 Episode07 The Performer</font>

53
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,620
在所有描述邪惡鬼怪的黑暗文字
In all the darkest pages of the malign supernatural,

54
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,370
沒有比描述吸血鬼傳統更可怕的了
There is no more terrible tradition than that of the vampire.

55
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,900
他是魔界的賤民
A pariah even among demons.

56
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,080
作家 Montague Summers
Writer montague summers.

57
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,640
好的 謝謝 他們已經在洛杉磯 安排了特遣部隊
Ok,thanks. So they've already set up a task force in los angeles.

58
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,640
這不是他們第一宗連環殺人案
This isn't their first serial case.

59
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,250
還記得Owen Kim探員嗎? 上次查跟蹤案的
You remember detective owen kim? From the stalker case.

60
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,980
你還記得那宗案子 對吧 Spence?
You remember that case, don't you,spence?

61
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,140
我是記得那案子
I do remember that case.

62
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,100
還有沒有... 跟那個Lila聯繫了?
Yeah,you ever talk to,um, lila anymore?

63
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,750
我想我們現在應該 把注意力集中在這個案子上
You know,i think we should probably focus on this case right now.

64
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,480
這樣做比較合適
It's a little more pertinent.

65
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,450
好 說說吸血的傢伙吧 Reid
All right,so tell us about blooddrinkers,reid.

66
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,310
嗜人血者 或者叫臨床吸人膏血者 被稱作Renfield綜合癥
Human blood consumption, or clinical vampirism, is known as renfield's syndrome,

67
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,630
是根據布拉姆·斯托克的小說<德古拉>中 一個吃昆蟲的角色而命名的
Named after the insecteating character in bram stoker's novel "dracula."

68
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,370
他們是虐待狂嗎? 不一定
Are they sadists? Not necessarily.

69
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,140
給受害者帶來的傷害通常是順帶的 他們關注的是人血
Pain to the victim is usually only a byproduct. Blood is the focus.

70
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,540
Renfield綜合癥通常伴有 不同程度的精神分裂癥
Renfield's syndrome is usually accompanied by varying levels of schizophrenia

71
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,970
如果發展得更厲害 更會有典型的同類相食
And occasionally more classic cannibalism if the condition evolves.

72
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,070
典型的同類相食 咱這工作真是開眼界呀
Classic cannibalism. Lovely job we have.

73
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,340
這麼說吧…真實的案件極少
I will say this… true cases are exceedingly rare.

74
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,580
總算讓人舒了口氣 算是吧
That's comforting. Sort of.

75
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,350
Renfield癥患者可能罕見 吸血鬼卻到處都是
Renfield's may be rare, but vampires are anything but.

76
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,020
洛杉磯有非常龐大的 "吸血不死"亞文化群
And there's a huge subculture in los angeles of the reddrinking undead.

77
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,260
我怎麼見怪不怪呢
Why is that not a surprise?

78
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,700
Garcia 這些人都吸血嗎?
Garcia,all these people drink blood?

79
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,200
正相反 大部分只是像Prentiss高中時那樣 搞一身裝扮 然後裝神弄鬼
Au contraire. They mostly just dress up like prentiss did in high school and they make believe.

80
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,460
品味各不相同呀 這兩個根本是天壤之別
It's all kinds of delicious. It's not the same thing at all.

81
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,630
事實上 我們該說不明嫌犯是個 吸血鬼主義者 而不是吸血鬼
As a matter of fact, we should refer to this unsub as a vampirist,not a vampire.

82
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,650
他們被亞文化吸引 僅僅是因為它對人血的崇拜
And they would be attracted to the subculture merely for its professed worship of blood.

83
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,490
好吧 我繼續在各種網站挖掘
Ok,i'm going to continue spelunking through the various online sites,

84
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,000
看有沒啥東西跳出來 咬我一口
See if anything jumps up and bites me.

85
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,820
謝謝 寶貝... 謝謝 Penelope 跟緊點
Thanks,baby g… Thanks,penelope. Stay close.

86
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,600
遵命 長官  Garcia斷線
Yes,sir. Garcia out.

87
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,150
各位 還有一點 吸血鬼主義者貪得無厭
You guys,one more thing… vampirists are coveters.

88
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,180
一般都是和受害者有某種聯繫
They most generally always have some sort of relationship with the victim,

89
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,100
就算只是一面之緣 也會讓他們如癡如醉
Even if it's tangential. And they're likely to become obsessed.

90
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,290
他們肯定在某方面有交集
They've almost certainly crossed paths in some way.

91
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,370
<i>加利福尼亞州 洛杉磯</i>

92
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,060
沒事的 只有我 是Ray 你咋還在睡呢?
It's ok. It's just me. It's ray. You still in bed?

93
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,400
我病了
I'm sick.

94
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,940
聽著 Dante 你已經遲到了
Look,dante, you're already late.

95
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,280
別這麼叫我 對不起 夥計 你得出發了 好嗎?
Don't call me that. Sorry,but,man, you gotta get going,ok?

96
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,760
我說不去
I said no.

97
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,420
唱片公司又要發火了 如果你不…
The record company is gonna be pissed again.If you're not…

98
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,210
出去!
get out!

99
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,830
我知道你討厭這些聚會 但是你要把唱片賣出去呀
I know you hate these parties, but you've got to sell the record.

100
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,890
你不能撒手不管 這是你的工作 夥計
You can't blow this off. It's your job,man.

101
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,270
我的工作則是催你
And it's my job to make you go.

102
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,880
必須變成他嗎?
Do I have to be him?

103
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,790
你知道你必須的
You know that you do.

104
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,080
我20分鐘後準備好 很好 我給你準備點吃的
I'll be down in 20 minutes. Great. I'll make you something to eat.

105
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,010
我不餓
I'm not hungry.

106
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,480
昨晚怎麼了? 什麼意思?
What happened to you last night? What do you mean?

107
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,240
演出結束後 你好像人間蒸發了
After the show. You just kind of disappeared.

108
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,820
我不記得了
I don't remember.

109
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,070
嗨 Kim副隊長 我是Jareau探員
Hi,lieutenant kim. Agent jareau.

110
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,510
JJ嘛 我知道 我記得你們大部分人
Jj,of course. I remember most of you.

111
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,990
Hotchner探員 Reid Morgan
Agent hotchner. Reid. Morgan.

112
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,820
歡迎回到西海岸
Welcome back to the left coast.

113
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,860
這兩位是Prentiss和Rossi探員 相信你沒見過他們
These are agents prentiss and rossi. I believe they're new to you.

114
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,350
很高興認識你
Pleasure.

115
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,040
我們已經整理出一房間 擺好玻璃板 案卷 以及超難喝的咖啡
We already have a room set up full of glass boards, case files, and extremely bad coffee.

116
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,270
更艱難的我們都合作過
We've worked with a lot less.

117
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,610
現在Morgan探員是老大 他說了算
Agent morgan's in charge now. It's his show.

118
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,990
說來話長
Long story.

119
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,060
我知道你們喜歡從最新線索入手 然後往回分析
I know you like to start with the freshest information and work your way back.

120
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,650
Tara的公寓已經處理過並封鎖起來 留著讓你們去
So tara's apartment has been processed and sealed in case you want to go there.

121
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
她的屍體 和前2個遇害的女生一起
And her body,along with that of the first 2 girls,

122
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,250
都在停屍房 驗屍員隨時等候
Is at the morgue with an m.e.waiting there for your call.

123
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,130
好吧 JJ 把這埵洵B妥當 和Garcia聯繫上
All right. Jj,get set up here, and then hook up with garcia.

124
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,230
把目擊證人的信息傳給她 讓她同前2個遇害者的資料交叉比對
Send her the witness information so she can start crossreferencing with the first 2 victims.

125
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,170
Reid 我要你閱讀所有的案卷資料
Reid,i want you to go through all the case files,

126
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,090
根據你對精神病理學的研究 寫一份初步側寫
Set up a preliminary profile based on what you already know about the psychopathology.

127
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,200
其他人 我們去看看 從Tara身上能找到什麼
And the rest of us,let's find out what we can on tara.

128
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,490
我們要找目擊證人之間的聯繫
So we're looking for a connection between the witnesses.

129
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,660
吸血鬼主義者心有迷戀 他們不大會去找隨機的受害者
When vampirists become obsessed, they aren't likely to find a random victim.

130
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,300
如果能找到所有受害者之間的交叉點 將能幫上大忙
If we can find a crossrelationship, someone in all the victims' lives, that'll be incredibly helpful.

131
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,040
Gina King認識Tara最久 她們一起上過學
Gina king knew tara the longest. They apparently had some classes together.

132
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,800
我們把她倆的關係全挖出來
Let's get all the information we can on that relationship.

133
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,750
話說 把Tara所有朋友的信息都給我
As a matter of fact, get me everything you can on all of tara's friends.

134
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,740
好吧 明早我會查到他們並跟蹤下去
All right. In the morning i'll track them down and do some followup.

135
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,900
好的
That's fine.

136
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,180
Dante 這位是<金屬人生>的Jeff
Dante. This is jeff from "metal life" magazine.

137
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,500
他在寫一篇關於藝術家跨界風格...
He's writing a story on artists who cross over…

138
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,370
"跨界" 我還有"跨界風格"呀 <金屬人生>的Jeff?
Cross over. Is that what I do,jeff from "metal life"?

139
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,270
算是呀 你的音樂也不是 純粹的哥特 對吧?
I guess,kind of. You're not totally goth,right?

140
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,190
吸血鬼的這檔子事兒...
That whole vampire thing you do is…

141
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,650
啊 吸血鬼的這檔子事兒?
Ah,the vampire thing?

142
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,050
對 你的表演 對特定的人群很有吸引力
Yeah,your act. It appeals to certain people.

143
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,540
絕望又痛苦的人們 盡力又無力掌控現實 我的音樂對他們最有吸引力
It appeals to desperate, sad people with,at best,a tenuous hold on reality.

144
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,290
我能引用你這句話嗎?
Can I quote you on that?

145
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,130
可以 請自便吧
Sure. Knock yourself out.

146
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,710
別 可別引用那句話 我能把他拉回來 再...
No,don't use that quote. 'Cause I can just get him back, get another…

147
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,150
別操心了 夥計
You know what, don't even bother,man.

148
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,740
他早就過了氣兒了 威士忌在哪?
He was old news 5 years ago. Where's the scotch?

149
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,840
聽著 是這樣的 他最近不在狀態
Listen,here's the thing, he's not on his game lately.

150
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,210
簡直和我在喬治敦大學時 租的第一所公寓一模一樣
This is almost exactly like my first apartment in georgetown.

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,940
我媽希望我住在學校 但我鐵了心要自力更生 所以...
My mom wanted me to stay on campus, but I was determined to make it,so...

152
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,540
我週末去當服務員 供著公寓
I waitressed on the weekends to swing it.

153
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,010
那得是多出色的服務員吶 能養得起喬治敦的公寓
You must have been a hell of a waitress to swing an apartment in georgetown.

154
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,180
我差勁死了 能供得起房子 是因為我媽每周都給我打錢
No,i sucked.I only got by 'cause my mom put money in my account every week

155
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,500
然後彼此心照不宣
and we both pretended I didn't know.

156
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,920
看樣子她在學習拍電影
Looks like she was studying to make movies.

157
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,560
Rossi
Rossi.

158
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,050
這傢伙是誰?
Who is this guy?

159
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,490
如今 想瞭解一個年輕女孩的生活
Well,if you want to look into a young girl's life today,

160
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,400
你得進入她的myspace facebook和twitter賬戶
You have to access her myspace, facebook,and twitter accounts.

161
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,570
我給地球上最性感的黑客打電話
I'll call the sexiest hacker on the planet.

162
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,260
他肯定不會把那句話寫進文章堛
I don't think he's going to print that quote.

163
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,860
管他呢?
Who cares?

164
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,330
不該那麼說你的歌迷呀
You shouldn't say stuff like that about your fans.

165
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,360
也許我就該一跳了之 我可是吸血鬼呀
Maybe i'll just jump off. I mean,i'm a vampire.

166
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,150
也許我能隨風飛走
Maybe I could just fly away.

167
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
我不喜歡談論這個
I don't like that kind of talk.

168
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,780
怎麼了 Ray 害怕會失去你的搖錢樹?
What's wrong,ray, afraid you're gonna lose your cash cow?

169
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,480
你怎麼了?
What's happened to you?

170
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,800
這沒關係 別這樣 我們曾經很開心的 還記得嗎?
It doesn't matter. Come on. We used to have fun,remember?

171
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,850
我不再寫歌了
I don't make music anymore.

172
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,470
而是製造場面 我只是在演戲
I make events. I play a character.

173
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,500
你賣唱片呀
You sell records.

174
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,380
我的歌又爬不上銷量榜了
It's not as if I exactly light up the sales charts anymore,anyway.

175
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,000
一定還能大賣的
You'll sell again.

176
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,820
Ray 你可能是我僅有的朋友了 但是...
Ray,you may be the only friend I have left, but...

177
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,740
你騙起人來可真蹩腳
You're a pretty crappy liar.

178
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,200
真對不起! 是我的錯 是我不對
I'm so sorry! It's my fault. It's my fault.

179
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,730
讓我幫你吧
Let me help you.

180
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,080
你的手真吸引人
Interesting hand.

181
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,520
你知道我是誰嗎? 知道
Do you know who I am? Yeah.

182
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,930
你是那個唱歌的人 這是你的派對 不是嗎?
I mean, you're the music guy. This is your party,right?

183
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,690
是的 這是…這是我的派對 但是...
Yes. This is… This is for me,but...

184
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,360
我有個兜子 堶掘侉﹞F 能讓咱倆非常高興的東西
I have a pocket full of what will make us both feel so much happier.

185
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,250
是嗎? 咱們一塊兒離開這兒吧
You do? So let's get out of here.

186
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,070
真的嗎? 真的 來吧 咱們走
Really? Yeah. Come on,let's go.

187
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,350
你不會後悔的
You won't be sorry.

188
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,240
唾液還沒有經DNA確認 但是我們會 把它送到實驗室檢測的
The saliva hasn't been dna i.d.'d, but we have it going through the lab.

189
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,410
你們可以把樣本送到當局實驗室 然後催他們快點兒處理
You can have the samples sent over to the local bureau lab and have them rush it.

190
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,410
到明天你至少得有點兒結果
You should have something by sometime tomorrow.

191
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,340
我現在就送過去
I'll have it sent right over.

192
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,230
這些不是咬痕 看這些邊緣 是剃刀一樣鋒利的東西留下的
They're not bites. Look at the edges. They're razor sharp.

193
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,300
如果是牙齒咬的會留下一個 粗糙的撕裂邊緣
A tooth would leave a ragged,torn edge.

194
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,960
桌上有幾張動物咬痕的照片 可以對比一下
I have some photos of animal bites on the table for comparison.

195
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,930
是某種鑽孔工具嗎?
Some sort of boring instrument,then?

196
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,720
非常鋒利而且非常有效
Very sharp and very efficient.

197
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,900
如果不是咬痕 那麼唾液 是死後舔的時候留下的?
Well,if it isn't a bite, then the saliva, is it from licking,afterwards?

198
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,630
也許吧 我從來沒見過像這樣的東西
Maybe. I haven't seen anything like it.

199
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,640
這樣的不明嫌犯一旦開始... 情況就只能越來越糟
Once an unsub like this gets started... It only gets worse.

200
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,890
我是Chase Manning 12號新聞直升機 位於San Fernando 谷101號公路上方
This is chase manning, news chopper 12, over the 101 freeway in the san fernando valley.

201
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,190
在一個出口匝道上又發現了屍體 與前幾天那一樁情形相同
Apparently a second body in as many days has been found near an offramp.

202
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,140
媒體是無孔不入啊
So much for keeping the media out.

203
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,890
Penelope? 能開始了嗎?
Penelope? Are we in yet?

204
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,750
都靠你了
All yours.

205
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,750
我總是很討厭這樣調查 一個人的一生
I always feel skeevy going through someone's life like this.

206
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,610
看起來所有的密碼都被保護了 所以可能無法...
Ok,so everything looks like it's password protected, so you might not even be able to…

207
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,620
你都破解了是不是? 密碼是Cullen
You're in already, aren't you? The password was cullen.

208
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,680
可不是 Colon(直腸)?
Of course. Colon?

209
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,880
是Cullen <暮光之城>堛漣l血鬼家族
Cullen. The vampire family from "twilight."

210
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,790
<暮光之城>是啥?
What's "twilight"?

211
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,540
你除了讀技術書籍之外 還讀別的書嗎?
Do you ever read anything other than technical books?

212
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,530
英文的不是很多
Not much in english.

213
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,970
我看看能發現點兒什麼 我的承受力可是很強的
Ok,i'll see what I can dredge. My love is strong.

214
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,900
好的 謝謝
Ok,thanks.

215
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,640
側寫準備的怎麼樣了? 不知道 其實我從沒覺得真正準備好過
How's the profile coming? I don't know. I never really feel ready,you know?

216
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,970
沒事的 我得先跟Tara的bff談談
It'll be fine.I am gonna go talk to tara's bff

217
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,980
免得媒體窮追猛打 事態就無法控制了
before the media requests come in and it gets too crazy.

218
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,710
bff是什麼? 永遠的死黨
What's a bff? Best friend forever.

219
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,940
我要跟你一塊兒去嗎? 不 你要準備側寫
Should I go with you? No. You have a profile to deliver.

220
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,340
真該好好準備側寫了
I should really work on it a little more.

221
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,660
Reid 你拿我手機幹什麼?
Reid. What are you doing with my phone?

222
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,870
Derek  Spence已經準備好側寫了
Derek,hey,um, spence is ready for the profile.

223
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,730
為什麼 是的  他就在我旁邊
Why,yes,he is, right here.

224
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,960
我很快回來
I'll be back.

225
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,800
好的Reid 我們馬上回來
All right,reid. We'll be right in.

226
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,950
Hotch Reid準備好側寫了 好的
Hotch,reid's ready with the profile. Good.

227
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,120
公路巡邏隊天剛亮的時候 發現了屍體
Highway crew found her just as the sun was coming up.

228
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,410
屍體在這埵h久了?
How long's she been here?

229
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,420
體溫還沒有完全冷卻 也許一小時
Barely even cold yet. Hour,maybe.

230
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,020
"你這騙子" 相同的信息
The liar. The same message.

231
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,250
顯然不是單獨針對Tara
Apparently it wasn't taraspecific.

232
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,370
那我就好奇這是什麼意思了
I wonder what it means, then.

233
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,660
第一次連續兩天殺人
The first victim on a consecutive day.

234
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,570
Kim警探 讓現場技術人員隨時 通知我們調查過程嗎?
Detective kim, can you have your crime scene techs keep us apprised of the processing?

235
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,540
我們準備好進行初步的側寫了
We're ready with a preliminary profile.

236
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,230
真快 不明嫌犯也越來越快
That's quick. So's this unsub.

237
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,470
我們要找的 不是超自然意義上的吸血鬼
We aren't looking for a vampire in the supernatural sense,

238
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,480
只是這個不明嫌犯對人血 有著強烈的渴求
Only in the sense that this unsub has a very strong desire, a need,for human blood.

239
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,160
幸運的是 吸血鬼主義者具有顯著特徵 能幫助我們找到他
Now,fortunately, vampirists display several characteristics which will be helpful in finding him.

240
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,210
他會反覆割傷自己
He will have cut himself repeatedly.

241
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,870
這叫做"自動吸血主義" 本質上要成為自己的第一個犧牲者
It's called autovampirism, essentially becoming his own first victim.

242
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,700
他就是通過這種方式第一次吸人血
It's the way by which he first tasted human blood.

243
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,180
大部分的吸血鬼主義者對此感到極度羞愧 因此會穿長袖襯衫
Most vampirists are incredibly ashamed of this and will wear longsleeved shirts

244
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,430
以此來掩蓋這一行為
in order to conceal it.

245
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,460
其次 這種人曾有較長的虐待動物史
Secondly,there will be a long history of animal abuse,

246
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,110
首先是虐待較小的動物 比如昆蟲和齧齒動物
Starting with smaller animals such as insects and rodents

247
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,360
然後演變成虐待大一些的動物 比如說狗和貓
and then working his way up to larger things… Dogs and cats.

248
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,820
儘管這是在其他連環殺手身上發現的 廣泛認可的三個殺人特質之一
Though this is a wellrecognized component of the homicidal triad seen in other serial killers,

249
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,410
在吸血鬼主義者身上 這個特質更為明顯
In the case of the vampirist, it's more pronounced.

250
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,580
很有意思的是 他不會像其他 有變態心理的人那樣
There will, interestingly enough, not be any animal torture,

251
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,380
對動物進行任何折磨
As with other psychopathologies.

252
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,570
殺戮並不是關鍵 它僅僅是獲得血液的一種手段
The killing isn't the point, it's merely a means by which to obtain the blood.

253
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,110
仔細查找你們手中動物管理的相關記錄 盡可能查得久遠一些
Look hard at your animal control sections records, as far back as you can.

254
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,820
這些記錄 很可能有不明嫌犯 青少年時的犯罪記錄
They will probably have some record of this unsub as an adolescent.

255
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,650
如今 這個人很有可能 住在破舊的老房子
This guy also most likely lives in a poorly kept older home.

256
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,740
他需要一幢房子 而不是一間公寓 可以不受干擾
He needs a house for the privacy, not an apartment.

257
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,050
吸乾一個人的血是需要時間的
It takes some time to drain a body completely of blood.

258
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,650
沒人打擾的時間
Uninterrupted time.

259
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,100
不明嫌犯很可能與年長女性同住 祖母 媽媽 甚至是嬸嬸
This unsub also most likely lives with an elderly woman, a grandmother,a mother, even an aunt.

260
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,200
你是怎麼知道的?
How could you know that?

261
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,710
這種精神疾病 通常伴有極度的精神分裂
This type of mental illness, accompanied by extreme schizophrenia,

262
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,420
主宰著一個家庭的存在
Dominates a family's entire existence.

263
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,020
通常家庭因此而破裂 女人成為支撐家庭的主要角色
It often leads to a broken home, and a woman ends up as primary caregiver.

264
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,610
男人通常會離開
The men generally leave.

265
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,700
還有一點 這種精神異常藏不了很久
Oh,and one more thing. This type of disorder cannot be hidden for long.

266
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,050
我可以肯定 有人已經知道 這個不明嫌犯病得異常嚴重
I guarantee you someone out there already knows this unsub is very,very sick.

267
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,780
你沒事吧? 還好吧? 要... 要我叫醫生來嗎?
You ok? You all right? Should i…should I call somebody?

268
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,890
告訴我發生什麼了 跟我說 告訴我
Tell me what's happening. Talk to me. Talk to me.

269
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,400
天啊 我停不下來了
Oh,my god. I can't stop it.

270
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,600
我想要停下來 好的
I want to. Yeah.

271
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,280
但是我停不下來
But I can't stop it.

272
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,660
你得幫我 我知道 我會的
You gotta help me. I know. I will.

273
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,770
你得幫我 我會的 你沒事吧?
You gotta help me. I will. Are you all right?

274
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,230
我不能阻止它 告訴我
I can't stop it. Talk to me.

275
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,890
過來
Come here.

276
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,590
我們會解決這個問題的 好嗎? 我會解決的
We're gonna fix this,ok? I'm gonna fix this.

277
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,510
Morgan探員 我們已經確認了 今早發現的受害人
Agent morgan, we've identified this morning's victim.

278
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,820
Erin Hickman 她昨晚在一個活動的酒會工作
Erin hickman. She worked for a caterer at an event last night.

279
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,450
他們還在那兒清理
They're still there cleaning up.

280
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,370
我在哪堹鄑鋮閵asters女士?
Where can I find ms. Masters?

281
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,400
她就在那兒 謝謝你
She's right there. Thank you.

282
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,980
打攪一下 Masters女士? 我是洛城警局的Kim副隊長
Excuse me. Ms.masters? I'm lieutenant kim,lapd.

283
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,960
是有關Erin的事嗎? 是的女士
Is this about erin? Yes,ma'am.

284
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,960
她真的死了嗎? 是的女士 我很抱歉
Is she really dead? Yes,ma'am. I'm sorry.

285
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,880
這兩位是FBI探員 Morgan和Prentiss FBI?
These are FBI agents morgan and prentiss. Fbi?

286
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,970
Erin Hickman 是你的員工嗎? 昨晚之前都是
Erin hickman work for you? Well,till last night.

287
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,690
派對的中途她就翹班了 翹班?
She walked out on me in the middle of the party. Walked out?

288
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,570
就我所知 她前腳還在後腳就沒影了
All I know is she was here one minute and gone the next.

289
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,750
她經常這麼不負責任嗎?
Was it uncommon for her to be irresponsible?

290
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,650
她都死了 我也不想說壞話 她在毒品方面有點兒問題
Look,i don't want to speak ill of the… she had a problem with drugs.

291
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,410
我看一下
Excuse me.

292
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,740
Morgan 我們在Tara的家 發現了他的海報
Morgan. We saw a poster of him in tara's house.

293
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,320
視頻 請講
Speak to me,vision.

294
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,560
Garcia 給我所有歌手Dante的資料
Garcia,give me everything you've got on a singer named dante.

295
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,800
Dante 那個吸血的傢伙? 我正要給你們電話
Dante,the vampire guy? I was just about to call you.

296
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,770
你認識他?
You know him?

297
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,480
他是所有受害者的唯一共通點
Uh,he's the one thing that all of our victims have in common.

298
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,590
這是什麼意思?
What do you mean?

299
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,680
她們在網絡上給這個傢伙 建了一個神社
They have cyber shrines set up for this guy.

300
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,960
她們崇拜他 她們都被他的音樂迷住了
They worship him. They're obsessed with his music.

301
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,400
他的新專輯今天出爐 名字就叫"你這騙子"
Well,his new album comes out today and it's called "the liar."

302
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,890
"你這騙子" 我知道 這不就是寫在她們身上的詞嗎?
"the liar," I know. And isn't that what was written on them?

303
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,640
所有的受害人 包括之前的兩個 都是他的鐵桿粉絲
Ok,uh,all of our victims, including the first two, were diehard fans.

304
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,860
Tara和Gina … 她是Tara的朋友 幾乎可以說是管理著歌迷俱樂部
Tara and gina… that's tara's friend… they were practically running his fan club.

305
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,380
最後一個受害人Erin Hickman 又是怎麼回事?
What about erin hickman, our latest victim?

306
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,400
Erin Hickman 我還沒有交叉比對這個名字
Erin hickman…i haven't run across that name.

307
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,080
我們得會會這個叫Dante的傢伙
Ok,we need to talk to this dante guy.

308
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,870
Garcia 能查到地址嗎?
Garcia,can you get us an address?

309
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,590
恐怕得查一會兒吧
That's gonna take a little while.

310
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,810
這些明星都躲在層層隱私之下
These celebrities are protected by layers of privacy.

311
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,980
要挖這個信息 可是深得...
It's like finding information on a deeply…

312
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,270
地址是Holmby山 Greenvale環路 22423號
22423 greenvale circle, holmby hills.

313
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,440
正把GPS坐標傳給你們
Gps coordinates are uploading to you now.

314
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,150
對了 他真名叫Paul Davies
And his name is paul davies,by the way.

315
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,210
也查查他的犯罪記錄
Run him for a criminal record,too.

316
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,600
沒問題 謝謝你P.G
You got it. Thanks,p.g.

317
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,880
不敢想像她能在我身上查出什麼
I'd hate to think what she could find out about me.

318
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,750
我寧可想都不想
Oh,i prefer not even to consider it.

319
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,850
這不像有很多破敗的單親家庭住房
It doesn't look like a lot of poorly maintained singlefamily homes.

320
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,120
是不像
No.

321
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,480
我討厭這樣問 但你們的側寫 會不會有時偏差很大?
I hate to ask this, but are your profiles this far off sometimes?

322
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,810
從來沒有過
They haven't been yet.

323
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,560
也許這個人並非我們的不明嫌犯 只是解案的其中一環
This probably isn't our unsub, just a piece of the puzzle.

324
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,540
看來我們是錯了
I could get used to this.

325
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,590
這絕對不是破房子
This is definitely not poorly maintained.

326
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,710
這堥S有一樣東西符合側寫的
One of these things does not belong.

327
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,380
Garcia 能幫我查個車牌嗎?
Hey,garcia,can you run a plate for me?

328
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,340
這不是我們要找的傢伙吧? 我非常懷疑
This isn't our guy,is it? I highly doubt it.

329
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,680
諸位有何貴幹? 你是Dante嗎?
May I help you guys? Dante?

330
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,740
不是 你不是那個歌手嗎?
No. You're not the singer?

331
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,370
Dante不是我的名字 他是我扮演的 一個角色  那你們是誰?
Dante's not my name. He's a character I play. So who are you guys?

332
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,760
我們是來調查一項謀殺… 先生!
We're investigating a murder… Sir!

333
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,320
你介意跟我們回去回答幾個問題嗎?
Would you mind coming in to answer a few questions?

334
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,210
Prentiss你在做什麼?
Prentiss, what are you doing?

335
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,800
這輛車是Erin Hickman的 那個受害人的車
That car is erin hickman's car. The victim's car.

336
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,510
先生你介意跟我們走一趟嗎?
Would you mind coming in,sir?

337
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,440
我是Elizabeth Chambers 正在洛城警局外繼續關注事態發展
This is elizabeth chambers outside the los angeles police department with a story we're still developing.

338
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,760
唱作人Dante 因涉嫌近期在洛城地區
The singersongwriter known as dante has been taken into custody by the FBI

339
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,570
犯下一系列命案 已被FBI收審
As a suspect in a recent string of murders in the los angeles area.

340
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,660
多長時間了 有三十分鐘嗎?
What's it been,30 minutes?

341
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,740
你的音樂事業怎麼辦?
What about your music?

342
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,290
歡迎來到世界媒體之都
Welcome to the media capital of the world.

343
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,180
天啊
Oh,god.

344
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,700
怎麼這麼快來了? 天曉得 他們總是這樣
How the hell did they get here so fast? Who knows? They always do.

345
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,700
聽著 我們強行穿過去
Now listen up. We're gonna have to push through.

346
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,390
你們能不能至少給我披個 夾克什麼的?
Can you at least put a jacket over me or something?

347
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,780
要衝出去的話 現在就得沖
If we're gonna go we gotta go now.

348
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,050
退後! 所有人退後! 退後!
Back off! Everyone back off! Back off!

349
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,490
麻煩退後! 退後! 退後!
Back up,please! Back up! Back up!

350
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,130
我是FBI的! 麻煩大家到這邊來 我有官方聲明
I'm with the fbi! I have an official statement if you'll just come over here,please.

351
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,410
他沒事吧? 他帶著槍了 別停下
Is he gonna be ok? He's got a gun. Keep moving.

352
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,880
就在這兒 非常感謝
Right in here. Thank you very much.

353
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,660
好的 現在這只是初步調查
Ok,this is just a preliminary investigation right now.

354
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,840
這事太不對勁兒了
A lot of this doesn't add up.

355
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,100
我們以前也犯過錯 從來沒錯這麼多
We've been wrong before. Not this much.

356
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,280
情況複雜了
The plot thickens.

357
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,370
十年前他因為家庭暴力被捕過
He was arrested for domestic violence 10 years ago.

358
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,440
有多嚴重?
How bad.

359
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,470
Garcia本來能找到備案的 可是案底都給清了 誰知道呢?
Well,garcia was able to find the battery charge, but it was expunged, so who knows?

360
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,470
歡迎見識名人司法世界
Again,welcome to celebrity justice.

361
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,920
他似乎很生氣 我很好奇原因
He's pretty agitated. I wonder why.

362
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,800
這兒的名人都不太習慣關號子
Celebrities out here aren't used to being put in the box.

363
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,330
可好像不止是不習慣的問題
This seems more than that,though.

364
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,020
那我不知道了 大家都對這幫人言聽計從的
I don't know. These are people everyone falls down around,defers to.

365
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,130
他們習慣別人說好話
Adulation is their norm.

366
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,040
Prentiss 你去審他也許不錯 我?
You know,prentiss, that may be a good way for you to play him. Me?

367
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,680
你是指證他的人 他也許把你看成是敵人
You were the one who pointed at him. He may see you as an adversary.

368
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,780
讓他放下戒心
Have him offguard.

369
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,620
你怎麼和那幫記者說的?
So,what did you tell the press?

370
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,160
我鄭重聲明了我討厭洛杉磯 這兒怎麼樣?
My official statement was that I hate los angeles. What's happening?

371
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,770
Prentiss打頭陣 好辦法
Prentiss is gonna take the lead. Good choice.

372
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,630
記住 如果他是不明嫌犯 他會對自己的 精神紊亂感到羞愧 利用這一點
Remember, if he is the unsub, he's ashamed of the disorder, so use that to your advantage.

373
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,390
跟他說 你不能相信他會做出這種事
Tell him you can't believe that someone like him could do this.

374
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,410
扔給他一根救命繩 好
Throw him a lifeline. Right.

375
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,440
問他要簽名
Ask him for his autograph.

376
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,860
對 對啊 拍他馬屁
Right. Right. Adulation.

377
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,990
Davies先生 請坐 別緊張
Mr. Davies. Have a seat,relax.

378
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,300
別緊張? 我怎麼能他媽的不緊張?
Relax? How the hell am I supposed to relax?

379
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,900
請坐下
Please sit.

380
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,110
我一直打電話給我的經紀人 但沒有信號
I've been trying to call my manager, but I can't get a signal.

381
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,280
審訊室一般都沒有網絡
These interrogation rooms don't usually have cell service.

382
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,260
那我能用什麼別的電話嗎?
Is there another phone that I can use?

383
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,660
我… 我覺得一定是什麼地方搞錯了
I…i think there's been a really big mistake.

384
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,950
沒有什麼搞錯的地方
There's been no mistake.

385
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,040
我相信你和這些命案沒什麼瓜葛
I'm sure that you couldn't have had anything to do with what's happened.

386
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,430
是嗎? 可是你帶我來這兒的啊
Really? I mean,you're the one that brought me in here.

387
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,510
警方給我的有些信息並不準確
The police gave me some bad information.

388
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,610
你不是警察? 好 把他搞糊塗了 精神分裂病人分不清
You're not the police? Good,she's confusing him. Schizophrenics can't follow that.

389
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,880
我們倆都不應該待在警局的審訊室
Neither one of us is the type of person who belongs in a police interrogation room.

390
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,450
我是FBI的特別督察探員Emily Prentiss
Supervisory special agent emily prentiss, federal bureau of investigation.

391
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,320
FBI的?
Fbi?

392
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,010
當然了 你是誰我知道
And,of course, I know who you are.

393
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,420
你是我的偶像
I'm a big fan.

394
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,230
真的? 你很驚訝嗎?
Really? Does that surprise you?

395
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,740
對 是的 我很驚訝
Yeah. Yeah,that's a surprise.

396
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,690
好吧 在正式開始前...
Ok. Well, before we get started...

397
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,230
你不介意吧?
Would you mind?

398
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,810
介意什麼?
Would I mind what?

399
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,090
要我開口真挺難為情的 不過機會難得
Well,i hate to ask, but I don't usually get opportunities like this.

400
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,370
這他媽的算什麼? 你根本不是我的粉
What the hell is this? You're no fan of mine.

401
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,710
你們以為我是笨蛋嗎?
You people think I'm stupid.

402
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,860
這樣的自相矛盾應該會讓精神分裂的人 完全分不清東西南北的
That kind of contradiction should completely confuse a schizophrenic.

403
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,060
這說不通啊
They can't make sense of it.

404
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,170
我是不是涉嫌什麼了?
Am I suspected of something?

405
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,230
你新專輯的名字叫什麼 今天發的那張?
Wh'she name they canof your new album,t. The one that comes out today?

406
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,560
她是不是 死了? 是的
Is she… Dead? Yes.

407
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,480
手上寫著你新專輯的名字
With the name of your new album written on her.

408
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,260
這個詞組很常見 是嗎? 在我看來可奇怪啊
It's a common phrase. Is it? It seems a little odd to me.

409
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,030
是特製 不是泛指
The instead of a.

410
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,400
這個女孩呢 昨晚還跟你回家了
And this girl went home with you last night.

411
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,730
她也死了?
She's dead?

412
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,180
你能解釋一下嗎?
Can you explain that?

413
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,660
我... 我不... 我不記得了
I…i don't… I don't remember.

414
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,900
你不記得傷害她了? 不 不記得
You don't remember hurting her? No. No.

415
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,050
她們的血都流乾了
Their blood was drained.

416
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,490
是喉嚨上的小孔堿y出來的 什麼?
From holes in their throats. What?

417
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,730
你是吸血鬼嗎 Davies先生?
Are you a vampire, mr. Davies?

418
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,540
你這是開玩笑吧
You can't be serious.

419
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,130
那只是我扮演的角色 舞台角色
It's a character I play, a stage act.

420
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,120
有時候事情會失去控制的
You know,sometimes things get out of hand.

421
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:25,180
不 不會的 這也... 太瘋狂了
No,no. This is…this is crazy.

422
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,070
我不知道那女孩怎麼會成那樣的
I don't know how that girl ended up like that.

423
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,420
我要叫我的經紀人過來
I think I need my manager here.

424
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,630
你得自己回答問題 好孩子
You're gonna do this all on your own, just like a big boy.

425
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,210
可我有權請律師
But I have the right to a lawyer.

426
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,680
你要叫律師嗎? 不
Are you asking for an attorney? No.

427
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,510
我請求與我經紀人聯繫 讓他去請律師
I'm asking to speak to my manager so he can find one.

428
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,800
我要電話 我要打電話 我得打電話
I need a phone. I need to make a call. I need to make a call.

429
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,140
律師沒來 他不願說你也沒辦法 Prentiss
There's nothing you can do when they lawyer up,prentiss.

430
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,110
Reid博士 Spence 怎麼樣了?
Dr. Reid here. Spence,what's going on?

431
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,420
嫌犯是個什麼搖滾歌星
The possible suspect's some sort of rock and roll star.

432
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,310
不是吧? 真的 但很多東西都不符合我們的側寫
Seriously? Yeah. A lot of it doesn't fit the profile,though.

433
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,130
我能幫上什麼忙嗎? 媒體倒是特別關注
Anything I can do? There's a lot of media attention.

434
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,600
好的 我已經到Gina家了
All right.Well, I'm already here at gina's house,

435

我先搜集點資料 一會就回去 太好了 謝謝你
so let me get some info and i'll be back. Great. Thank you so much.

436
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,990
這些表現都說不通啊 對
None of this makes any sense. No.

437
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,860
電視上說他的新專輯都賣翻天了
Television is saying his new record is selling through the roof.

438
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,460
所有周邊商品都是
All of his stuff is.

439
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,030
就在他被懷疑是連環殺人犯的消息 公佈以後
As soon as his being questioned in an actual string of murders became public.

440
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,230
那句話怎麼說來著? 能露臉就是好宣傳
What do they say? Any publicity's good publicity.

441
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,780
我們該拿他怎麼辦呢?
What are we gonna do with him?

442
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,390
Hotchner
Hotchner.

443
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,730
既然他要聯繫經紀人
Well,he wants to talk to his manager,

444
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,780
那我們也許可以讓他聯繫 看看對方知道些什麼
so maybe we let him make that call and find out what that guy knows.

445
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,340
值得一試
It's worth a try.

446
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,240
你確定? 好的 謝謝 有事?
You sure? Ok,thanks. Something?

447
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:58,430
實驗室打來的 受害人喉嚨上的 唾液樣本 DNA顯示是女性的
That's the lab. The saliva samples from the victims' throats… the dna's from a woman.

448
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,180
別敲了 別敲了 奶奶在睡覺 她會被吵醒的
Stop. Don't to that. Grandma's asleep. She's gonna wake up.

449
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,320

A woman? That's incredibly rare. But not impossible.

453
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,060
是 但Renfield癥發展到如此程度 一般不會這樣的
No,but renfield's with this type of aggression… it almost never presents this way.

454
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,260
我們就覺得什麼地方不對了 我們的側寫從來沒這麼離譜 Reid
Ok,we knew something was wrong. Our profiles have never been this far off,reid.

455
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,520
再看看資料 朝女性的方向找 看我們有什麼地方遺漏了
Go back and work it with a woman. See if there's anything we may have missed.

456
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,930
是你要打電話給你的經紀人
You wanted to call your manager.

457
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,320
我能有點隱私嗎? 沒這規矩
Can I have some privacy? That's not how it works.

458
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,130

Look,there's nothing that could be tied to you, absolutely nothing.

467
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,390

這事你知道的越少越好
The less you know about it the better.

471
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,740

00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,860
你有地址嗎? 有 我想JJ現在已經在那了
Do you have an address? Yeah. I think jj is there right now.

500
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,100
我們走
Let's go.

501
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,000
這他媽的是誰?
Who the hell is she?

502
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,940
我太沮喪了 所有事情 都被搞砸了太糟了
I'm so upset. It's all going to go bad.

503
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,580
別這麼想了 你必須...必須殺了她
Forget that. You've got… you've got to kill her.

504
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,370
一切都搞砸了
It's all going bad.

505
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:18,650
聽我說 我們必須幫助Dante 你必須再幫Dante一次
Listen to me, we've got to help dante. You gotta help dante again.

506
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,910
Dante? 沒錯
Dante? Yeah.

507
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,080
他...他...他會生氣的
He's…he's… he's gonna be angry.

508
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:28,460
不 不不不 我保證 你不殺了這女人 他才會生氣呢
No,no,no,no. I promise. He'll only be angry if you don't kill this woman.

509
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:35,640
聽著 你得再多殺一個女孩 才能加入他 成為不死族 明白?
Listen, you gotta hurt one more girl and then you'll be able to join him in the undead. Ok?

510
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,450
她一直沒接 繼續打
She isn't answering. Keep trying.

511
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,040
你只要再多殺一個 Dante就能活了 就一個?
You just have to do one more and dante will be able to live then. Just one?

512
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,130
就再殺這一個女孩 然後你就可以 跟我們說好的那樣 加入不死族了
Just this one more girl and then you can join the undead, just like we promised.

513
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,620
你說過Tara是最後一個了 你是這麼說的 你說過的
You said that tara was the last one. That's what you said. You said.

514
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,430
現在又冒出來一個... 這是最後一個了
Now it's the other girl… this is the last one.

515
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,910
這是最後一個了 然後你就能加入Dante 成為不死族
The last one that you have to do, and then you can join dante and be the undead.

516
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,110
就像我們說過的那樣 記得嗎? 記得嗎?
Just like we talked about, remember? Remember?

517
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,430
就一個... 就再一個
Just one... Just one more.

518
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,730
然後是你自己 就像他承諾的那樣
And then yourself. Just like he promised.

519
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,470
就一個...好吧 就一個
Just one... Ok. Just one.

520
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,390
最後一個 最後一個 拿著 來 拿著
Last one. Last one. Take it. Go on,take it.

521
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,990
非常好
Beautiful.

522
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,870
她到哪...
Where did she…

523
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,920
不准動
don't move.

524
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,960
JJ? JJ!
Jj? Jj!

525
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,100
在後面!
In the back!

526
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,920
我的 這是我的 是我的 不能...不能給你
Mine. This is mine. It's mine. You can't… you can't have it.

527
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,050
走開 走開
Go away. Go away.

528
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,820
JJ
Jj.

529
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,640
舉起手來! 把手放在我能看見的地方!
Show me your hands! Let me see your hands!

530
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,710
沒事 沒事 把手舉起來!
It's ok. It's ok. Get your hands clear!

531
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,710
不不 求你了 你得...不不不!
No,no,please,you have to… no,no,no,no! No,no,no!

532
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,350
那血會變質的! 求你們! 別這樣!
The blood is going bad! Please! Please don't do this!

533
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,910
你帶武器了嗎? 沒沒沒
Are you armed? No,no,no. No. Go,go!

534
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,060
嘿 我和這事一點關係也沒有 這不是我幹的
Hey,i got nothing to do with this. Hey,it's not me.

535
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:31,170
是那妞干的 這和我一點關係也沒有
It's the chick. It's got nothing to do with me.

536
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,900
發生什麼事了嗎?
Has something happened?

537
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,280
是你的經紀人
It was your manager.

538
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,210
他利用了你的一個粉絲
He used a fan of yours.

539
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,610
什麼? 一個年輕女孩
What? A young girl.

540
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,260
她一直給你寫信 說她想殺人吸血
She'd been writing you letters about wanting to kill someone for their blood.

541
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,170
我從來...從來沒收到過
I never…i never received anything.

542
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,640
沒錯 他收了
No,he did.

543
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,180
而我想他大概是覺得 可以利用此事進行宣傳
And I guess he thought he could use it for publicity.

544
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,820
他是對的 你的新專輯賣得非常好
He was right. Your new album is selling very well.

545
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,960
我從來沒要求過這些
I never asked for that. Well...

546
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,720
他在哪? 你的經紀人? 他被拘留了
Where is he? Your manager? He's in custody.

547
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,190
他還好嗎? 我能為他做點什麼嗎?
Is he ok? Is there anything I can do for him?

548
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,750
他會需要個好律師
He's gonna need a good lawyer.

549
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,010
那女孩會怎麼樣?
What about the girl?

550
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,760
不知道她最後會怎麼樣 她已經非常不正常了
I don't know where she'll end up. She's pretty sick.

551
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,260
如果可以的話 我也希望能幫幫她
I'd like to help her, too,if I can.

552
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,540
這就結束了? 我現在可以走了?
That's all? I can go now?

553
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,240
這就結束了
That's all.

554
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:39,600
你知道嗎 我真正想做的 就只有做音樂而已
You know,all I really ever wanted to do was make music.

555
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,790
但我不清楚究竟何時起 我覺得這不夠了
And I'm not sure when that stopped being enough.

556
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,460
嘿 你們覺得Davies會繼續 以Dante的身份演出嗎?
Hey,do you guys think davies will continues to perform as dante?

557
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,550
那個角色應該對四名女性的被害 負有責任
The character's probably responsible for the murder of 4 women.

558
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,100
要是他還有一點良知 Dante會隨她們而逝
If he has any conscience at all, dante died with them.

559
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,350
謝謝 你還好嗎?
Thanks. Are you ok?

560
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,440
沒事 醫生說會疼一陣子 但我沒事 真的
Yeah. Doctor said it'll be sore for a while, but I'm fine,really.

561
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,350
沒跟你一起去見Gina 我覺得太過意不去了
I feel so bad I didn't go with you to interview gina.

562
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:22,350
Spence打住好嗎? 我們根本不可能 預知她會是個危險人物
Spence,stop, all right? We had no way of knowing she was gonna be dangerous.

563
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,850
她只不過是受害人的朋友罷了
She was just the friend of a victim.

564
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,210
好吧我承認 是個精神分裂的朋友 外加一個反社會的搭檔
Granted,a schizophrenic friend with a sociopathic partner.

565
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,920
還有把鐵鍬
And a shovel.

566
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,710
說真的Reid 我們根本沒辦法預知 Gina內心會蘊藏著那樣的憤怒
Seriously,reid, we had no way of knowing that gina had that type of anger inside of her.

567
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,430
是啊 但是她對Dante著了魔
Yeah,but she was obsessed with dante.

568
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,500
我應該想到 那種程度的迷戀 會導致被人操控
I should have known that that level of fixation can lead to manipulation.

569
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,640
只有迷戀和精神分裂結合時才會出現 這我們根本無法預知
But only when the fixation's coupled with schizophrenia, which we had no way of knowing.

570
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,040
迷戀能邪惡到如此程度 還是讓我汗毛直豎啊
Still it never ceases to amaze me how dark obsession can get.

571
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,700
就為一個流行歌星?
And with a pop star?

572
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,170
我對"鼠幫"可著魔了 可絕不願意為Frank或Dean殺人啊
I mean,i was obsessed with the rat pack, but I wouldn't have killed for frank or dean.

573
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,170
五六十年代爵士演唱組 兩人是其中成員

574
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,530
不 你只會喝威士忌抽雪茄
No,you just drank whiskey and smoked cigars.

575
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,910
這話竟然出自 最愛專輯是 披頭士<White Album>的人之口
This from the man who's favorite record is the beatles' white album.

576
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,490
就算曼森(連環殺手)劫機 也別因此毀了大家對專輯的熱愛嘛
Just because manson hijacked it doesn't have to ruin it for the rest of us.

577
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,490
曼森指出該專輯中"Helter Skelter"的歌詞 應驗了自己的某一預言

578
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,460
這就是為什麼我一直鍾愛貝多芬
That's why I stick to beethoven.

579
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,460
曼森的女兒後曾試圖劫機殺死乘客 逼迫釋放曼森

580
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,030
絕對沒機會和犯罪扯上關係
There's no chance of guilt by association.

581
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,750
是啊
Well,yeah.

582
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:16,740
有部電影叫"發條橙"你看過嗎?
Have you ever seen a movie called "a clockwork orange"?

583
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,830
作家Cyril Connolly曾說過
Writer cyril connolly said,

584
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,230
"為自己寫作無人問津
"better to write for yourself and have no public

585
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,140
好過為人寫作失去自我"
than to write for the public and have no self."

586
