1
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,110
- Lorraine - 你終於來了
- Lorraine. - There you are.

2
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,580
我為我的遲到表示歉意
I'm sorry that I'm late.

3
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,170
我正打算給你打電話
I was about to call you.

4
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,020
我深知不該讓一位美麗的女子如此等待
I should know better than to keep a beautiful woman waiting.

5
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,010
你嘴真甜
Oh,laying it on thick,aren't you?

6
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,460
我已經期待多時了
Oh,I've been looking forward to this.

7
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,800
為你準備了一份計劃書
Got a prospectus for you.

8
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,550
先吃飯 你喜歡蟹肉沙拉嗎?
Food first. Do you like crab louie?

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,710
- 喜歡 - 這堸絞o簡直棒極了
- I do. - It is so good here.

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,710
是用海灣新鮮的石蟹製作的
They use stone crab fresh from the bay.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,700
要是你想吃肉 這兒的肉片也正宗 紅燴牛膝也很棒
The filet is wonderful if you're in the mood for meat,or the osso bucco.

12
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,150
Henry
Henry.

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,210
你怎麼了?
Hello.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,300
抱歉
Sorry.

15
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,790
我還在想工作上的事 確認一個客戶的存款
My head is still at work, Making sure I deposited a check for a client.

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,930
我現在也你是你的客戶
Well,I'm a client,too.

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,860
這會兒我雇著你呢
And you're on my time now.

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,640
- 全身心為你服務 - 但願如此
- You have my full attention. - I better.

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,270
我有你想要的東西
I have something you want.

20
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,650
只能畫到這個程度嗎?
This is all you have on him?

21
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,610
閉路攝像頭只拍攝到了他的後腦勺 沒任何價值
We have the back of his head from a few cctv angles, Nothing that helps.

22
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,630
他很小心的避開了攝像頭
He's careful to avoid being seen on camera.

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,140
我還有很多案子  這傢伙只算是一個小角色
Out of all my cases, this guy was never flagged As top priority,

24
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,610
但這起謀殺案確實很特殊
But this murder changes everything.

25
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,360
你交給我們處理是明智之舉 我們會解釋緣由的
You were right to call us. We'll explain why.

26
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,280
各位  這位是聖地亞哥 高智商犯罪偵查科的Russell Goldman探員
Everyone,this is agent russell goldman From the san diego white collar team.

27
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,930
你已經見過Hotchner探員
You've already met agent hotchner.

28
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,640
這些探員是Rossi Morgan Prentiss Reid
These are agents rossi, morgan,prentiss,and reid.

29
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,540
榮幸之至
A pleasure.

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,170
這次是高智商案子?
So we're working a white collar case?

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,510
算不上
Not exactly.

32
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,010
我跟蹤一名詐騙犯長達五年
I've been following a con artist for 5 years.

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,610
兩天之前 我認為他犯了命案
Two nights ago,I think he killed someone.

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,230
Carla Marshall被發現死在邁阿密的家中
Carla marshall of miami was found dead in her home.

35
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,920
勒脖窒息死亡
Asphyxiation by strangulation.

36
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,450
頭部受傷
She also had trauma wounds to the head.

37
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,290
為什麼你覺得是被那騙子所殺?
Why do we think the con man killed her?

38
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,290
上周Carla曾聯繫一個防騙術網站 聲稱自己受騙
Last week carla contacted a fraud website To report a scam.

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,200
這份投訴被遞交到了Goldman這
The complaint ended up On goldman's desk.

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,100
我們在電話中進行了詳談
We spoke on the phone at length.

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,230
她口中的描述 和我盯著的騙子出奇的一致
Her story matched my guy to the "t."

42
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,430
她本打算那天晚上和他對質
She planned on confronting him that night.

43
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,560
我告訴她中斷一切與外界聯繫
I told her to cease all communications

44
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,590
等我過去 我會飛去邁阿密 準備實行誘捕計劃
And wait for me,I'd fly to miami and set up a sting.

45
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,360
但最終計劃泡湯
But that never happened.

46
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,770
你有什麼實質性證據 確定這就是你要的人嗎?
Do you have physical evidence Confirming it's your guy?

47
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,790
還沒 但我和那女人談話當晚她就被殺
No,but for her to be murdered the night that we spoke,

48
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,980
我認為這不是巧合
I don't think it was a coincidence.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,860
沒有任何強行入室 盜竊 性侵犯的跡象
There was no sign of forced entry, theft,or sexual assault.

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,440
從犯案手法來看 動機可能是私人原因
And judging from the m.O.,the motive was personal.

51
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,360
- 他的騙術是什麼? - 金融欺詐
- What's his hustle? - Investment fraud.

52
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,390
基本上算是麥道夫一案的山寨版
Basically,he's a smaller madoff.

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,220
為了讓大家瞭解 這個騙子的騙術有多高明
To give you an idea of how convincing he is,

54
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,290
這是他過去14年的工作抽樣
This is a sampling of his work going back 14 years.

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,270
行騙纍纍啊
He's prolific.

56
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,350
他行騙金額數以千百萬
He's scammed hundreds of thousands of dollars from people,

57
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,210
但從未使用暴力手段
But he's never been violent before.

58
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,880
騙子一般不殺人 如果出了命案 那麼就是為了掩蓋罪行
Con men usually don't murder, but when they do, It's to conceal their crimes.

59
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,220
叫他們騙子 還真抬舉他們
Con man's a nice name for these guys.

60
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,570
從側寫看 他們通常有精神異常
They profile as psychopaths.

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,900
他們把手中的騙局視作戲場 把自己視作操縱木偶的傀儡
They see their cons as theater and themselves As a sort of puppeteer.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,900
必須能完全控制受害者 和自己的行騙過程
They have to have absolute control Over their victims and their cons.

63
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,610
也許正是因此他才開始殺人 因為控制不了了?
Maybe that's why he starting killing, Because he lost control?

64
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,370
關鍵是 有多失控?
The question is,how out of control is he?

65
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,700
如果他加速失控 那麼他周圍的人都有危險
Well,if he's spiraling, he's a danger to everyone around him.

66
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,050
因為魅力出眾 所以受害者根本無法覺察
And because he's so charming, The victims never see it coming.

67
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,300
我這錢要給誰?
Who do I make it out to?

68

難以置信 你們居然有專機
I can't believe you guys have your own jet.

78
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,350
我們輪流駕駛 你要不也試試?
We take turns piloting. You want to give her a try?

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,410
- 真的?  - 逗你玩呢
- Really? - No.

80
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,650
他使用了什麼反偵查手段 掩蓋自己的作案痕跡?
What kind of forensic countermeasures does he use To hide his trail?

81
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,940
偽造的身份證 一次性手機   已付費信用卡 異國銀行戶頭
Fake I.D.S,disposable phones, Prepaid credit cards,foreign bank accounts.

82
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,760
你追查不到他的海外賬戶嗎?
You can't track his accounts overseas?

83
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,520
可以 但要很長時間才能拿到銀行記錄
We can,but it takes months to get the records,

84
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,400
他寥寥數秒 就可以把錢轉了又轉
And it only takes him seconds To transfer money again and again.

85
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,890
查到巴哈馬群島的時候
By the time you figure out it's in the bahamas,

86
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,050
他已經把錢轉到瑞士或其他地方了
He's already moved it to switzerland or somewhere else.

87
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,630
他總能遙遙領先
I've always been too far behind him.

88
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,780
因為Carla的案子 我們現在離他近一點了
Well,we're a lot closer now because of carla.

89
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,770
最初是什麼引起了她的懷疑?
What made her suspicious in the first place?

90
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,220
她得把父親送進養老院
She needed to get her father into a retirement home,

91
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,040
當她聯繫這位"Grant Dale" 想要回自己的投資時
And when she called this guy grant dale to free up her money,

92
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,910
他沒有回她的電話
He never returned her phone calls.

93
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,490
騙子的本能是腳底抹油 而不是投入戰鬥
A con man's first instinct is flight,not fight.

94
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,590
他的殺人動機不是圖財   而是心理需求
What makes him kill, though,isn't financial, It's psychological.

95
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,960
我們需要關注的是 為何選Carla 為何是此時下手?
That's what we need to concentrate on. Why carla and why now?

96
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,560
Morgan和Prentiss 去她家看看
Morgan and prentiss,go to her house.

Goldman探員 為何不一起去呢?
Agent goldman,why don't you join them.

98
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,300
我把他的案子卷宗發回外勤辦事處了
I sent his case files to the field office.

99
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,720
需要我留下來幫你們查看案卷嗎?
Shouldn't I stay with you and help you sift through them?

100
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,980
我希望能獨立查看  得出我們自己的理論
I'd like to go through them independently, Come up with our own theories,

101
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,960
看是否能發現什麼行為模式 能夠讓我們搶先他一步
See if any behavioral patterns emerge That'll help us get ahead of him.

- Agent goldman's files are in that room down the hall. - Thank you.

104
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,770
- 有什麼需要請叫我 - 謝謝
- Let me know if you need anything. - Thank you.

105
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,640
開什麼玩笑
You're kidding me.

106
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,710
我們要看完這麼多?
We have to go through all of this?

107
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,900
高智商犯罪總會留下書面記錄
White collar cases often come down to a paper trail.

108
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,530
也許不會很糟糕 至少很有條理
Maybe it won't be so bad. I mean,at least it's well organized.

109
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,140
這是他的活  在桌子前坐上一天 查看書面證據
That's his job. He sits at a desk all day And accumulates paper evidence.

110
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,990
好了 Dave你研究受害者
All right. Dave,you work victimology.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,060
Reid 看能否找出他的行程模式
Reid,see if you can find anything in his travel patterns.

112
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,620
JJ 我們一起在黑板上畫個時間軸
Jj,let's get a timeline up on the board.

113
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,110
她是個房產經紀人
She was a real estate agent.

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,240
她一個人過得很好  直到William走進她的生活
She was doing well for herself Until william came into her life.

115
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,210
為什麼這麼稱呼他?
Why do you call him that?

116
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,150
在他早期的行騙中 他好幾次自稱是Bill Billy或者Will
He introduced himself as bill, billy,or will Several times in his early cons.

117
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,730
我猜他的真名可能是William這種類型的
My guess is that his real name May be some form of william.

118
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,060
他的大部分受害者都很富有 對吧?
So most of his victims were very wealthy,right?

119
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,740
你該瞧瞧他們的豪宅
You should see some of their mansions.

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,710
我轉悠了一圈 這房子很不錯 但不算豪華
Well,I'm looking around this house and it's nice, But no mansion.

121
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,610
她的投資沒像其他客戶那麼多
She didn't invest as much as his other clients either.

122
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,900
我好奇他為什麼盯上她
I wonder why he targeted her.

123
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,890
可能在其他方面對他有用
She may have been useful to him in some other way.

124
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,430
嘿 Goldman  他對Carla行騙時 使用的別名是?
Hey,goldman. What was the alias he was using with carla?

125
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,200
- Grant Dale - 來看看這個
- Grant dale. - Come check this out.

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,140
- 他建了個網站 - 警察怎麼沒有發現這個?
- He set up a website. - Why didn't the detectives find this before?

127
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,330
當地警察不會想到去找這個
The locals wouldn't know to look for it.

128
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,960
只有一個頁面 普通的投資信息
Well,it's only one page. Generic investment information.

129
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,550
既沒有聯繫方式 也沒有他的照片
I mean,there's no contacts, there's no picture of himself.

130
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,830
是沒有 只有漂亮汽車和房子的照片
No,just photos of nice cars and houses.

131
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,530
他在兜售成功的夢想
So he's selling the fantasy of success.

132
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,890
他的網站頁面很簡單 像是個標準模板
His web design is pretty basic. I mean,it's like a standard template.

133
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,430
很簡單就能建成
It would be fairly easy to set up.

134
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,670
- 可能是他還建了其他網站 - 我給Garcia打電話
- Maybe he created others. - I'm gonna call garcia.

135
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,640
親愛的 是我 我開了免提
Hey,baby girl,it's me. You're on speaker.

136
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,110
親愛的呀 誰聽不重要 反正每次都是你~
Oh,sug,I don't care who hears it. It's always been you.

137
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,740
聽好 我剛給你發了鏈接
Listen,I just emailed you a link.

138
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,230
- 收到了 - 是不明嫌犯的網站
- Got it. - It's the unsub's website.

139
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,250
你是不是想讓我查他怎麼支付 然後找到他的行蹤?
Do you want me to find out how he paid For his hosting services, track him down that way?

140
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,850
最終都會回到同一個止回序列
We'll run into the same backstopping trail.

141
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,490
你說的沒錯 這個確實無法跟蹤
Oh,you are right. That's untraceable.

142
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,190
好吧 不管這個了 你能不能查一下有相同內容的網站?
All right,we'll forget that. Can you do a search for websites Containing the same content?

143
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,370
查詢中...
And searching... And searching...

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,700
有一個...兩個...一共九個相同網站 一樣的文字內容 一樣的圖片
There are 1,2-- 9 identical websites, Same written content,same pictures,

145
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,320
除了名字不一樣
Just different names.

146
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,220
都是新的假名
These are all new aliases.

147
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,850
他從來沒有同時用過10個 這些都是新的
And he's never had 10 at once. This is all new.

148
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,540
- 我是Henry Moffet - 你騙了我
- I'm henry moffet. - You lied to me about everything.

149
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,770
你說什麼?
What are you talking about?

150
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,360
你的名字不是Grant Dale
Your name is not grant dale.

151
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,050
你為什麼要這樣對我?
God,why are you doing this to me?

152
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,660
- 冷靜 聽我說 - 不 你走吧
- Just calm down. Listen to me. - No,just leave.

153
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,860
你都不給我機會解釋
You're not giving me a chance to explain.

154
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,830
滾 不然我就報警了!
Leave or I'll call the police!

155
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,780
Grant...
Grant...

156
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,810
我是Henry Moffet
I'm henry moffet.

157
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,420
Henry Moffet
Henry moffet.

158
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,500
CIA最多會給每個特工2-3個假名
The cia assigns an agent 2 or 3 aliases at most.

159
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,140
再多了就容易搞混了
Any more than that, And it's difficult to keep the names straight.

160
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,190
而這個人有10個假名
This guy's juggling 10.

161
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,450
活在十種不同的生活中 多少要有些分裂了
Being all these people,that's gotta start Fracturing him somehow.

162
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,110
如果他的記憶過度緊張 這有可能造成他的失控
If his memory is strained, it could be causing him to lose control.

163
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,540
我們找到了他現在使用的假名 我們只需要找到客戶是誰
We have the current aliases. We just need to know who the clients are.

164
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,870
拿到了Carla的通話記錄
Got carla's phone records.

165
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,560
她死的那天晚上 給一個未知號碼打了很多次電話
She made several calls To an unknown number the night she died.

166
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,990
我追蹤了這個號碼 是一次性手機 那之後就沒有用過
I tracked the number. It was a disposable phone That hasn't been used since.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,510
那應該是不明嫌犯的號碼
That's gotta be the unsub's number.

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,970
他殺了她之後就把電話扔了
He tossed it after he killed her.

169
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,120
之前幾個月 她很有規律地在很晚的時候 給這個號碼打電話
Over the past few months, She routinely called this number Really late at night.

170
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,370
- 有多晚? - 深夜
- How late? - Like bedtime late.

171
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,340
不會有人在深夜和投資經理談生意的
You don't do business with your investment manager at bedtime.

172
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,720
那我們什麼時候再來過?
So,when are we gonna do this again?

173
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,760
我老公快回來了 所以...
My husband's coming home,so...

174
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,000
一段時間內我不會再見到你了
I won't see you for a while.

175
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,750
Grant...我會想你的 你騙了我
I'll miss you...grant. You lied to me About everything.

176
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,050
滾 否則我就報警!
Leave or I'll call the police!

177
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,210
Grant 你還好麼?
Grant,are you ok?

178
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,050
Henry 你還好麼?
Henry,are you ok?

179
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,090
我也會想你的
I'm gonna miss you,too.

180
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,110
Carla從來沒有提過和他有外遇?
So carla never mentioned anything about an affair with him?

181
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,300
沒有 但是要讓詐騙案受害人願意合作 是很難的
No,but it's always been a challenge with fraud victims To be totally forthcoming.

182
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,690
他們覺得被騙是很丟人的 他們通常都會有所隱瞞
They're so embarrassed about being duped, They don't tell you everything.

183
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,940
Goldman探長
Detective goldman.

184
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,430
- 我們想對比一下你的記錄 - 說吧
- We'd like to compare notes. - Shoot.

185
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,270
我在進行受害者研究
I'm looking at the victimology.

186
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,660
我們管這個叫喜好群體 一個意思
We say affinity groups. Same thing.

187
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,180
指的是有相同愛好的受害者
It refers to victims with shared interests.

188
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,510
好的 既然是在你們的領域 那就用你們的叫法
Ok. We're in your world, we'll use your terms.

189
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,420
你的檔案指出了他在前幾個案子中 的喜好群體
Your files point to specific affinity groups he targeted In the first few cities.

190
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,540
- 這個在你看來足夠具體麼? - 足夠具體
- Does this look accurate to you? - Yes,it does.

191
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,110
他離開聖迭戈之後 他的受害人就遍佈全國了
Once he got beyond san diego, His victims are all over the place.

192
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,640
沒有相同點
No shared interests.

193
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,300
我也是這麼個結論
I came to the same conclusions.

194
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,700
他不再使用喜好群體來挑選目標 他找到了其他的方法
So he stopped using affinity groups And found his victims somewhere else.

195
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,540
- 可是我不知道是用什麼方法 - 這也是我們要研究的
- Where,I don't know. - That's where we start.

196
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,900
<i>佛羅里達州 勞德代爾堡</i>
<i>******</i>

197
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,630
我是Randy Randy Randy
I'm randy. Randy. Randy.

198
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
我是Randy Summerland
I'm randy summerland.

199
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,920
我是Randy Summerland
I'm randy summerland.

200
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,030
幫我們多賺點錢 知道嗎?
Make us some money,ok?

201
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,780
沒問題
I can do that.

202
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,260
再說遍 你的名字怎麼拼?
Now,how do I spell your name,again?

203
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,320
M-o-f-f-e-t Henry Moffet 對沖基金 有限公司
M-o-f-f-e-t. Henry moffet hedge funds,incorporated.

204
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,450
Henry Moffet是誰?
Who is henry moffet?

205
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,710
Randy 誰是Henry Moffet?
Randy... Who is henry moffet?

206
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,510
我搭檔
It's my partner.

207
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,110
- 你從沒提過你有搭檔 - 沒有嗎?
- You didn't mention anything about a partner. - I didn't?

208
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,820
而且我上次的支票也不是兌給他的
And this isn't who I made the check out to last time.

209
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,790
他和我搭檔有幾年了
He's been my partner for years.

210
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,120
那我為什麼要付錢給他?
Then why am I making the check out to him?

211
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,310
理由很簡單
There's a simple explanation.

212
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,660
所以 不明疑犯和被害人在喝酒
So,the unsub and the vic are having drinks.

213
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,180
被害人拿出了支票簿和筆  寫上了日期 就只有這些
The vic has a checkbook and pen out, Check's dated,but that's it.

214
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,860
不明疑犯的錢就快到手了  可不知怎麼沒拿到 於是就下殺手了
The unsub got that close to getting his money, Somehow failed,and then did this.

215
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,390
這可是過度殺害 他把他的頭都砸爛了
And this is overkill. He bashed his head in.

216
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,350
他已經完全精神錯亂了 而且惡化地很快
He's completely unhinged and devolving fast.

217
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,610
可他自己還不知道
Only he doesn't know that.

218
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,250
他還想要工作  他不知道自己隨時都可能失去控制
He's still trying to go to work And he doesn't know he's in danger of losing it at any minute.

219
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,730
就像功能性酗酒者
Like a functioning alcoholic.

220
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,630
不明嫌犯把所有的精力 都投在了這些騙局上
The unsub channels all of his energy into these cons,

221
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,440
一旦騙局失敗 這就是他的應對
And when the con falls apart, This is how he handles it.

222
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,250
你認識Randy多久了?
How long have you known randy?

223
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,900
過去幾個月 我們和他經常在一起
We spent a lot of time with him In the last couple of months.

224
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,060
他幫我們投資
He was helping us invest.

225
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,010
你們給了他多少錢?
How much money did you give to him?

226
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,280
他一直說 在市場上我們需要積極
He just kept saying we needed to be aggressive in this market.

227
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,290
我的天 這都是我的錯
Oh,my god, This is all my fault.

228
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,030
- 什麼意思? - 是我認識的Randy
- What do you mean? - I met randy.

229
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,510
是我把這個男人引入了我們的生活
I brought this man into our lives.

230
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,970
Mckelson夫人 你和Randy之間還有其他的關係嗎?
Mrs. Mckelson, Is there anything more to your relationship With randy?

231
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,620
最終我們都會發現的
We're gonna find out eventually.

232
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,520
發現什麼?
Find out what?

233
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,870
他所說的Randy並不是他自己
Randy wasn't who he said he was.

234
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,490
- 甚至Randy這名字也不是真實的 - 什麼?
- Randy wasn't even his real name. - What?

235
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,260
我們認為這個男人 利用自己的長相和魅力來引誘女人
We think this man is using his looks and his charm To target women.

236
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,250
所以說還有其他人咯
So there's others.

237
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,920
我居然和一個殺我丈夫的男人上床
I laid in bed next to the man Who killed my husband.

238
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,240
他們有私情嗎?
Did they have transgressions?

239
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,070
這事讓她快崩潰了
She's pretty beat up over it.

240
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,500
Randy 誰是Henry Moffet?
Randy,who is henry moffet?

241
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,210
爸爸?
Daddy?

242
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,150
你回來啦!
You're home!

243
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,500
嘿 早上好啊 夥計
Hey,good morning,buddy.

244
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,380
讓我看看你
let me look at you.

245
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,440
你可真是個帥小伙 你發現沒?
You're a handsome devil,you know that?

246
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,500
- 我想你了 - 我也想你了
- I missed you. - I missed you,too.

247
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,140
Bill 你什麼時候回來的?
Bill,when did you get in?

248
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,310
- 就剛才 - 出差怎麼樣?
- Just now. - How was your trip?

249
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,880
- 不怎麼樣 - 抱歉 出什麼事了?
- It didn't really pan out. - Sorry. What happened?

250
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,430
我們能等JD去了學校再談嗎?
Can we,uh,talk about this after j.D. Goes to school?

251
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,300
我要吃薄餅
I want pancakes.

252
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,000
真的? 你要吃?
Really? You do?

253
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,350
成 那就給你薄餅吃
Well,then pancakes you shall have.

254
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,980
你不會覺得很帶勁吧?
You're not enjoying this,are you?

255
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,250
我喜歡在文件塈雿u索 讓我易於思考
I like a good paper trail. I find it meditative.

256
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,080
要你正常一次就那麼難嗎?
Is it really that hard for you to be normal just one time?

257
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,320
他又毀了另一個化名
He just burned another alias.

258
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,550
要是這人決定了要銷毀所有的化名
You know,if this guy's on a mission To eliminate all these aliases,

259
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,020
他會有系統地殺掉他的受害人
He's gonna systematically assassinate his victims.

260
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,750
Carla住在邁阿密
Carla lived in miami.

261
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,560
這次的被害人Frank Mckelson 住在勞德代爾堡北部
This victim,frank mckelson, lived north in ft. Lauderdale.

262
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,210
南佛羅里達都有可能出現被害人
The victims could be anywhere in south florida.

263
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,980
如果他是因為經濟形勢而加緊行騙
If he's working harder because of the economy,

264
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,430
那他擴大活動範圍就說得通了
It makes sense that he would expand his operating zone.

265

Prentiss and rossi are on their way back. We need to give the profile.

266
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,620
關於聖迭戈 這還有些問題
There's something else about san diego.

267
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,760
我發覺在他早期的案例中  他平均每個城市只待14到18個月
I noticed in his earlier crimes he only stays in each city An average of 14 to 18 months.

268
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,190
而他在聖迭戈待了3年半 然後再沒有在相同的城市待這麼久
Then he's in san diego for 3 1/2 years And then never in the same city for that long again.

269
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,450
聖迭戈有什麼 會讓他待這麼久?
All right,so what is it about san diego that made him stay longer?

270
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,080
繼續查下去 Reid 看看有什麼線索
Keep following that,reid. See where it takes us.

你確定?
Are you sure?

272
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,480
要是有選擇 我就不會搬了
I wouldn't be doing this if we didn't have to.

273
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,630
JD才開始交新朋友
J.D.Was just starting to make new friends.

274

What do you want me to do? The money has dried up here.

275
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,640
也許你可以休個假 多花些時間和JD在一起
Maybe you could take a break, Spend more time with j.D.

276
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,370

寶貝 我不想看到你壓力這麼大
Baby,I hate seeing you so stressed out.

278
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,620
我知道 可現在的經濟形勢快讓我崩潰了
All right,now,this economy is killing me.

279
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,850
- 我可以也去找份工作的 - 不
- I can get a job,too. - No.

280
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,700
不用 我一個人養得起我們
No,I can take care of us myself.

281
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,160
可我們得想個辦法 因為我不想再搬了
Well,we have to figure something out, because I don't want to move again.

282
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,760

Listen,we are moving to boston. End of discussion.

283
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,110

現在去整理東西吧
Now start packing.

Narcissism, Machiavellianism, And aberrant self-promotion.

287
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,290
也就是說 這個人以自我為中心
What that means is that everything revolves around this guy.

288
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,140
他使用不正當的手段控制和剝削他人

289
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,640

He's active in miami and ft. Lauderdale, But he could be in other wealthy communities,too.

302
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,640

Look at places like boca raton Or coral gables.

303
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,880
他現在頭腦中有太多的化名 讓他開始精神分裂
He has too many aliases in his head right now And it's causing him to fracture mentally.

304
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,240
這樣的失控激發了他的暴力 讓他變得危險
And it's this loss of control That triggers his violence and makes him dangerous to be around.

305
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,510

What forces a man to stay put in one place for a while, Downgrade his car,upgrade his house?

348
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,750
你認為他有家室?
You think he has a family?

349
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,020
這是晉陞為父親後的 生活方式的轉變
These are lifestyle changes a new dad would make.

350
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,520
他為什麼要成家?
Why would he start a family?

351
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,050
因為他想裝成普通人 家庭能讓精神病人看起來像正常人
Because he wants to appear normal, And a family does that for a psychopath.

352
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,650
妻子承擔看門人或主婦的角色
Wives usually serve a purpose, As a caretaker or homemaker.

353
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,080
後代是他們的自我衍生 同時滿足他們的自戀情節
They value their offspring As an extension of themselves And it also feeds their narcissistic ego.

354
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,380

357
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,770
如果他妻子沒有參與犯罪 她會一直使用真名
And if his wife isn't complicit in his crimes, She'll still be using her real name.

358
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,420
找到了他妻子 就找到了不明嫌犯
If we find the wife, We can find the unsub.

I'm really disappointed because you didn't say something sooner.

373
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,530
生命中需要的東西 你必須開口要
You know,if you want something in life, As a man,you need to ask for it.

374
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,950

550
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,700
求你了 Bill 他沒必要看到我們這樣

How long did you think you were gong to get away with this,hunter?

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,030
是的 你那一槍還是情有可原

他為什麼要那麼做? 他有妻兒
Why did he do that? He had a wife,a son.
