1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,940
艾凡斯頓  懷俄明州

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,810
我已與你為敵
I have made you an

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,810
為敵
enemy

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,540
亦與自己為敵
I have been my own

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,010
"為敵"
enemy

6
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,570
我在默默請祈
I am asking

7
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,030
你的寬恕降臨
for you to forgive me

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,630
為不堪的過去
for everything

9
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,480
若你難以釋懷
if you don't

10
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,630
那也值得憐憫
you're worthy of compassion

11
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,220
若你寬宏大量
if you do

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,200
你便更勝一籌
you're a better man than I am

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,910
若你心有不知
if you don't know

14
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,180
你我本是一家
you're my family

15
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,910
我內心之敵
enemy

16
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,940
我充滿歉意
I'm sorry

17
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,740
好  我會盡力而為
Ok. I'll see what I can do.

18
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,010
謝謝
Thanks.

19
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,410
我還不能確定這個案子的性質
I'm not sure what we have here

20
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,440
但懷俄明州尤因塔縣的Samuel治安官
but I just got a call and some case files

21
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,910
給我發來了一些案件卷宗
from a Sheriff Samuel in uinta county   wyoming.

22
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,760
6天前夜  分別發現有兩名青少年
6 nights ago   two different teens were found hanging

23
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,080
在自己的臥室中自盡而死
in their bedrooms.

24
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,890
自盡
Hanging?

25
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,690
發現Trish Leake時  她已窒息而死
Trish Leake was dead when she was found.

26
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,430
Ryan Krouse在現場被救了回來
Ryan Krouse was revived on scene

27
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,060
但幾天後也在醫院堨h世
but then died a few days later in the hospital.

28
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,260
我知道我們不處理自殺案件
I know we don't handle suicides.

29
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,850
但在上週五  就在附近的幾個鎮上
But the previous Friday   two more boys

30
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,670
發現有兩名男孩在門背後
a few towns over were found hanging

31
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,420
自盡而亡
on the backs of their doors.

32
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,810
一周內在一個鄉縣上同時發生四起自殺案
4 successful suicides in the same rural county in a week?

33
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,060
這高於全國平均水平
That's   uh   way above the national average.

34
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,040
我知道
I know.

35
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
那些孩子並不是典型的自殺群體
These kids don't fit the pattern.

36
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,710
不濫用毒品  酒精和抗抑鬱藥物
No drug or alcohol abuse   no antidepressants

37
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,340
也沒有被拘捕紀錄
No prior arrests.

38
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,350
他們只是平凡的好孩子
These are just plain good kids

39
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,650
而他們在一個週五的晚上
who decided to hang themselves

40
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,080
幾乎同一時刻  決定自盡了斷
at approximately the same time on a Friday night.

41
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,310
只有當人感到束手無措
When someone feels trapped

42
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,350
身陷困境  深感絕望時
in what feels like a hopeless situation

43
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,410
才會扣動扳機  服藥自殺或自盡而亡
pulling the trigger or swallowing pills or hanging yourself

44
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,690
因為在他們看來  只有這樣才能解脫
Seems like the only way out.

45
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,930
但對那些孩子來說  根本沒有這些跡象
None of that seems to exist here.

46
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,610
這其中一定有問題
Something's really wrong.

47
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,900
Hotch  我能感覺到
Hotch   I can feel it.

48
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,010
聽著  所有的自殺事件都發生在週五
Look   all these events happened on a Friday.

49
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,580
今天是週三
It's Wednesday.

50
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,710
而我們現在手頭沒有其他案件
We're not on another case right now.

51
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,590
好吧  將其定性為可疑死亡案件調查
All right. Generate an equivocal death investigation

52
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,620
大夥兒上飛機再說
and get everybody on the jet.

53
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,870
到時再決定這起案子是自殺還是兇殺
We will determine whether these are homicides or suicides.

54
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,140
即使是自殺案件
And even if they are suicides...

55
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,800
這其中也定有問題
There's definitely something wrong here.

56
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
正在刻盤  刻盤完成
Burn in Progress. Disk Burn Complete.

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Trish Leake  Ryan Krouse

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:28,200
<font color=#FF7F00>犯罪心理 第五季 第13集</font>
<font color=#FF7F00>Criminal Minds S05E13</font>

59
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,477
生活如戲  樂在其中
"Life is a game. Play it.

60
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:48,587
生命似金  敬請珍重
Life is too precious. Do not destroy it."

61
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:50,137
特蕾莎修女[著名諾貝爾和平獎獲得者]
Mother Teresa.

62
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:52,657
長官  我不是說我不想來
Sir   it's not that I'm not glad to be coming with you

63
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,517
相反我很想來  只是不知道為什麼要我來
Because I am. I just don't understand the why.

64
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:55,847
進行可疑死亡案件調查
One of the aspects

65
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,477
會涉及到
Of an equivocal death investigation

66
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:58,887
自殺的可能性
when suicide is a probability

67
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,957
如此一來需要進行間接人格評估
is an indirect personality assessment.

68
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:03,377
受害人都是網絡一代的孩子
Our victims are all internet generation kids.

69
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:05,007
在評估時  應該可以利用他們的電腦上
There should be invaluable personal data

70
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:07,737
寶貴的個人資料
on their computers to mine for the evaluation.

71
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:08,977
如果他們的確是自殺
If they committed suicide

72
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,907
那麼證據很可能就在他們的電腦
evidence of it will probably in their cyber world.

73
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:13,417
所以要我偷窺他們的電腦嗎
So I'm gonna snoop through dead kids' computers?

74
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:16,367
坐上這架飛機通常都沒什麼好事
This plane seldom makes pleasure trips.

75
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:18,157
我們瀏覽過卷宗了
We've all been over the files.

76
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:19,557
現在來分析一下受害人特徵吧
Let's talk about victimology.

77
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:23,217
四個孩子都是正派的學生
Ok. All 4 kids were decent students

78
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,557
住在不同的鎮上
from different neighboring towns

79
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:26,557
但在同一個縣學校唸書
but the same school and the same county.

80
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,227
活躍於社區和體育活動
Active in sports and community.

81
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,157
家庭完整  沒有精神疾病
Intact families   no mental disorders

82
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,757
最近沒有發生突發事件
No precipitating events.

83
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,097
他們不過是普通的乖孩子
These are just average good kids.

84
00:06:33,097 --> 00:06:34,757
肯定有什麼潛在問題
There has to be some underlying issue.

85
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:36,427
除了時間上的相對接近
Besides relative proximity

86
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:38,847
幾名受害人之間並無顯著關聯
there's no obvious connection between any of them.

87
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,897
似乎可以排除公開自殺約定這一點
It seems to rule out an overt suicide pact.

88
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:43,287
青少年自殺前的一些徵兆
The first few days leading up to a teenager's suicide

89
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:44,617
應該非常顯而易見
are usually very telling.

90
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:46,447
他們的行為極易被察覺
Their behavior is transparent.

91
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,457
有多種不同的指標在內
There's a multitude of indicators.

92
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:50,647
沒錯  但是這堥S有最普通的徵兆
Yeah   but the most common don't exist here.

93
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:52,517
沒有自殺的意圖
There's no prior attempts

94
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,707
沒有持續時間的重度抑鬱
no period of deep depression

95
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,377
沒有家庭成員突然離異
no withdrawal from family members

96
00:06:56,377 --> 00:06:58,857
沒有心血來潮的愛的表示
No spontaneous proclamations of love.

97
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:01,427
心血來潮的愛的表示
Spontaneous proclamations of love?

98
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:06,457
有時候  一個要自殺的人
Sometimes a suicidal person

99
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:08,067
在決定自殺的前幾天
in the days leading up to the act

100
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,897
會動不動對家人表示"我愛你"
will just blurt out "I love you" to family

101
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,807
這算是一種告別
sort of like a goodbye.

102
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,807
我們先調查最近的兩位受害人
We'll start with the latest two victims.

103
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:25,067
如果他們是自殺的  那我們得查出誘因
If they were suicides   let's find out what drove them to it.

104
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,067
懷俄明州  尤因塔縣  治安官辦公室

105
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:43,567
你們好  我是Rhonda Samuel
Hello. Rhonda Samuel.

106
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,527
你好  我是Jareau探員  我們通過電話
Hi. Agent Jareau. We spoke on the phone.

107
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:46,767
感謝你們特意趕來
Thanks for coming out.

108
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,407
大家聽說你們要來  都為之一振
My county's getting pretty shook up.

109
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,417
有個記者一直不斷來電話
I got this reporter won't stop calling.

110
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,567
我拖著他沒理
I'm holding him off   but he's connecting the dots

111
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:54,327
但他從案子的數量上推測出其中的關聯
on the number of suicides.

112
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,247
我該回復他嗎
Should I call him back?

113
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,137
不  目前不要
No   not just yet.

114
00:07:58,137 --> 00:07:59,597
對於何時向公眾公佈信息
We need to be very careful

115
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:00,987
我們得倍加小心
about when we release this information.

116
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:02,267
對這些死亡事件進行媒體渲染
Sensationalizing these deaths

117
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:04,137
可能會對其他孩子造成連鎖效應
may cause a domino effect with other kids.

118
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:05,747
專業術語叫做自殺傳染
The term is suicide contagion.

119
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:07,047
在一個群體中
The spread of suicidal thoughts

120
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:07,917
傳播自殺思想
among a group of people

121
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,267
有時會導致出現模仿行為
that sometimes results in copycat acts.

122
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:11,957
這種現象在青少年案件中尤為普遍
It's especially prevalent in teen cases

123
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,897
還有研究表明  一旦出現媒體報道
and studies suggest that media coverage

124
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:15,747
通常會提高死亡率
is sometimes associated with more deaths.

125
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,307
有沒有適合讓我們工作的地方
Is there a good place for me to set up?

126
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:19,407
我們沒有很正規的指揮中心
Don't have much of a command center.

127
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:20,997
沒事  設備我都帶來了
Oh   fret not. I got my own command center.

128
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,087
我只需要電源
I just need your juice.

129
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,397
沒問題
You got it.

130
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,327
你好  先生
Hello   sir.

131
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:40,367
我們是聯邦調查局行為分析科的探員
We're with the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit.

132
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:44,197
她明年高中畢業  她一直很興奮
She was so excited about graduating high school

133
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,197
她等不及要考大學了
She couldn't wait for her sats.

134
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:49,947
Trish有和誰在交往嗎
Was Trish dating anybody?

135
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:50,857
沒有
No.

136
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,877
Billy Sullivan
Billy Sullivan.

137
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:55,577
-難道就是那個  -沒錯
- It that who she's-  - Yes.

138
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:01,407
怎麼回事  Leake先生
What is it   Mr. Leake?

139
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,387
她上個月短信費超了100美元
She ran up over $100 texting last month.

140
00:09:04,387 --> 00:09:08,157
我們沒收了她的手機  還禁了她的足
And   we   um   we grounded her and we took away her cell.

141
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:10,417
不是我們  是我
Not we. Me.

142
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:12,967
是我的主意
I did that.

143
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,737
你怎麼不告訴我她有個男友
Why didn't you tell me she had a boyfriend?

144
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,257
因為你會抓狂
Because you would have freaked out.

145
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,207
我不會
No   I wouldn't.

146
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:20,577
你現在就抓狂了
You are right now.

147
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:21,677
不是因為得知她有個男友
Not because she had a boyfriend

148
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,207
而是她的死很可能是我
because I may have caused--

149
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:25,647
Leake先生  如果你女兒的確是自殺
Mr. Leake   if your daughter committed suicide

150
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,867
那並不僅是因為某些家庭懲罰
it wouldn't have been because of some punishment.

151
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,407
這其中有更複雜的原因
It's so much more complicated than that.

152
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:33,727
如果
If?

153
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,797
您說什麼
Excuse me?

154
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:41,217
你剛才說如果她的確是自殺
You said "If" She committed suicide.

155
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:47,707
能帶我們去看看Trish的房間嗎
Would you mind showing us Trish's room?

156
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,277
好
Yeah.

157
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,297
當然  這邊走
Sure. It's this way.

158
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:01,457
我就知道他不是自殺
I knew he didn't kill himself.

159
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:03,977
他不會讓我們承受這種悲傷
He wouldn't do that to us.

160
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,477
不好意思
I'm sorry?

161
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:12,287
你們來這兒的原因就是如此
Uh   that's   uh   that's why you're here.

162
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:15,117
聯邦調查局不會調查
The FBI wouldn't be investigating

163
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:16,777
一起自殺案件的吧
a suicide   right?

164
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,637
其實則不然
That's not exactly true.

165
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:20,357
有些時候  我們的確會進行一些
Uh   sometimes we do what's called

166
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:22,217
可疑死亡案件調查
an equivocal death investigation

167
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:24,777
試圖查清死亡原因
to try to figure out the manner of death.

168
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:25,977
結果可能
It may turn out that--

169
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:28,837
我們會盡量幫你們查清
Our investigation will try and sort it all out for you.

170
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:35,357
抱歉
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,177
她很多才多藝
She certainly was accomplished.

172
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,257
她的日記沒有反常之處
There's nothing unusual in her diary--

173
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:49,987
沒有憤怒  焦慮
No fury   no angst.

174
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:53,127
你們一定要查遍她的私人物品嗎
Do you really have to go through all her personal stuff?

175
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,857
她很注重隱私
She was such a private girl.

176
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:01,977
很抱歉  我們必須這麼做
We are terribly sorry to have to do this.

177
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,887
我們也關心Trish
We care about Trish

178
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:04,597
我們想確保
And we want to make sure

179
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,967
這樣的夢魘不會降落到別人的身上
this doesn't happen to anybody else's daughter.

180
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:08,497
Leake先生和Leake夫人
Mr. And mrs. Leake

181
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:10,227
有張表需要兩位填寫
There's a form I need you both to fill out.

182
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:11,587
能跟我來嗎
Can you come with me?

183
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:14,887
如果有任何需要
If you need anything...

184
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,697
謝謝
Thank you.

185
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,767
他們真可憐
Those poor people.

186
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,797
希望我們沒有給他們帶來更大傷害
I just hope we haven't made it worse for them.

187
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:26,247
可能嗎
Could we?

188
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:30,437
真的不用給各位拿點喝的嗎
Are you sure I can't get anyone something to drink?

189
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,247
不用了  謝謝
Yes   ma'am   thank you.

190
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,097
如果你改變主意
Well   if you change your mind...

191
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:38,777
你覺得她是被謀殺的嗎
Do you think someone killed her?

192
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:39,837
夫人
Ma'am...

193
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:40,697
Sharon
Sharon...

194
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:44,697
你為什麼說 "如果"她是自殺的
Why would you say "If" She committed suicide?

195
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,117
夫人  我
Ma'am   I--

196
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,097
為什麼她會這麼說
I mean   why would she say that

197
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,017
如果她不認為  如果她覺得
If she didn't think-- if she thought--

198
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:56,687
你為什麼這麼說
Why would you say that?

199
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:08,087
個人物品顯示她當時很自如
Well   personal touches show she was comfortable here.

200
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,417
入學備考書籍  大學名冊
SAT prep books   college brochures.

201
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:14,197
她不像個有高自殺傾向的人
She's a low suicide risk if I ever saw one.

202
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:15,297
確實  很明顯
Yeah   I think it's pretty obvious

203
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:17,347
Trish的生活很充實
Trish had everything to live for.

204
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:19,077
或許Garcia能從筆記本塈銗X
Maybe garcia will find something on the laptop

205
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:20,437
我們沒發現的東西
That we're not seeing here.

206
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:21,097
好的
Ok.

207
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,887
沒有隱匿之處
There's no secret hiding places.

208
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,277
也沒有毒品用具
Or drug paraphernalia.

209
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:34,307
這是Ryan的女友嗎
Is this ryan's girlfriend?

210
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,747
她叫Shaunna
Uh   Shaunna.

211
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,587
他們感情很好
They seemed really good together.

212
00:12:39,997 --> 00:12:42,077
他和Trish Leake交往過嗎
Did he ever date trish leake?

213
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:43,827
之前沒聽說過這個名字
I never heard of trish leake

214
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:49,867
直到週五在醫院見到她的父母
Until...When we met her parents at the hospital   uh   Friday.

215
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,817
看來他成績很好
Seems like he got pretty good grades.

216
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,327
還有封球隊教練寫的信
And this letter from the football coach?

217
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:02,737
Barswell教練要他明年加入校橄欖球隊
Uh   coach barswell wanted him to... be in varsity next year.

218
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,697
四分衛
Quarterback.

219
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:10,717
Ryan的電腦呢
Uh   where is ryan's computer?

220
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:15,137
家庭娛樂室埵酗@部
Um   we have--we have one in the family room.

221
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:16,637
他沒有個人電腦嗎
He didn't have his own?

222
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:22,737
我們擔心他上網時沒人看著
We were worried about   uh   unsupervised online time

223
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,597
所以要他在家人面前上網
So we wanted him in the middle of everyone.

224
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,517
我能帶你們去看看
I can--I can go show you.

225
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:28,047
如果告訴我們IP地址
Actually   if you just get us the   uh

226
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,257
我們的技術員可以
Network ip address   I believe our technical analyst

227
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:32,097
遠程控制檢查電腦
Can go over it off site.

228
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:34,567
如果能證明Ryan不是自殺
If it helps prove that ryan didn't kill himself

229
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,857
要什麼都可以
You can have anything you need.

230
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:42,147
準備好探究Trish的網上世界了嗎
Hey   you ready to delve into trish leake's online world?

231
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,687
你指的是極有能力
If by ready you mean extremely capable

232
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:44,957
但又不太情願吧
and even more reluctant.

233
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,707
差不多
Yeah   something like that.

234
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,277
Leakes一家怎麼樣了
How are the leakes holding out?

235
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:50,197
恢復得還好
Oh   probably as well as can be expected.

236
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,167
他們很堅強
Yeah. They're strong people.

237
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:52,997
那就好
Good.

238
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,287
真奇怪
Well   that's weird.

239
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:56,617
-什麼也沒有  -什麼
- There's nothing here. - What?

240
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:57,797
沒什麼可用的
Nothing useful?

241
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,047
什麼也沒有
Nothing at all.

242
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,507
連根目錄都沒有
Look   there's no root directory

243
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,607
也沒有操作系統
There's no operating system.

244
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,537
註冊表貌似空無一物
The registry appears to be blank.

245
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:05,737
可她幹嘛要裝一部裸機
But why would she have an empty computer set up?

246
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:08,377
我沒說是裸機  只說貌似空無一物
I did not say empty   I said appears to be blank.

247
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:09,077
什麼意思
Meaning?

248
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:10,567
意思是我要花點時間
I'm gonna need a little while.

249
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:14,557
JJ
Jj.

250
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:17,957
我知道  我不該說"如果"
I know. I know. I never should have said "If."

251
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:20,617
相信我  我絕不想
Believe me   the last thing I want

252
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:23,567
給這些家人雪上加霜
Is to make things worse for these families.

253
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:30,157
我沒有暗示這不是自殺
Look   I'm not invested in these not being suicides.

254
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:32,287
我只是想盡量
I just...want to try and

255
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,697
讓這週五不會跟上週五一樣
keep this Friday from being like the last two.

256
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:36,237
搞定了
I got it!

257
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:38,467
是個簡單木馬病毒作怪
It was--it was just a basic trojan horse.

258
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,367
只隱藏了磁盤目錄並沒有刪除
It just hid the directories   didn't erase them.

259
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:42,537
天啊
Oh   god.

260
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:43,467
怎麼了
What is it?

261
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,197
她死當晚上過窒息遊戲網
She was on a choking game site the night she died.

262
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,037
什麼東西
A what?

263
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:48,607
是個小孩玩的遊戲
Uh   it's a game kids play where

264
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,407
讓自己窒息以求亢奮
they choke themselves to get a buzz   to get high.

265
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,377
他們稱之為"好娃娃亢奮"
They call it the good kids' high.

266
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:53,797
即使沒有吸毒
You get lightheaded and a sense of euphoria even though

267
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:55,767
也能產生興奮感
no actual drugs are involved.

268
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,417
很多高中生會玩
It's something kids in high school play.

269
00:14:57,627 --> 00:14:58,927
Ryan有電腦嗎
Did ryan have a computer?

270
00:14:58,927 --> 00:14:59,857
他房堥S有
Not in his room.

271
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,007
-有遊戲機嗎  -有
- What about a gaming system? - Yeah   he did.

272
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:03,687
青少年會想方設法上網
Teenagers will find a way to get online.

273
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,967
我有IP地址
I have the   uh   ip address.

274
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,117
這個有用
Oh. That will help.

275
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,097
猜中  Ryan當晚也上了同一網站
Bingo. Ryan was on the same site on the same night.

276
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:14,937
這不是自殺
It wasn't suicide.

277
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:19,597
稍等  上面有語音
Hang on   this is a text to voice icon.

278
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:20,787
聽聽怎麼回事
Let's see what happens.

279
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,447
快試試
Come on   try it.

280
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:24,657
我們都試了  你敢嗎
We all do it. I dare you.

281
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,957
你敢嗎
I dare you?

282
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,837
有人精心策劃
Someone was orchestrating this

283
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:30,347
故意讓小孩扼死自己
Purposely getting the kids to choke themselves.

284
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:53,447
一定要關門
Make sure you close the door.

285
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:04,147
明天是重要一晚
Tomorrow's the big night.

286
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,217
我們都會玩這個遊戲
We're all gonna play the game.

287
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:12,977
這個遊戲有個小群體
There's a whole subculture around this game.

288
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,107
有各種名字  經常在派對玩
They make up names for it   they do it at parties.

289
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,917
有人教唆這堛漱p孩
But someone is daring these kids in this area

290
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,027
玩這種遊戲
To play the game.

291
00:16:20,997 --> 00:16:22,397
這是個競賽
It's a contest.

292
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:23,537
還有規則
And there are rules.

293
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:26,367
加油  Evans高中  接受挑戰
Come on   evans high   this is the big one.

294
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,177
Garfield高中上周擊敗Casper高中
Garfield edged out casper high last week.

295
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:30,927
你會讓他們踩扁我們嗎
You gonna let them diss us?

296
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:32,567
踩扁  真像小孩的口氣
Diss--sounds like a kid.

297
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,677
還有誰會讓學校間互相較量
Who else would pit schools against each other?

298
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:36,407
魯莽少年比賽
Reckless teenage competition.

299
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,867
本週五取得最長亢奮時間的學校勝出
The school that logs the most high time this Friday wins.

300
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,647
週五  明天
Friday   tomorrow.

301
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,207
快叫朋友來參加
Get your friends on board.

302
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,567
練習越多  亢奮越久
Practice makes the high last longer.

303
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,237
務必獨自嘗試  用網絡攝影機拍下過程
Gotta do it alone and video it with your webcam

304
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:50,987
上傳至本網站  以便記錄
And upload it to the site for it to count.

305
00:16:50,987 --> 00:16:52,917
獨自嘗試需要繩子
Doing it alone requires ligatures.

306
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,187
他基本上是慫恿小孩
He's basically encouraging

307
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,507
用最致命的方式玩
them to play the deadliest form of the game

308
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:56,747
且沒人能救醒他們
With no one there to revive them.

309
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,067
Garcia  關掉這個網站
Garcia   shut the site down.

310
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,467
長官  我完全能做到
Sir   I can totally do that

311
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:00,767
但我覺得不能這麼做
But I don't think you want me to.

312
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:01,557
為什麼
Why?

313
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:04,287
網站是目前唯一追查嫌犯的線索
Right now this site is our only way to track the unsub

314
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:05,657
如果我介入  他肯定會察覺
And if I cut into it   he will certainly know

315
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:06,437
我們在關注他
We're watching him

316
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:07,597
這樣一來  他會關掉網站
In which case he'll shut it down bring it back up

317
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:09,367
簡單改寫代碼
And he'll write a simple change in code

318
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,837
以更隱蔽方式重操舊業
In a more covert fashion.

319
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:12,687
而且不清楚有多少服務器
Plus there's no telling how many servers it's replicated on   anyway.

320
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:14,267
你說得對
You're right.

321
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:16,587
我們可以做側寫了
We're ready to give the profile.

322
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,577
這幾起謀殺案的不明嫌犯可能是一名少年
We believe the unsub responsible for these deaths may be a teenager.

323
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:22,937
他為人孤僻  不參與團體運動或活動
He's a loner. He doesn't participate in team sports

324
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:26,107
性格內向  自尊心很弱
Or group activities. He's withdrawn   very low self-esteem.

325
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:28,767
唯一與人互動的方式是上網
His only form of pure interaction is online.

326
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,197
從事能讓別人注意他的活動
He engages in activity that draws attention to himself

327
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:33,577
但又與同齡人有隔閡
Yet isolates him from his peers.

328
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:35,247
父母及老師應注意
Parents and teachers should watch out

329
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:36,827
以下可疑跡象
for the warning signs--

330
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:40,367
眼睛佈滿血絲  頸部有傷痕
Kids with bloodshot eyes   marks on their necks

331
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,597
或是有劇烈頭痛  眼神迷茫的孩子
severe headaches   disorientation.

332
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:44,817
他在現實生活中把自己歸為失敗者
In real life   he considers himself a loser.

333
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:48,027
在網絡  他用繩索讓自己變得強大
In cyberspace   he can pull strings   make himself powerful.

334
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:50,647
這孩子知道有別的孩子因他喪生嗎
Does this kid know that other kids are dying because of him?

335
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:52,677
他讓自己窒息並鼓勵其他人也這麼做
He's choking himself and daring others to do it

336
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:55,337
所以這極有可能是過失殺人案
So we're most likely looking at reckless homicides here.

337
00:17:55,337 --> 00:17:57,977
如果各位發現任何異常或可疑之處
It you see anything that's unusual or suspicious

338
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,827
請致電治安官辦公室
Just call the Sheriff's department

339
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:02,127
我們會盡全力給予幫助
And we will try to direct you as best we can.

340
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,777
謝謝大家
Thank you.

341
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,617
我們已經盡可能告知了更多家長
Well   we've told as many parents as we could.

342
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:15,367
你覺得有用嗎
Do you think it helped?

343
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:17,907
不如讓孩子們明白這些更有效
Not as much as getting through to the kids will.

344
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:26,397
窒息與過度換氣  這兩者
Two different mechanisms   strangulation and hyperventilation

345
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:30,387
都會造成腦部缺氧
Create the same effect- oxygen deprivation in the brain.

346
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:33,917
喂  小朋友
Hey   kid.

347
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:36,517
這可不好
Not a good idea.

348
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:37,717
讓我看下
Let me see it.

349
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,797
這哥們是從哪顆星球冒出來的
"What planet is this dude from?"

350
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,107
他不想讓咱們贏那個比賽
"He doesn't want us to win the contest."

351
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:47,667
我
Um...I--uh--uh--

352
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,717
我覺得更準確的表達應該是
I think the more accurate statement would be

353
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:54,277
他不想讓我們參加那個比賽
"He doesn't want us to participate in the contest at all."

354
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,857
這是Ryan的桌子  對吧
This was Ryan's desk   right?

355
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:57,817
他以前坐在這兒吧
This is where Ryan sat?

356
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:00,017
你們記得Ryan吧
You guys remember Ryan.

357
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:03,597
他踢足球  帶Shaunna去舞會
He   uh   played football. Took--took Shaunna to prom.

358
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:07,417
我猜你們中有些還跟他是朋友
I'm assuming that some of you were probably even friends with Ryan.

359
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,137
Ryan也曾想贏這比賽
Ryan wanted to win the contest   too

360
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:12,587
但是當他自縊時
But the way Ryan choked himself

361
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:15,037
腦部的供氧被切斷
He cut off all the oxygen to his brain

362
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,917
這向心臟傳輸了求救信號
which sent a distress signal to his heart

363
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,287
使得心臟跳動遲緩
Slowing it down.

364
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:22,187
接著  大腦為自我保護
Then his brain   in an effort to preserve itself

365
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:24,457
停止了所有非必要的身體功能
shut off all no n-essential bodily functions.

366
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:26,977
手臂  雙腿無法動彈
His arms gave out   his legs gave out

367
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:30,307
也就是說  他沒法解開脖子上的繩結
which means he couldn't loosen the tie around his neck

368
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:32,067
而此時  恐慌襲來
At which point panic set in.

369
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:35,007
Ryan最終心搏停止
And in Ryan's case   it escalated to cardiac arrest.

370
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,627
也就是說他的心臟停跳
Which means that his heart stopped.

371
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,097
繼而發生腦損傷
Brain damage began

372
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,567
在四分鐘內
And within 4 minutes

373
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,987
他就已經完全腦死亡了
He is completely and totally brain dead.

374
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:49,037
他在恐懼和巨大的痛苦中死去
He died scared and probably in a lot of pain

375
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:52,597
原以為一切盡在掌控卻無法終止
And unable to stop what he thought he completely control of

376
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,007
而所有這些都是因為他要參加那個
All because he wanted to participate

377
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,507
我覺得爛到透頂的遊戲
In what I consider to be a pretty- -pretty lame game.

378
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:04,117
所以  你的短信還真說對了
So   I mean   your text is actually completely accurate.

379
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:05,617
我不想你們贏下那個比賽
I don't want you to win the contest

380
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,217
因為我壓根不希望你們參加
Because I don't want you to play the game.

381
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,317
你們還真信這廢話
You all believe this crap?

382
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:17,347
你不信嗎
You don't?

383
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:20,687
怎麼不跟大家說說你是怎麼認為的
Why don't you come up here and tell us what you think.

384
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:25,167
好啊
Whatever.

385
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:38,967
站住
Hey! Hey   come here!

386
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:41,027
站住
Come here!

387
00:20:44,597 --> 00:20:46,007
小子  停下
Kid   stop!

388
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:56,697
沒事吧
You all right?

389
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:57,857
-放開我  -放鬆點
- Let me go! - Just relax.

390
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,247
-放開我  -別動
- Let me go! Then stop fighting.

391
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,077
別動
Stop fighting. Stop it.

392
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:02,227
放開我
Let me go.

393
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,017
沒事的
It's all right.

394
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:04,067
還好吧
You ok?

395
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,187
是的  沒事
Yeah. I'm fine.

396
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,317
你跑什麼
Why'd you run?

397
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:12,747
Morgan  看看他的脖子
Morgan   look at his neck.

398
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:14,557
讓我看看你的脖子
Let me look at your neck.

399
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:15,807
別碰它
Don't touch that!

400
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,997
我剛怎麼說的
Hey   what'd I say?

401
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:18,357
放鬆
Relax.

402
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:26,247
顏色不同表明正處於不同的恢復階段
Different colors mean different stages of healing.

403
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:30,147
你這麼做很長時間了  對嗎
You've been doing this to yourself for long time   havn't you?

404
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:33,207
大腦一定已經飽受折磨了
There's no telling how much his brain has suffered.

405
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,327
Reid博士
Dr. Reid.

406
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:39,957
你覺得就是他嗎
You think it's him?

407
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:41,657
很可能
He's a pretty likely candidate.

408
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,287
我是Wilson Summers
I'm Wilson Summers.

409
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,747
學校打電話給我說我兒子受了傷
The school called and said my son was injured.

410
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:48,887
Will
Will.

411
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,637
-你認識他  -工作上認識的
- You know him? - Professionally.

412
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:53,327
他在消防局工作
He works for the Fire Department.

413
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:54,857
治安官
Sheriff.

414
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,427
這是Reid博士
This is Dr. Reid.

415
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:58,797
我兒子還好吧  醫生
Ahh. Is my son all right   doctor?

416
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:01,207
事實上  我不是醫生
Actually   um   I'm not that type of doctor.

417
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:03,077
我為FBI工作

418
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:04,597
FBI嗎
FBI?

00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:07,767
你兒子一直在自扼頸部
Your son Christopher has been choking himself.

420
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:08,947
我不明白
I don't understand.

421
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:10,887
你知道最近有孩子死去的事情吧
You know the kids that have died recently?

422
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:12,367
那些自殺
The suicides.

423
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:14,237
他們可能不是自殺
They may not be suicides.

424
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:16,617
一個他這年紀孩子在玩的遊戲
It's a game that kids his age tend to play

425
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:18,577
他們使自己昏迷
Where they force themselves to pass out

426
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:21,277
為了達到興奮刺激的感覺
For the   uh   the buzz that it gives them.

427
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:25,257
Christopher穿哥特裝多久了

428
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,277
塗黑指甲  畫黑眼圈

429
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:28,337
有一陣了
A while.

430
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:30,997
他過得很不容易
He's been having a rough time.

431
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:32,317
怎麼了
Why's that?

432
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:34,607
幾年前 他的母親去世了
His mother died a few years ago

433
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:38,297
之後他就一直穿黑衣服
And he's been wearing black ever since.

434
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:42,077
他常耗在電腦上嗎
Does Christopher spend a lot of time on the computer?

435
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:45,147
只要一醒來
Just every waking...

436
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:48,347
為什麼這麼問
Why?

437
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:51,167
我們認為你的兒子可能建立了一個網站
We think your son may have created a website

00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:55,047
鼓勵孩子們在這個窒息比賽媊v爭

439
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:57,557

440
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:58,487
爸爸
Dad.

441
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:00,617

444

Will

445
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:09,557
等他檢查完
When he's done

446
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:11,857
我們要讓他來我辦公室談談
We're gonna need to talk to him down in my office.

447
00:23:15,717 --> 00:23:17,737
一整晚都沒有動靜
There hasn't been any activity all night.

448
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:19,477
還沒到週五
It's not Friday yet.

449
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:30,347
很感謝你讓我們查他的電腦
I appreciate you letting us take a look at his computer.

450
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:33,307
Rhonda  你們錯了
You're making a mistake   Rhonda.

451
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:35,137
Chris是個好孩子

452
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:37,867
我真心希望你是對的
I really hope that's true.

453
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:38,967
給你
Here it is.

454
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:41,947
一旦真相大白
Well   if this all works out

455
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:44,607
我保證馬上還給他
I promise I'll give it back to him as soon as possible.

456
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,472
Christopher  我們知道
Christopher   we know you've been

457
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,352
你母親去世後你過得很艱難
Going through a lot since your mother died.

458
00:23:59,352 --> 00:24:01,972
孩子 當發生不幸 我們會沮喪
When bad things happen to us   we get frustrated   kid.

459
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:04,892
而有時候我們會宣洩出來  做些不好的事
Sometimes we act out and we do things we're not proud of.

460
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:07,152
他心不在焉
He's not very engaged.

461
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:08,392
給他些時間
Give them some time.

462
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:09,432
快要週五了
Well   it's almost Friday.

463
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:10,662
沒剩多少時間
We don't have any time.

464
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:13,532
只要他呆在這  就沒法在網站上行動
Well   as long as he's here   he can't post Anything new to his website.

465
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:15,762
沒錯  但其他孩子還是會玩那遊戲
True   but the kids are still gonna play the game.

466
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:18,892
你們要的全部背景資料
Here's the full background you wanted.

467
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:19,602
多謝
Thank you.

468
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:24,062
難怪他這麼孤獨
No wonder he's a loner.

469
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:26,582
他母親去世後  他們搬了三次家
They've moved 3 times since his mother died.

470
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:28,302
失去了同齡人的幫助支持

471
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,022
兩年換了三所學校

472
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:32,902
對一個孩子來說要適應太不容易了
That is a lot of adjustment for a kid to have to make.

473
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:35,652
我想讓你知道我們會沒收你的電腦
I want you to know that we're going to be confiscating your computer.

474
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:37,422
我們的分析人員會做全面調查
Our analyst is going through all of it.

475
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,632
來揭開真相
So that we can uncover the truth.

476
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:41,292
當然
Sure you will.

477
00:24:43,422 --> 00:24:45,032
真相麼
Truth.

478
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,992
看起來他對我們會發現什麼並不擔心
He doesn't seem worried about us finding anything.

479
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:50,752
他們溝通得不是很順暢
They aren't building any rapport.

480
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,032
他們回來了
They're back.

481
00:24:57,592 --> 00:24:59,392
天吶  christopher這孩子真古怪
Mary   this christopher kid is fantastical.

482
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,742
他有一個分區硬盤
He's got a segmented hard drive

483
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:03,192
強大的防火牆  超長的密碼
Serious firewalls   major league encryption.

484
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:04,162
沒有必要這樣
No reason for all that unless

485
00:25:04,162 --> 00:25:05,922
除非他隱藏了些重要的東西
he's hiding something serious

486
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,642
那麼  這就是他不著急的原因
Ok   so that's why he isn't worried.

487
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,552
這個是  不正常的
This is--uhh! Unusual.

488
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,792
我發動的每一次攻擊都馬上被擊破
Every attack I launch is shot down immediately.

489
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:15,362
那是什麼
What's that?

490
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,522
有人剛剛上傳了一段新的視頻到這個遊戲網站上
Somebody just uploaded a new video to the game site.

491
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:18,492
12點01分

492
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:20,332
--現在星期五  --他們在玩
It's Friday. They're playing.

493
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:22,882
他們中遲早有人會出事的
It's only a matter of time before some of them go wrong.

494
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:24,432
夥計們  我現在沒有任何辦法了
Guys   I'm gonna keep dead-ending on this

495
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:27,012
我得弄清楚他的安全系統是如何設置的
Until I get a beat on how he set up his security system.

496
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,462
希望你有B計劃
Hope you got a plan "B."

497
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:40,882
Garcia  我覺得你跟其他人比
Garcia   I think that this kid

498
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:43,182
和這個孩子會有更多的共同語言
will relate to you better than anybody else.

499
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:45,872
我想讓你跟他談談  看看你能不能讓他開口
I want you to talk to him   see if you can get him to open up.

500
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:47,272
呃...
Um.

501
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:50,342
長官  我以前沒幹過這個
Sir   I have never done that before.

502
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,922
我搞砸了怎麼辦
What if I mess up?

503
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:53,782
你沒問題的
You'll be fine.

504
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,882
老弟  我叫 Penelope
Hi there. I'm Penelope.

505
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:18,782

介意我坐這兒嗎
Can I sit down?

507
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:23,012
你是個警察
You're the cop.

508
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:28,342
你看我像警察嗎
Um   I look like a cop to you?

509
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,402
是啊  你不是嗎
Yeah. What   you aren't?

510
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:31,292
不是
No.

511
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:33,712
聯邦調查局的技術員
FBI tech analyst.

512
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:36,912
我只是可以享用官方網絡數據庫

513

來調查你

514

一個怪胎女孩

515
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:40,912
挺酷的
Cool.

00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,282
時間可以撫平一切
Time is a great healer.

518
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:51,652
你不瞭解我的感受
You have no idea how I feel.

519
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:53,852
我在像你這麼大的時候
I lost my mom and my dad

520
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,702
失去了我的父母
when I was like you age though

521
00:26:56,892 --> 00:26:59,882
我也不知道  我想我很瞭解你的感受
I don't know. I think I have a pretty good idea.

522
00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:04,272
我感覺非常孤獨

523
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:06,762
直到我在網上安家

524
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:14,132
一直都這樣

525
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:18,802
喂  我  我沒騙你

526
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:20,512

謝了

529
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,342
你是哥特迷嗎
You into goth?

530
00:27:27,342 --> 00:27:29,022
我現在不應該迷這個
You know   I don't think I'm supposed to be anymore

531
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,262
但是我還是很喜歡
But the love is still there.

532
00:27:33,022 --> 00:27:34,102
那你是聯邦探員嗎
So you're FBI?

533
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,722
我知道這很不正常  可我就是喜歡
Yeah   I know. It's crazy   but I love it.

534
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:41,032
我也很喜歡你的耳環
I enjoy your earring   too.

535
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:42,152
從哪堬^來的
Where did you score that?

536
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:43,012
易趣上
Ebay.

537
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:44,332
應該是加勒比海盜
It's supposed to be johnny d.'s

538
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:45,542
強尼德普戴的那個
From that pirate movie.

539
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:46,812
太厲害了
Most awesome.

540
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:48,602
她做得不錯
She's good.

541
00:27:48,952 --> 00:27:51,872
她建立的溝通是Morgan和Reid所不能得
Established rapport when  and reid couldn't.

542
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,462
我們應該每次都帶著她
We should bring her out all the time.

543
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:56,392
那麼  你的全方位數據保護加密系統
Ok   your whole pgp disc encryption system

544
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:58,162
簡直酷斃了
Is like crazy impressive.

545
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:00,322
是啊  我對那東西很著迷
Yeah   I'm into that kind of stuff.

546
00:28:00,322 --> 00:28:02,932
東西  老弟  你沒明白我有多麼嫉妒
Stuff? Dude   you do not understand. I am jealous.

547
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,172
那可是最時髦的技術
That is state-of-the-art technology

548
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:05,682
一般人可玩不轉
The feeb does not have.

549
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,672
隨便吧
Whatever.

550
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,872
那麼  你是怎麼得到你的代理服務器的呢
Ok. How did you get your anonymizing service?

551
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:13,902
從一個網友的一個鏈接
I got it from some link from some dude online.

552
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:15,832
問這個幹什麼啊
What do you care?

553
00:28:15,832 --> 00:28:18,762
我只是覺得你設置整個系統的過程太酷了
I just think it's uber cool how you set your whole system up.

554
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:21,212
就像個碎紙機一樣
Like how you use an e-shredder

555
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:22,782
根本查不出你在網上的活動
To obliterate your net activity

556
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:25,342
並且有個雨刮器如同一個輔助垃圾處理器
And a window wiper as your secondary trash eraser.

557
00:28:25,342 --> 00:28:28,532
-誰做的  -所有人都這麼做
- Who does that?   - Everybody does that.

558
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:32,172
審問結束了
The interview's over.

559
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:33,592
審問?
Interview?

560
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,972
-我剛想  -他父親求援了
- I was just--   - His father invoked.

561
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:38,962
老爸
Dad.

562
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:40,752
我要給你找個律師
I'm getting you a lawyer.

563
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,532
你母親去世後我把事情搞的很糟  讓你失望了
I screwed up and failed you when your mother died.

564
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:43,802
這次不會的
Not this time.

565
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,202
如果你們對他沒有任何指控的話
Unless you people have something to charge him with.

566
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,192
我們要走了
We're leaving.

567
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:54,122
回頭見  P姐姐
Syl   miss p.

568
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:56,582
順便說一下
By the way

569
00:28:58,162 --> 00:28:59,952
我確實懷念我媽媽
I do miss my mom.

570
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:06,462
她不是你的朋友
She's not your friend.

571
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,942
你是來套你話的
She was trying to trick you.

572
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:15,652
抱歉  長官  我盡力了
Sir   I'm sorry   I tried.

573
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:17,342
他願意求援就求援吧
If he invokes   he invokes.

574
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:19,492
你集中精力破解密碼吧
Concentrate on cracking the encryption.

575
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:20,652
好的
Yeah.

576
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:31,962
從頻繁程度上來看
Judging by sheer volume

577
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:34,112
Christophe的母親病情很嚴重
Christopher's mother was sick quite a bit.

578
00:29:34,112 --> 00:29:36,512
他父親多次送她去急診室
His father brought her into the er repeatedly.

579
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:39,942
她每次的情況都非常糟糕
She's described as being violently ill each time.

580
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,992
在重癥監護室幾天後就奇跡般的康復了
A couple of days in the icu   miraculous recovery

581
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:44,892
就是不停的反覆發生
Only to be repeated time and again.

582
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:46,982
沒有診斷意見  沒有確切的誘因
No diagnosis   no discernable cause.

583
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:48,562
有一個視頻正在上傳
There's another video going up.

584
00:29:48,562 --> 00:29:50,502
這是半小時內的第四個孩子
That's 4 kids playing in half an hour.

585
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:51,912
有幾個孩子在那所學校上學
How many kids go to this school?

586
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:53,962
整個縣都是它的學區 近2000人
Its catchment is the whole county. It's almost 2  000.

587
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:54,792
Garcia  我們急需
Garcia   we really need to

588
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,402
得到這個網站的管理權限
gain administrative access to the website.

589
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:57,692
我會寫下一些Christopher
I've written down a number of things

590
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,292
可能作為密碼的東西
Christopher may have used as the password.

591
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,812
我已經排除了生日和節日
I've already eliminated birthdays   holidays

592
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,522
寵物名  和流行文化名城
Pet names   and pop culture icons.

593
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:05,442
不  一些可憐的事情發生在他身上
No   there was something pathetic about him

594
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:06,812
而非犯罪
Not criminal.

595
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:09,762
當他離開的時候  他說他懷念他的母親
When he was leaving   he said he misses his mom.

596
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,372
他母親叫什麼名字
What's his mother's name?

597
00:30:12,372 --> 00:30:13,722
Cynthia Summers
Cynthia Summers.

598
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:15,362
就是它
That's it.

599
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:16,272
好的  用管理員權限登錄
All right   log in as administrator

600
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,232
切斷主要資源
and shut down the main resource

601
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,362
在做了
Already on it   my friend.

602
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,432
孩子們還在通過獨立的服務器上傳
Kids are still posting videos through independent servers.

603
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:23,762
把網站歷史記錄調出來
Pull up the website history.

604
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:25,842
看看能不能獲得些以往內容發佈的記錄
See if you can learn anything from historical posts.

605
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:30,822
Christopher的急診病志顯示
Christopher's er eval shows his bruises

606
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:34,642
他的瘀傷來自於長期的手掐和捆綁
Were caused by manual and ligature strangulation over time.

607
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:36,782
看這個  他還有
Take a look at this. He's also shown

608
00:30:36,782 --> 00:30:39,712
胸部的陳舊性瘀傷
To have layered bruising on his sternum.

609
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,622
看起來像個急救心臟起搏器
It looks like a cpr artifact.

610
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,702
但是這堥S有急救記錄
But there's no record of resuscitations.

611
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:46,892
等等  所有這些信息傳輸
Wait   all these transmissions

612
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:48,302
都源於同一個管理員嗎
Are transcripts of the same administrator?

613
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:49,452
是的  這堨u有一個源頭
Yeah   there's only one handle.

614
00:30:49,452 --> 00:30:51,112
那就怪了  他的語氣在文章埵傅雂
This is weird. In the posts his voice changes.

615
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:53,252
他每次都引用更多的文章  更加滴水不漏
At times he's using more articles   more precise verbiage

616
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,782
就像一直防備著我們
Like he's trying to throw us off.

617
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:56,492
對於一個孩子來說這太狡猾了
That's pretty sophisticated behavior for a kid.

618
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:57,812
一個作者可以偽裝他的寫作風格
A writer can disguise his own writing style

619
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:00,642
讓人感覺他更年輕或者教育程度更低
To make himself appear younger or less educated.

620
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:01,912
是啊  但是反過來
Yeah   but it's virtually impossible

621
00:31:01,912 --> 00:31:03,412
想讓你的風格變得更成熟或者
To pull off making yourself appear older

622
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:04,932
受教育程度更高就不太可能了
And more educated than you actually are.

623
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:06,642
事實上這埵釣潃茪ㄕP的寫作風格
There are actually 2 distinct writing style.

624
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:08,402
兩個作者用同一個網名
2 writers using the same screen name--

625
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:09,902
一個少年和一個成人
One teen and one adult.

626
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,602
Christopher被一個成年人操控著
Christopher was being manipulated by an adult.

627
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:12,812
她母親的死是一個典型的
The mother's death is a textbook case

628
00:31:12,812 --> 00:31:15,352
孟喬森代理綜合癥  被毒死的
Of munchausen by proxy. Surreptitious poisoning.

629
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,282
這個孩子被窒息然後搶救回來很多次
The kid has been choked and revived on multiple occasions.

630
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:20,362
你說過他父親在消防隊工作  對吧
You said the father worked for the fire department   right?

631
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:21,512
是的  有幾個月的時間了
Yeah   for a couple of months now.

632
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,622
--哪個部門  --急救組
In what capacity? As an EMT.

633
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,572
急救組  他就是我們的嫌犯
EMT. That's our unsub.

634
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,342
Christopher不清楚
Christopher didn't even understand

635
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:32,852
他電腦堛熔M除系統
The wiping systems on his computer.

636
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:34,722
是他父親假裝成同學在網上發帖
So the father poses as a classmate

637
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:36,622
邀請這些當地的孩子參加遊戲
And invites local kids to join the game.

638
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:37,972
增加賭注並且鼓勵他們
Bumps up the stakes and encourages them

639
00:31:37,972 --> 00:31:39,262
使用最危險的方式
To use their riskiest methods.

640
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:40,412
他在週五執勤
He works on Friday nights.

641
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,042
也就是說他能接到這些孩子的急救任務
Which means he gets called out to do the rescues.

642
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,392
他不僅僅是收集視頻
He's not just collecting video tapes.

643
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:45,002
他的孟喬森綜合癥在升級
His munchausen has evolved.

644
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,782
我去給他的車發個通緝令
I'll put out an apb for his truck.

645
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:48,332
他會找一個地方來下載這些視頻
He'll find a place to download the video tapes.

646
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:49,372
那相當於他的戰利品
They're his trophies.

647
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:51,672
之後  他會清理掉所有人證物證
After that   he'll clean up his mess.

648
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:53,832
Christopher是唯一對他有威脅的目擊證人
Christopher's the only witness against him.

649
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,036
安全
Clear.

650
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:36,536
安全
Clear!

651
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,036
過來看看
You need to see this.

652
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:43,936
這有很多光盤
There's dozens of discs here.

653
00:32:43,936 --> 00:32:44,826
當時我就在這房間
I was right here.

654
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:45,906
可我甚至都沒有看看周圍
I never even looked around.

655
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:48,336
我們只得到搜查手提電腦的許可
Well   we only had consent for the laptop

656
00:32:48,336 --> 00:32:49,666
而且他知道電腦加密過了
and he knew it was encrypted.

657
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,806
我們當時沒有合法原因來申請搜查許可
We didn't have probable cause for a warrant.

658
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:54,246
Summers先生沒有機會回來拿他的這些戰利品
Mr. Summers didn't have a chance to come back and get his trophies.

659
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:56,406
今晚他絕對會從網上下載那些視頻
He'll definitely try to download the videos tonight.

660
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:58,226
那個孩子用盡手段  就為了能夠活下去
This kid was doing everything he could just to survive.

661
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,016
過度的虐待導致他條件反射地包庇他父親
The extreme abuse conditioned him to shield his father.

662
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:02,146
當他爸爸走進來的時候
When his father came in the room

663
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,716
他看上去徹底放鬆了
he seemed genuinely relieved.

664
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,136
他卸下了負擔
His burden had been lifted.

665
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,586
他爸爸救他的時候他簡直興高采烈
He was elated when his father rescued him.

666
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,106
我們要重新思考每個細節了
We need to rethink everything.

667
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:11,896
我們要去哪
Where are we going?

668
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:18,256
去見你媽媽
To see your mom.

669
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:24,686
把注意力集中到他的態度舉止上
Now   let's focus on the behavior.

670
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:25,496
他屬於什麼行為模式
What's the pattern?

671
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,496
事情發展到一觸即發  父親就會離開
Things boil over   the father moves on.

672
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:30,506
新的城鎮  新的虐待方式
New town   new sadistic M.O.

673
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:33,146
Christopher知道他爸爸的行為模式
Christopher knows his father's pattern.

674
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:35,246
這樣我們才能找出真相
So that we can uncover the truth.

675
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:38,206
當然了
Sure you will.

676
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:40,886
真相
Truth.

677
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:44,136
在他看來  這件事將永無止境
In his mind   it will never end.

678
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:45,946
除非Christopher已經決定親手結束一切
Unless Christopher's decided to end it.

679
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:51,236
-Garcia  -是的  長官
- Garcia? - Yes   sir?

680
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:52,556
你和Christopher談話的時候
When you were talking to Christopher

681
00:33:52,556 --> 00:33:55,426
他有沒有說過一些話  暗示他要放棄了
Did he say anything to you to suggest that he was giving up?

682
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,346
放棄
Giving up?

683
00:33:56,346 --> 00:33:57,876
他有沒有試著道別
Was he trying to say good-bye?

684
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,236
我不懂
I don't understand.

685
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:00,786
他給你什麼東西了嗎
Did he give you anything?

686
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:02,016
是啊  你怎麼知道的
Yeah. How did you know that?

687
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:03,026
他給你什麼了
What did he give you?

688
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,046
我們說話的時候
When--when we were talking

689
00:34:04,046 --> 00:34:05,896
他給了我這個海盜耳環
he gave me this pirate's earring.

690
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:07,456
他已經打定主意了  自殺
He's made up his mind. Suicide--

691
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:09,276
是戰勝他虐待狂父親的唯一方法
the only victory over his sadistic father.

692
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:11,716
他也許還把自殺當作是和他母親的重逢
He may also see it as reuniting with his mother.

693
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,036
父親會從網上下載
The father's going to want to download

694
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:14,036
那些視頻  Garcia
those videos from somewhere   Garcia

695
00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:15,326
我們要阻止他
And we got to stop that process.

696
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:16,036
我已經在處理了
I'm already on that.

697
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:17,656
我把那個網址替換成了釣魚網站[仿冒網]
I replaced the website with a phishing site

698
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,316
我正在給那個服務器加載釣魚網
I'm downloading it to the servers now.

699
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:21,666
等他在網站登陸的時候
When he logs onto that website

700
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,386
他會轉而進入到我們的服務器
He's going to be rerouted to our server

701
00:34:23,386 --> 00:34:24,676
我們就可以追蹤到他的信息
and we can capture his information.

702
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:25,966
密切注意那個網站  Garcia
Stay on that site   Garcia.

703
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:27,016
好
Yeah.

704
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:31,336
我們走  來吧
Let's go. Come on.

705
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,146
這可以為我們爭取一些時間
It will buy us some time.

706
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:38,796
他們的目的地是哪
等等  那個母親呢
Where are they headed?
Wait. What about the mother?

707
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:39,696
一切都是因她而起
It's all about the mother.

708
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:41,786
Garcia  Cynthia Summers埋在哪堣F
Garcia   where is Cynthia Summers buried?

709
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:42,876
等等
Give me a second.

710
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:43,716
對於Christopher
You know   for Christopher

711
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:45,156
墓地是慰藉之地
a cemetery would be a place of refuge

712
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:46,096
可對於他爸爸來說
But for the father...

713
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:48,166
他再次回到了屍體處理地點
he's revisiting a body disposal site.

714
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,926
Oaklawn墓地  位於這堜MGlenrock之間
Oaklawn cemetery   halfway between here and Glenrock.

715
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,886
好  他一定很願意和他爸爸去那
Ok. He would willingly go there with his father.

716
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:54,776
不過他爸爸還是需要下載視頻
Well   the father still needs to download the videos.

717
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,186
而他需要電源
And he might need a power source.

718
00:34:56,186 --> 00:34:57,676
有一個小教堂  為葬禮準備的
There's a chapel. They use it for burials.

719
00:34:57,676 --> 00:34:59,756
出發  Garcia  我們會在車媮p繫你
Let's go. Garcia   we'll call you from the car.

720
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:08,626
你知道程序的  不會很久
You know the drill. This won't take long.

721
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:18,686
那是他的越野車
That's his suv.

722
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:20,426
說吧  Garcia
yeah   Garcia?

723
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:21,696
長官  Summers先生剛剛登陸了
Sir   Mr. Summers just logged on.

724
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:22,886
他被釣魚網站追蹤到了
He's caught in the phishing site.

725
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:24,116
他是不是在下載視頻
Is he downloading the videos?

726
00:35:24,116 --> 00:35:25,776
是的  不過他只能看到雪花而已
He's trying to   but all he's going to get is snow.

727
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,256
拜託
Oh   come on.

728
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:42,706
我不想死
I don't want to die.

729
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,386
你的死期由我決定
I decide when you die.

730
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,596
聯邦探員
FBI!

731
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:35,546
你們沒事吧
You guys good?

732
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:43,666
非常感謝
Well   I can't tell you

733
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,666
你們來幫忙
how much I appreciate y'all coming out here.

734
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:49,506
我只是慶幸結局不是太壞
I'm just glad it ended up ok.

735
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:50,806
拜託
Oh   come on.

736
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:54,166
小小城鎮堛漯v安官向聯邦探員求助
Small-time county sheriff calls the FBI

737
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,716
還是關於潛在性自殺案
about potential suicides

738
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:56,986
而你們卻放下手邊的工作
and you drop what you're doing

739
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:58,006
過來這
and you come here?

740
00:36:58,006 --> 00:36:59,916
我們會對任何級別的執法部門提供幫助
We're an asset for all levels of law enforcement.

741
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,196
這是我們的職責所在
It's what we do.

742
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:04,146
讓人欽佩
Well   it's incredible.

743
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:06,116
謝謝
Thank you.

744
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:08,596
你想和我們一起來嗎
Would you like to come with us?

745
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:11,726
我們要去通知家屬事情的真相
We're going to tell the parents what really happened.

746
00:37:12,306 --> 00:37:14,646
不了  我們要啟程回去了
Uh   no. We need to be getting back.

747
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:16,176
你確定嗎
You sure?

748
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:18,466
我知道這無法挽回什麼
I mean   I know it won't bring them back

749
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:22,796
不過  我想讓他們知道這不是蓄意自殺
but I would think that knowing that it wasn't intentional

750
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:24,516
多少會帶來些安慰吧
might bring some level of comfort.

751
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:26,866
一定會的
It will   definitely.

752
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:29,776
你去吧  祝你好運  治安官
You go ahead. Good luck   sheriff.

753
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:32,616
謝謝
Well   thank you.

754
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:46,376
這是什麼
What is that?

755
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,206
這個叫星之謎
It's called a star puzzle.

756
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:51,026
這個基本上無解的
It's basically impossible to figure out.

757
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:52,366
你要把所有碎片拼到一起
You have to put all of the

758
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:54,556
組成一個完整的星形
pieces back together to form a perfect star.

759
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:59,056
不過這個遊戲的來源  是一個愛情傳說
But the origin of it is   um   kind of a romantic tale.

760
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:02,686
有一個年輕的王子
There was this young prince

761
00:38:02,686 --> 00:38:04,646
他想捕獲王國堣@位
who wanted to win the heart

762
00:38:04,646 --> 00:38:06,976
傾國傾城的少女的芳心
of the fairest maiden in the land

763
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:08,786
所以他爬上了王國中
So he climbed to the top of

764
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,876
最高的塔頂
the tallest tower in the kingdom

765
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:13,436
然後他為她抓到了一顆流星
and he caught a falling star for her.

766
00:38:13,436 --> 00:38:15,806
不幸的是  他過於激動了  把流星掉到了地上
Unfortunately   he was so excited   he dropped it

767
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:18,216
於是那顆流星破碎成了這些碎片
and it smashed into all of these pieces

768
00:38:18,406 --> 00:38:21,526
所以他發瘋般地把這些碎片又拼湊到一起
so he frantically put it back together again

769
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:23,456
來證明他對她不朽的愛意
to prove his undying love to her

770
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:24,496
而且他成功了
and he succeeded

771
00:38:24,496 --> 00:38:26,456
最後他們幸福快樂地生活在了一起
and they lived happily ever after.

772
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,736
這一點都講不通啊
That doesn't make any sense.

773
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:30,856
什麼意思
What do you mean?

774
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:32,766
你不可能抓住流星的
You can't catch a falling star.

775
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:34,746
它在大氣層奡N燒成灰燼了
It would burn up in the atmosphere.

776
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:36,876
是  不過不是那個意思
Yeah   but it's not literal

777
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:38,236
Reid  那是個傳說
Reid. It's a fable.

778
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:39,406
可那並沒有什麼寓意啊
But there's no moral.

779
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:40,356
傳說都是有寓意的
Fables have morals.

780
00:38:40,356 --> 00:38:43,036
好吧  這只是個小小的愛情故事
Ok. So it's just a romantic little story.

781
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:45,526
而且主旨在於  做到這件事幾乎不可能
And the point is   it's basically impossible to do

782
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,276
因為你需要把這些碎片收集起來
because you have to take all of those pieces

783
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:49,216
然後重新組合到一起  要準確
and put them together exactly...

784
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:56,326
你真是讓人恨得牙癢癢  Reid博士
There's a lot to hate about you   Dr. Reid.

785
00:38:57,616 --> 00:38:59,396
試試跟他玩撲克牌
Play poker with him sometime.

786
00:38:59,856 --> 00:39:01,376
試試跟他下國際象棋
Try playing chess with him.

787
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,356
或者圍棋[有"離開"之意]
Or go.

788
00:39:08,286 --> 00:39:08,866
嘿
Hey.

789
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:10,116
嘿  喝咖啡嗎
Hey. Coffee?

790
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:11,156
多謝
Thanks.

791
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:12,756
我只是想謝謝你
I just wanted to say thank you.

792
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:15,056
要不是你要求進一步跟進的話
If you hadn't pushed it

793
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:15,956
我們不會來的
we would never have gone.

794
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,206
-Hotch  -JJ
- Hotch... - J.J.

795
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:26,846
你不用這樣的
You don't have to.

796
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:35,466
我11歲的時候
My sister gave this to me

797
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,526
我姐姐給了我這個
when I was 11.

798
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:41,706
有一天下午  她走進我的房間
She just came into my bedroom one afternoon

799
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:44,586
告訴我  不管發生什麼
and told me that no matter what happened

800
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:46,116
她是愛我的
She loved me.

801
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:50,906
這是她最心愛的項鏈
This was her favorite necklace

802
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:52,476
所以我告訴她我不能要
so I told her I couldn't take it

803
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:55,176
可她堅持給我
but she insisted.

804
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:59,356
當然了  我背地堥銋磭僆}心
I   of course   was secretly very happy

805
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,786
因為我一直想要一個和她一樣的項鏈
'cause I always wanted one just like hers.

806
00:40:07,126 --> 00:40:10,016
那是最後一次  我再也沒有
That's the last time-- I never...

807
00:40:10,956 --> 00:40:11,996
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

808
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:17,546
我每天都會想她
I think about her every day.

809
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:26,076
會好起來的  Hotch
It does get better   Hotch.

810
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:33,236
失去自己心愛的人  真的很心痛
Losing someone is... never easy.

811
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:37,866
可總有一天
But one day

812
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:40,696
當你想起她的時候  心不會再那麼痛
you'll remember her   and it won't hurt.

813
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:46,716
總有一天你會釋然的
You'll be happy.

814
00:40:47,786 --> 00:40:48,796
謝謝
Thank you.

815
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:51,296
謝謝你所做的一切
Thank you for everything.
