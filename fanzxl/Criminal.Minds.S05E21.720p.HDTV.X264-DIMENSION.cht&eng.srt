1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,020
今天幹得不錯 Brenda
Good job today,brenda.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,930
謝謝 Keith 今天收穫不錯
Thanks,keith. This was a great haul.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,530
是啊 今天魚可真願意咬鉤 很久沒這樣了
Yeah. They were really biting today. It's been a while.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,070
不如你先回去吧 我想把剩下的做成熏魚
Why don't you head back to town. I want to put the rest in the smoker.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,260
我載你一程吧
I'll drop you off.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,350
不用 我自己步行回去
No. I could do with the walk.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,680
快回家抱老婆吧
Get home to your wife.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,250
確定嗎? 我等你Lisa也不會介意的
You sure? Lisa wouldn't mind if I waited for you.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,380
我沒事的 回家吧
I'll be fine. Go home.

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,090
好吧 別太晚了 好嗎?
All right,well,don't stay too late,all right?

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,970
- 好的 明天見 - 好的 再見
- Ok. I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. See you.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,880
誰在那兒?
Is anyone there?

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,190
"誰在那兒" Brenda?
"is anyone there," brenda?

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,240
搞笑 即使真有殺人狂躲在暗處 他也不會回答
Right. 'cause the homicidal maniac hiding in the shadows is really going to answer you.

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,090
Keith?
Keith?

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,420
別惡搞了 這很沒趣
Stop messing around. It's not funny.

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,060
哦 是你
Oh,it's you.

18
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,000
我還以為是別人...
I thought someone was...

19
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,980
JJ 問題重點不在這
Jj,that's not the point.

20
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,910
你會給他打電話?
Well,are you gonna call him?

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,580
也許吧
Maybe.

22
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,750
Emily
Emily.

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,870
Mick Rawson是個傲慢 自負 性慾旺盛的...
Mick rawson is an arrogant,oversexed,egotistical...

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,510
而且聲音性感的火辣英國佬 有警徽 有佩槍
Hot british dude with a sexy accent,badge,and gun.

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,850
不正是你的菜嗎?
Just your type.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,470
你知道嗎? 有時我真的不瞭解你
You know what? I don't even get you sometimes.

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,580
不會有結果的
It wouldn't go anywhere.

28
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,260
不試怎麼知道
You don't know that.

29
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,210
我瞭解我們的工作
I know our work schedules.

30
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,990
知道嗎? Will和我不就協調得挺好
Ok,you know what? Will and I make it work.

31
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,380
不是吧
Oh,no.

32
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,660
我知道 明白 瞭解 別指責我
I know. I know. I know. Don't say it.

33
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,290
看看媕Y的東西再說... 這不是我的錯
But when you see what's in here... And it's not my fault.

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,790
我發誓是他們熱情招呼我 而且都是特價
They were calling to me,I swear. And they were all on sale.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,480
我想這樣有助於經濟恢復
And when you think about it,that means that I am helping the economy,

36
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,820
所以我做得比你們好 因為你們啥也沒買
which is more than I can say for you guys,'cause no one else has bags.

37
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,500
別說這些都是給我兒子買的
Yeah. Please tell me all of those aren't for my son.

38
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,870
- 不是 - 很好
- They're not. - Good.

39
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,950
只有這個是給Kevin的
This one is for kevin.

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,710
怎麼? 作為教母我理應寵愛我的教子
What? It is my duty as a fairy godmother to spoil the child.

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,170
Henry終有一天會長大 他打開禮物的時候會非常開心
And henry is finally old enough to be fun when opening presents.

42
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,690
我可不想去退啊
I'm not taking them back.

43
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,280
把我的咖啡給我 沒人會受傷
Give me my coffee and no one's gonna get hurt.

44
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,230
半咖啡因 加2份脫脂奶精攪勻的 特大杯焦糖瑪奇朵
Oh,uh,half-caf extra shot venti,2- pump nonfat,hold the whip caramel macchiato.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,020
下一站 "世外桃源"
Next stop,xanadu.

46
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,940
等等 "世外桃源"泡湯
Oh,wait. Xana-don't.

47
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,840
得回去開會了 女士們
Time to go to the bau,ladies.

48
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,880
也許我該養隻貓
Maybe I should get a cat.

49
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,460
- 很抱歉毀了你的浪漫之夜 - 怎麼 要努力迎娶第四任妻子嗎?
- Sorry to ruin your night. - What,are you working on wife number 4?

50
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,490
總是躲不開你們啊
I see you people way too much.

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,630
我們開始吧
Let's get started.

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,010
好的 安克雷奇分局請我們 協助調查阿拉斯加州富蘭克林的連環謀殺案
All right. Anchorage field office is asking us to investigate a series of murders in franklin,alaska.

53
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,480
過去不到一周內有三人遇害
There's 3 people dead in less than a week.

54
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,080
這對一個只有1476人的城市而言太顯著了
For a town with a population of 1,476,that's fairly significant.

55
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,010
這是他們第一次立案調查謀殺案
It's their first murder investigation on record.

56
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,510
誰是受害者?
Who are the victims?

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,470
Jon Baker 獵人
Uh,jon baker,a hunter.

58
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,470
Dedaimia Swanson 教師
Dedaimia swanson,a schoolteacher.

59
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,760
Brenda Bright 漁船大副
Brenda bright,the first mate on a fishing boat.

60
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,230
- 平均每2天有1個新的受害者 - 有關聯嗎?
- There's a new victim every 2 days. - Any connections?

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,890
顯然這種小城鎮大家都有關聯
Unfortunately,in a town this small,everyone's connected.

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,400
謀殺方式不同
Different kill methods.

63
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,210
報告稱前2個受害者都被步槍射殺
It says the first two victims were both shot with a rifle,

64
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,330
但Brenda Bright卻被箭刺兩次?
but brenda bright was stabbed twice with an arrow?

65
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,080
大家確信這是同一個人所為嗎?
Are we sure it's the same guy?

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,200
3名受害者均在交通繁忙區被發現
All 3 victims were found in heavily trafficked areas.

67
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,970
這表明不明嫌犯想讓他們終被發現
The unsub wants them found sooner than later.

68
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,560
Jon Baker的屍體暴露在外任由風吹雨打
Jon baker's body was left exposed to the elements,

69
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,590
但兩名女人卻被埋在垃圾堆下 為什麼?
but the two women were buried under mounds of trash. Why?

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,700
這可能是懊悔的表現
It could be a sign of remorse.

71
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,280
他掩蓋起屍體 就不用面對殺人的事實
Cover their bodies so he doesn't have to face the reality of what he's done.

72
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,350
或他認為這些女人都是垃圾 他按自己的想法處置他們
Or he thinks that the women are trash and he's just placed them where he thinks they belong.

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,990
還沒有任何定論
Well,we can't be sure of anything yet.

74
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,280
富蘭克林是一個獨立的漁業區 受經濟衰退影響很大
Franklin is an isolated fishing community that's been hit really hard by the current economy.

75
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,370
加上這些未破解的連環兇殺案 居民都瀕臨絕境
Add to that a series of unsolved murders and everyone's on edge.

76
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,870
當地的警長深覺力所不逮
The local sheriff's out of his depth.

77
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,030
阿拉斯加州上一次調查連環兇殺 還要追溯到80年代的Robert Hansen案
And alaska hasn't handled a serial investigation since robert hansen in the eighties.

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,140
今晚我們乘飛機前往 大家可以在飛機上休息
We'll fly out tonight. Everybody can sleep on the plane.

79
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,360
- Garcia 我需要你同行 - 長官?
- Garcia,I need you with us. - sir?

80
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,140
我已經申請了一條衛星線路 你的工作是確保我們的聯繫
I've tasked a satellite uplink and it's your job to keep us connected.

81
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,160
明白 長官
Yes,sir.

82
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,650
小鎮已經頻臨絕境 如殺手按此模式繼續
This town's already on the brink,and if this pattern continues,

83
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,340
我們僅有一天去阻止下次謀殺 趕緊動身
we've only got another day until the next murder. Let's finish this fast.

84
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:33,060

85
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,580
"自然 她最叫人目眩神迷的地方在於"
"nature in her most dazzling aspects "or stupendous parts,"

86
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,840
"她是人類悲劇孕育的溫床 上演的舞台" 約翰·莫利(19世紀法國啟蒙主義思想家)
is but the background and theater of the tragedy of man." John morley.

87
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,240
這傢伙展開了他的殺戮 沒有任何性別和種族界限
This guy's all over the map. Crosses sex and race boundaries.

88
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,810
他改變了殺人模式 這表明他很混亂
He changed his kill method. It says to me he's disorganized.

89
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,170
但所有的罪案現場都沒留下指紋 他還孤立了受害者
Yet there weren't prints at any of the crime scenes,and he isolated his victims.

90
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,150
戴手套 確保不被任何人看見 這點傻瓜都知道
Wearing gloves and making sure there aren't any witnesses... That's a no-brainer.

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,540
但讓我關注的是謀殺的"進化"
But what concerns me is the evolution of the kills.

92
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,020
"進化"?
Evolution?

93
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,810
開始時他選擇容易的獵物
Well,he started with easy prey.

94
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,630
Jon Baker 60多歲
Jon baker was in his mid sixties.

95
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,550
對於第一次下手而言風險較低
It's relatively low-risk for a first-timer.

96
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,620
Dedaimia Swanson 50歲出頭
Dedaimia swanson was in her early fifties.

97
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
她也不難被制服
She wouldn't be that difficult to overpower.

98
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,770
他無需制服他們 前兩個受害者都是被射殺的
But he didn't have to overpower either one of them. Both victims were shot.

99
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,770
這正是我要說的
Which is my point exactly.

100
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,830
他從遠處射殺了他們
He killed them both from a safe distance.

101
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,530
但Brenda Bright年輕 更健壯
But brenda bright was younger,more athletic.

102
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,520
她有能力跟殺手抵抗 所以為什麼不把她也射殺呢?
She would have been able to put up much more of a fight,so why not shoot her,too?

103
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,330
這表明他的行為模式紊亂
That supports the disorganized theory.

104
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,290
也許在前兩名受害者身上 他沒有獲得想要的東西
Maybe he didn't get what he wanted from his first two victims.

105
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,880
Brenda Bright是個吸引人的女人
Brenda bright was an attractive woman.

106
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,980
他用了箭 但並非用箭射殺 而是刺殺
He used an arrow,but he didn't shoot her with it. He stabbed her.

107
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,650
我想大家都明白刺殺的意味
I think we all know what that means.

108
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,400
我們在安克雷奇著陸後 轉乘一架水上飛機去富蘭克林
When we land in anchorage,there'll be a float plane to take us to franklin.

109
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
抵達後 Morgan和Prentiss負責現場
When we get there,morgan and prentiss work the crime scene.

110
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,700
我們要搞清殺手是怎麼伏擊受害者的
We need to know exactly how he ambushed his victims.

111
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,730
Reid和Rossi負責屍體 看能有什麼發現
Reid and rossi,the bodies. Find out what you can there.

112
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,330
JJ和我負責被害者研究 Garcia負責鎮上的記錄調查
Jj and I will work victimology. And,garcia,town records.

113
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,300
- 找出一切我們可用的資料 - 當然 長官
- Find us something we can use. - Of course,sir.

114
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,550
我想告知大家當地的信號非常不穩定
I should let everybody know that reception in the area is unreliable at best.

115
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,660
我會發給大家衛星電話用以通訊
I'm giving everybody satellite phones for communication,

116
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,480
我已在所有電話預設了快捷鍵
and I've already preprogrammed all your digits into speed dial.

117
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,890
猜猜誰是幸運的7號
Guess who's lucky number 7.

118
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,320
歡迎來富蘭克林 我是Flack警官
Welcome to franklin. I'm deputy flack.

119
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,340
這是Brenda Bright 被殺那晚工作的碼頭嗎?
Are these the docks that brenda bright was working the night she was killed?

120
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,830
- 是的 - 很好 我們從這媔}始調查
- yes. - All right,we'll get started here.

121
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,650
- Hotchner探員? - 是的
- Agent hotchner? - Yes,sir.

122
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,020
- Rhodes警長 - 很高興見到你
- Sheriff rhodes. - Very nice to meet you.

123
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,090
很高興見到你們
Good to meet you,sir,ma'am.

124
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,590
你們能來我真是太感激了
So I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you all could come.

125
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,540
居民們開始恐慌了
The people here are really starting to act up.

126
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,920
這個小鎮的氣氛一觸即發
I'm afraid our little town's a bit of a powder keg.

127
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,180
我們要安頓在哪
Where would you like us to set up,sir?

128
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,900
是這樣 警局堥S有足夠的地方 因為警局還兼做郵局
You see,there's not much room at the station because that's also the post office.

129
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,860
不過我跟Carol說好了 你們可以在她的旅館堣u作 就在這
But I have made arrangements for you to work out of carol's tavern,which is right over there.

130
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,490
- 謝謝 - 謝謝你們能來
- thank you. - Well,thank you. Appreciate it.

131
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,520
這奡X乎與世隔絕 你們的生活物資從哪來
It's pretty isolated out here. How do you get basic supplies?

132
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,340
水上飛機每周送一次食品和五金用品
Float planes bring grocery and hardware deliveries on a weekly basis,

133
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,680
漁夫和獵人為鎮上居民提供肉類
and fishermen and hunters provide the town's meat supply.

134
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,940
我是Craig Ramey 你們是FBI?
I'm craig ramey. You all the fbi?

135
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,570
你怎麼知道的?
What gave us away?

136
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,750
你要出海捕魚嗎? 帶了不少東西啊
You're sure packing an awful lot of stuff for a fishing trip.

137
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,870
我不是去捕魚的
I'm not going fishing.

138
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,640
在我和我妻子被殺之前 我們要趕快離開
Getting the hell out of dodge before it's me or my wife put in the ground.

139
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,580
你認識Brenda嗎?
Did you know brenda well?

140
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,720
大家都認識她 她很可愛
Everyone did. She was sweet.

141
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,790
她幹起活來 不比碼頭上任何一個男人差
She's pull a haul just as good as any guy on these docks.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,280
等我把房子封起來 我就馬上離開
As soon as I get my house boarded up,I'm heading out.

143
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,690
你最好也別待在這了 Susan 借過
Suggest you do the same,susan.

144
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,100
我也不能怪他
I can't say that I blame him.

145
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,520
出了這種事情 只走了這麼些人 已經不容易了
With what's been going on,i'm surprised more people aren't trying to leave.

146
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,420
這是Keith Graves Brenda遇害的晚上他們在一起
This is keith graves. He was with brenda the night she died.

147
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,950
Graves先生 兇案發生當晚有什麼異常嗎?
Mr. Graves,did you notice anything out of the ordinary the night of the murder?

148
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,890
沒有 我想要等她一起走的 可是她堅持要我先回鎮上
No. I offered to wait for her,but she insisted I head up to town without her.

149
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,260
那天晚上你們做了什麼
What were you two doing that night?

150
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,130
那天的工作結束我就走了
We finished for the day. I left.

151
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,200
她在那處理要帶回家的魚
She stuck around to clean the fish that she wanted to take home.

152
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,710
- 她一直都一個人回家嗎? - 是的
- She usually walk home alone? - Yeah.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,680
Brenda說走路可以昇華靈魂
Brenda said that walking was good for the soul.

154
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,020
這兒離鎮上有多遠
How far is it into town?

155
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,930
大約半英里
About a half a mile.

156
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,120
不明嫌犯可以在任何地方伏擊她
The unsub could have waited for her anywhere.

157
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,750
謝謝你的配合
Appreciate your time.

158
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,090
警長要我在你們來之前 把屍體放在冰上保存
Sheriff asked me to keep everyone on ice till you got here.

159
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,050
我還是很難相信 鎮上有人會做出這種事
Still,I can't believe someone from franklin would be capable of this.

160
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,030
你根據什麼判斷 她是被箭刺死的而不是被槍擊的?
What convinced you she was stabbed with the arrow instead of shot?

161
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,860
刺入點呈向上的角度
Upward angle at the point of entry.

162
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,010
若是射殺 他得在她下方
He would have had to been shooting from beneath her.

163
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,950
屍體已經被野獸吃的殘缺不全了
There wasn't much left. Forest got to him first.

164
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,880
- 我在屍體上發現了尿液 - 尿液?
- I found urine on the remains. - Urine?

165
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,520
我覺得可能是 啃食屍體的動物留下的
I thought it was from the animals who scavenged his body,

166
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,270
但是化驗結果今天早上出來了
but I got the lab results back this morning.

167
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,320
那是人類的尿液 他這是在給受害人做標記嗎
the urine was human. Is he marking his victims?

168
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,320
我只在Jon身上發現了尿液 兩具女性的屍體上都沒有
Only found it on jon. Both the women were clean.

169
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,830
Jon被射了三槍 前兩槍是擦傷 最後一槍正中頭部
Jon was shot 3 times. The unsub grazed him twice and then hit him in the head.

170
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,780
Dedaimia Swanson只被射了一槍
Dedaimia swanson was only shot once.

171
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,830
第一次殺人的時候 嫌犯還很猶豫 不確定
The first kill shows hesitation,uncertainty.

172
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,320
他沒有射出致命一槍的信心
He wasn't confident taking the terminal shot.

173
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,530
他最後開那一槍可能是偶然 或者是被那場景刺激到了
It was either accidental or spur of the moment,

174
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,150
但第二次殺人 他只用了一槍 他進步的很快
but the second kill,he only needed one shot. He's progressing quickly.

175
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,550
你和受害人熟悉嗎
Were you close with the victims?

176
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,090
我是鎮上唯一的醫生 他們都來我這就診
An occupational hazard when you're the only doctor in town.

177
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,920
Brenda還是我接生的 白髮人送黑髮人實在讓人難以接受
I delivered brenda. Never thought I'd outlive her.

178
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,950
看她軀幹上的傷口
Look at the cuts on her torso.

179
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,010
都很淺 而且沒有刺透
They're shallow and non-penetrating.

180
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,300
- 這些傷口不是為了殺她 - 這是死後才刺的
- Not necessary for the murder. - You know what? These were made postmortem.

181
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,620
他在用這些屍體實驗殺人方法
He's playing with the bodies,experimenting with his methodology.

182
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,780
這是個沒有憐憫之心的人
Someone incapable of remorse.

183
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,520
我們遇到是一個變態人格的殺人犯
We're dealing with a psychopath.

184
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,730
你檢查過她是否遭受過性侵犯嗎?
Have you determined whether or not she was raped?

185
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,900
我完全沒想過做這個檢查
I didn't even think to look.

186
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,800
你的報告中說 襲擊是在這發生的
Your report says the assault occurred here.

187
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,880
沒錯 從那個方向有一道血跡延伸過來
That's right. There was a trail of blood coming from that direction.

188
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,680
這堥S有血跡
I don't see any blood.

189
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,990
- 我們把它埋起來了 - 你們破壞了犯罪現場?
- We covered it up. - You contaminated the scene?

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,990
我們必須這麼做 樹林埵酗@隻狂暴的熊
We had to. We've got a rabid bear in the woods.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,150
它會把小獵物撕成碎片
It's been ripping smaller game to shreds.

192
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,180
那種動物聞到血腥味 就會毫不猶豫地衝進鎮子
A creature like that smells blood,he'll come into town,no hesitation.

193
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,870
好吧 你說另兩名受害者 被發現的情形和這差不多?
Ok,you said the other two victims were found similar to this?

194
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,450
Jon是在森林邊上被發現的
Jon was found on the edge of the woods.

195
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,940
Dedaimia在上面的瀑布邊被發現
Dedaimia was up by crest falls.

196
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,720
那是很受歡迎的遠足路線
It's a popular hiking route.

197
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,260
- 都有誰知道他們的作息規律? - 大家都知道
- Who would know their routines? - Everyone.

198
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,360
Jace 要喝咖啡嗎?
Cup of coffee,jace?

199
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,030
你在幹什麼?
What are you doing?

200
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,680
讓這地方變得不那麼模擬化
Trying to make this place a little less analog.

201
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,340
抱歉 我知道我的黑客笑話很冷
Sorry. I forget my hacker jokes aren't funny.

202
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,680
我叫Penelope
My name is penelope.

203
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,740
我不帶槍 我的武器就是我的聰明才智
I'm the one who doesn't carry a weapon,aside from my biting wit.

204
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,290
我的工作就是 把我強大的系統 和你們警署的數據結合起來
And my job includes combining my kick-ass systems with your sheriff's department database

205
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,820
然後來調查你們的秘密
to get the skinny on your neighbors and you.

206
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,300
你想知道什麼 可以直接問我們啊
Or you could just ask us what you want to know.

207
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,890
我是說 直截了當的對話 不比窺探隱私要好嗎
I mean,isn't it better to just talk to us directly than look up our dirt secretly?

208
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,860
我不覺得 因為根據我的經驗 網絡信息是可靠的 而人們總會說謊
No. Because in my experience,the information superhighway never lies and people do.

209
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,060
- 你的名字是什麼 - Josh
- Your name would be? - Josh.

210
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,580
我媽媽Carol是這的老闆
My mom carol,she owns the place.

211
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,230
給你看看 有了
It goes like this. Here we are.

212
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,900
Joshua Beardsley 23歲 出生於阿拉斯加 富蘭克林
Joshua beardsley,age 23,born right here in franklin,ak.

213
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,610
初中和高中搬到安克雷奇
Moved to anchorage for middle and high school.

214
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,650
在西雅圖大學主修酒店管理
Majored in hotel management at seattle u.

215
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,850
你幾周前搬回來
And you moved back home a few weeks ago.

216
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,830
時機絕佳啊 一回來 就有人陸續被殺
Perfect timing,huh? I come home,people start dying.

217
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,100
我來看看你的犯罪記錄
That's when I check your criminal record.

218
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,910
我的朋友 你身家清白
And you,my friend,are clean as a whistle.

219
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,200
- 什麼意思? - 不知道
- What does that even mean? - No idea.

220
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,920
不是開玩笑 所以我現在安全了?
No dirt,anyway,so,I guess I'm safe,then?

221
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,830
目前為止
For now.

222
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,040
這兩個昨晚進來的
Those two got into it last night.

223
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,420
這是Bob 他是新來的
Bob here,he's our newest resident,

224
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,210
所以Tom認為所有謀殺 都是他一人幹的
so,uh,tom figures,well,this is the guy who's doing all the killings.

225
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,080
於是決定用酒瓶砸爛他腦袋
He decides to smash him over the head with a bottle of booze.

226
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,830
聽著 我不知道怎麼辦
Look,I don't know what to do.

227
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,330
你有沒有想過開個大會
Have you thought about having a kind of town hall meeting

228
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,150
把大家聚在一起 討論這個案子?
where you get everybody together and talk about the facts of the case?

229
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,310
這個鎮子太鬆散了
The town's too spread out.

230
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,410
每個人只是得過且過
I mean,everybody's doing what they can just to get by,you know?

231
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,870
警長 我知道 人們搬到這些邊遠地區 就是求清靜
Sheriff,I know people move to these remote locations to be left alone,

232
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,400
但昨晚發生的事 不會就此停止
but what happened last night is gonna keep happening,

233
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,920
慢慢下去 每個人都清靜不了了
and people are going to start taking matters into their own hands.

234
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,980
我可以管好自己這個鎮 但周圍的人 這兒可是阿拉斯加
Well,I can keep order in my own town,but people around here,I mean,this is alaska,man.

235
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,820
他們為所欲為
They do what they want.

236
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,880
他已經在受害者身上進行了實驗
He's already experimenting with his victims.

237
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,950
他用箭對Brenda Bright施暴
He violated brenda bright with an arrow.

238
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,260
不斷激起居民恐慌
And he's inciting panic.

239
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,610
在這埵矰F大半輩子的人 都打包準備離開
People who have lived here most of their lives are packing up to leave.

240
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,790
這能怪他們嗎?
Can you blame them?

241
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,790
這埵陪蚥傴A狂 作案範圍就是這1400人的小鎮
We have a psychopath whose hunting ground is a town of 1,400 people.

242
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,980
大多數居民 從小學習狩獵和生火
Most of them grew up learning to kill animals and start fires.

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,330
聽上去像基本生存技能
It sounds like your basic survival skills.

244
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,920
不 是狩獵技能
No. They're hunting skills.

245
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,740
想想看 那種槍法 那些尿液 是有意義的
Think about it. The marksmanship,the urine... It makes sense.

246
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,380
尿液也有意義?
The urine makes sense?

247
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,320
這是獵人的計謀 順風尿尿 以趨散動物
It's a hunter's trick. You urinate downwind to keep the animals away.

248
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,140
他想方設法保存Jon Baker的屍體 好讓它原封不動的被發現
He tried to preserve jon baker's body so it would be discovered intact.

249
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,260
這下好了 變態狂具備狩獵技巧 還瞭解鎮上人們的作息時間
All right,so we've got a psychopath with hunting skills who knows the routines of everyone in town.

250
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,760
我們如何保障大家的安全?
How are we supposed to keep everyone safe?

251
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,870
警長 我建議你制定宵禁 直到我們抓獲不明嫌犯
Sheriff,I suggest you institute a curfew until we have the unsub in custody.

252
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,980
天黑後不得外出
Nobody out after dark.

253
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,760
我會保證有警官日夜巡邏
I'll have one of my deputies patrolling around the clock.

254
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,350
Garcia 鎮上的記錄如何?
Garcia,how's it coming with town records?

255
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,640
我查遍了CODIS系統 沒有發現有價值的信息
I've run everyone who's been printed through codis. Nothing's come up so far.

256
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,690
今晚熬夜核對完所有記錄
I'm gonna pull an all-nighter,finish going through the town records.

257
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,900
- 明早應該能有背景資料了 - 好
- Should have background checks by sunrise. - Good.

258
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,360
剩下的人抓緊睡一會兒 明早有個好精神
The rest of us should get some sleep,start fresh in the morning.

259
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,060
樓上有四個空房間
I've got 4 of the upstairs rooms available.

260
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,790
- 4個? - 別這樣 我們就這個條件
- Uh,4? - come on,that's the best we can do.

261
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,580
你們團隊人數是我部門的兩倍
Your team is double the size of my department.

262
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,680
- 明早見 - 晚安
- I'll see you in the morning. - good night.

263
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,770
- 得兩人一間了 - 我不跟Reid睡
- It looks like we'll have to double up. - I'm not sleeping with reid.

264
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,880
我跟你了
Dibs.

265
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,460
什麼意思 你要跟Morgan一個房間?
What do you mean,you're sharing a room with morgan?

266
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,280
你吃醋了
Oh,you're jealous.

267
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,620
吃醋? 因為什麼? ... 因為跟你共眠的人是...
Jealous? Why? Because you're bedding down with a...

268
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,850
當代肌肉版007?
Muscle-bound,modern-day 007?

269
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,080
他更像伯恩
Mm,he's more like jason bourne.

270
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,460
還問我有什麼好吃醋的?
Oh,what's there to be jealous about?

271
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,250
他睡地板
He took the floor.

272
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,850
確保他把槍裝在皮套 好嗎?
Ok. Just... Just make sure he keeps his weapon holstered,ok?

273
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,760
你怎麼還沒睡? 已經很晚了
Why are you up right now,anyway? It's so late.

274
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,520
還很早 我剛到匡提科
Actually,it's early. I just got to quantico.

275
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,720
可惡的時差
Damn time zones.

276
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,410
喂?
- Hello? - Hello?

277
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,980
喂?
Hello?

278
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,910
<i>信號中斷 衛星傳輸受到干擾 超出轄區範圍 無法連接</i>

279
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,210
見鬼了
Frak.

280
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,790
別這樣
Oh,come on,baby.

281
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,000
加油 加油 加油
Come on,come on,come on.

282
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,280
幹得好 Garcie
Nice one,garcie.

283
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,800
看著我 你會沒事的
Look at me. You're gonna be ok.

284
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,490
我叫Penelope 你會沒事的
My name's penelope. You're gonna be ok. You're gonna be ok.

285
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,160
一直看著我
Just keep looking at me.

286
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,350
救命! 救命!
Help! Help! Please!

287
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,380
快來人!
Somebody come help here!

288
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,620
有人受傷了! 救命!
Someone is hurt! Please!

289
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,420
他叫Craig Ramey 是個漁民
His name's craig ramey. Fisherman.

290
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,910
我跟Morgan今早遇見他
Morgan and I met him this morning.

291
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,110
他正收拾準備離開
He was packing up to leave.

292
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,100
他提前了作案時間
He's accelerating his schedule.

293
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,860
我們應該還有一天 為什麼改變?
We should have had another day. Why change that?

294
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,030
對於離開鎮子一事 Ramey頗為高調
Ramey was pretty vocal about wanting to get out of town.

295
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,720
如果不明嫌犯知道了 便會提前下手 阻止目標逃走
If the unsub knew that,he could have struck early to prevent his target from getting away.

296
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,520
應該不僅僅只這樣
There has to be more to it than that.

297
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,150
他把屍體帶到我們所在的酒館
He brought the body to the tavern we're staying at.

298
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,890
他要告訴我們 他不怕我們 他越來越自信了
He's telling us that he's not afraid of us. He's gaining confidence.

299
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,640
他改用獵刀 像是鋸齒刃的
He switched to a hunting knife. Looks like a jagged edge.

300
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,480
還有一些損傷 像是人被割開了
There's more physical damage,too,like he was cut open.

301
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,530
要等Johnson醫生做屍檢之後才知道
I won't know until dr.Johnson does an autopsy,

302
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,690
但我打賭他割走了 受害者的一塊肉
but I'd be willing to bet he took a piece of the victim with him.

303
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,560
哪堛漱@塊?
What kind of piece?

304
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,380
很難說 但從位置上看 我猜是肝臟或者脾臟
It's hard to say,but judging from the location,I would guess liver or spleen.

305
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,370
他當時還活著
He was alive.

306
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,130
什麼?
What?

307
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,360
他當時依然活著
He was still alive.

308
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,770
親愛的 你無能為力
Baby,there's nothing else you could have done.

309
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,340
我感受到他的逝去
I felt him leave.

310
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,130
前一秒他還在的... 後一秒就沒了知覺
He was there one second,and then... Just a body.

311
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,740
我很難過你看到這些
I'm really sorry that you had to see all of that.

312
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,390
Derek 我...我不只是看到 而是參與其中
Derek,I...I didn't see,I was in it.

313
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,300
我習慣了每天安全地在屏幕上 看可怕的事物 但這個是...
I was sort of used to seeing horrible things from the safety of my screens every day,but this was...

314
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,130
親眼所見
Right there.

315
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,140
為什麼不直接跑開去找人幫忙?
Why didn't you go and find someone before you ran out there?

316
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,710
我記得自己中槍時 心媟Q著 這輩子記得的最後一樣東西
Because when I got shot,I remember thinking the last thing I'm ever gonna see in this life

317
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,070
就是兇手的臉 我不希望在他身上重演
is the man who killed me, and I couldn't let that happen to him.

318
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,510
他死之前應該 看到些美好的東西
He had to see something good before he died.

319
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,500
你直接跑向不明嫌犯 你可能被殺
You ran right towards the unsub. You could have been killed.

320
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,920
我知道 別說的好像我是受害者
I know that. Don't treat me like I'm the victim.

321
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,740
好吧 對不起
All right. I'm sorry.

322
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,030
我想問你幾個問題行嗎?
I want to ask you a couple of questions,all right?

323
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,730
不 我... 我所有看見的都說了
No. I... I told you everything I saw.

324
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,910
你是在黑暗中看到那個男人的臉 又有許多血跡
You said the man's face was mostly in shadow,but there was also a lot of blood on it.

325
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,510
你看到的 可能比你意識到的更多
You might have seen more than you actually realize.

326
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,790
不 這些認知談話 用科學和統計來分析人的死...
No. Cognitive interviews,breaking someone's death down to a science and statistic...

327
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,250
- 那是你的工作 Derek 不是我的! - Penelope!
- That is your world,derek,not mine! - Penelope!

328
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,480
- 我會以我的方式提供幫助 - Penelope!
- I will help from mine. - Penelope!

329
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,340
Derek 隨她去吧
Derek,let her go.

330
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,440
你照看好她 行嗎?
Will you look after her,please?

331
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,630
沒問題
Yeah,of course.

332
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,500
Garcia給你新信息了嗎?
Was garcia able to give you any new information?

333
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,880
- 她盡她所能了 - 這個傢伙在戲弄我們 總是比我們早一步
- She's given all she can. - This guy's taunting us. He's one step ahead.

334
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,030
我想你高看他了
I think you're giving him more credit than he deserves.

335
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,260
正如Emily在飛機上說的 他沒有特定目標
It's like emily said on the plane,he's all over the place.

336
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,470
受害者類型前後不一致 方法在不斷"改進"
The victimology's inconsistent,the methodology's evolving,

337
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,040
第一起謀殺是草率的 遲疑的 未經計劃的
the first kill was sloppy,hesitant,and unplanned.

338
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,180
那是個意外 但卻引發了生理反應 他在這事情上得到了釋放
It was an accident,but it triggered a sexual response. He got off on it.

339
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,020
清楚了這一點 殺戮就停不下來了
And he knew then and there he had to kill again.

340
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,790
他學會了如何更有效率
He learned how to get the job done more efficiently.

341
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,150
沒錯 但割下器官是為什麼呢?
Yeah,but why the organs?

342
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,940
取走部分屍體 非常典型地表明 他把被害者留在身邊的渴望
Consumption typically indicates a desire to keep the victim with them.

343
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,160
他無法放手 我們要找的人 很可能有嚴重的被遺棄問題
He's having trouble letting go. We're probably looking for someone with severe abandonment issues.

344
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,320
很快就天亮了 把所有人集中起來 梳理下已知的情況
It'll be light soon. Let's get everybody together and go over what we know.

345
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,570
我們要找的 是一個感情上很不成熟的男性
we're looking for an emotionally immature male,

346
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,220
很可能在25-30歲之間 曾遭受過創傷性的損失
probably in his mid to late twenties,who suffered a traumatic loss.

347
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,900
可能是任何方面的損失
Now,this loss could be anything.

348
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,830
父母亡故 與配偶分居 所愛的人遷居他處
Death of a parent,separation of a spouse,a loved one who moved away.

349
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,350
某種 讓不明疑犯覺得 被拋棄了 覺得孤獨的事
Something that made the unsub feel abandoned and alone.

350
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,970
他有豐富的狩獵經驗
He'll have extensive hunting experience.

351
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,400
埋屍 不是因為後悔
The bodies were buried not because of remorse,

352
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,380
是為防止被野生動物破壞
they were buried to protect them from wild animals.

353
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,800
他對被害人的日程之熟悉 顯示出 不明疑犯這輩子大部分時間都住這
His familiarity with the victims' routines suggests the unsub has lived here for most of his life.

354
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,000
他對環境與地形瞭如指掌
He also has extensive knowledge of the landscape and surroundings.

355
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,610
所以 我們分頭行動覆蓋全鎮
So we should split up and cover the town.

356
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,940
重點查有輕微犯罪以及 襲擊記錄的青年居民
Focus on younger residents with a history of petty crimes and assaults.

357
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,780
你們應該檢查它們的 垃圾 壁爐 甚至是髒衣服
You should look in their trash,fireplaces,even in laundry.

358
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,080
尋找血衣 割傷 以及淤青的跡象
Look for signs of bloody clothes or even cuts and bruises.

359
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,910
可能有被害者在死前 結結實實地給他來了一兩下子
One of the victims may have gotten in a good blow or two before they died.

360
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,450
看起來有事瞞著的人 就帶回來
bring in anyone who seems to have something to hide.

361
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,180
不明疑犯已經打破了作案模式 他隨時都有可能再次作案
The unsub has already broken patterns,so he could strike again at any time.

362
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,350
警長 你和我去學校看看 跟老師聊聊
Sheriff,you and I need to look at the school,talk to the teacher,

363
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,150
看她是否記得有什麼學生 表現出殺人傾向的早期跡象
see if she remembers any students exhibiting early signs of homicidal tendencies.

364
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
我們行動吧
Let's move.

365
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,130
Dedaimia還差一個月就退休了
Dedaimia was only one month away from retirement.

366
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,050
我真不敢相信 她去世了
I can't believe she's gone.

367
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,760
我們深感遺憾
We're very sorry for your loss.

368
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,880
我們得問問你以前學生的情況
I need to ask about your former students.

369
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,630
您記得有誰 過分熱衷打獵 過分到讓您擔心的地步嗎?
Do you remember any of them enjoying hunting too much,so much that it worried you?

370
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,230
這堜狾釭漕k孩子都喜歡得不得了
All the boys around here like it too much.

371
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,560
他們還比賽看誰槍法更准呢
They have competitions to see who's the better shot.

372
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,210
這個人應該是到了偏激的程度
This would have been extreme.

373
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,830
有沒有人 在殺死動物之前 會折磨它們或者跟它們玩嗎?
Do you remember anyone who might have tortured animals or played with them before he killed them?

374
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,370
想起什麼人來了嗎?
Does that sound like someone you know?

375
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,890
我從沒見過有人 像Joshua Beardsley那樣熱衷狩獵
I've never seen anyone enjoy hunting as much as joshua beardsley.

376
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,470
- 他是酒館老闆的兒子? - 沒錯
- He's the tavern owner's son? - Yeah.

377
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,500
全鎮最年輕的獵到鹿的男孩子
The youngest boy in town to bag a deer.

378
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,290
他從來就只談這些
That's all he ever talked about.

379
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,220
他幾乎每天都獵點什麼
He hunted something nearly every day.

380
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,080
他土生土長
He was born and raised here.

381
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,320
父親過世後 他回來了 就在幾周前
He returned a couple of weeks ago after his dad died.

382
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,540
他多大了?
How old is he?

383
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,050
- 23? - 沒錯
- 23? - Sure.

384
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,840
- 我們得去跟他談談 - 好吧
- We need to talk to him. - All right.

385
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,000
謝謝你
Thank you.

386
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,180
這是為啥事?
What's this about?

387
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,530
並未傷及內臟
The strike was above the gut.

388
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,750
這會使肉不至於腐壞 對吧?
It keeps the meat from spoiling. Isn't that right?

389
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,540
對鹿來說 也許吧
On a deer,maybe.

390
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,480
對人來說 估計就不一定了
Doubt it'd be the same for a human.

391
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,280
但接著他做了件有意思的事情
But then he did something interesting.

392
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,960
他取走了被害人的脾臟
He took the victim's spleen.

393
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,280
告訴我 他為什麼要這麼做?
Now,tell me,why would he do that?

394
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,620
不知道
No idea.

395
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,320
我們就別耍花樣了Joshua
Let's stop playing games,joshua.

396
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,560
回答我的問題 或許我會相信你的
Answer my questions and maybe I'll believe you.

397
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,830
這是本地的狩獵傳統 不是嗎?
It's a native hunting tradition,isn't it?

398
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,110
吃下殺掉的生靈的一部分
Eat part of the kill.

399
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,080
獲取你的獵物的生命力
Gain the life force of your prey.

400
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,800
知道這個的人可不多
Not many people know that.

401
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,110
可我知道
I'm not many people.

402
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,800
你在哪學會的狩獵?
Where did you learn to hunt?

403
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,920
7歲的時候就獵獲了我的第一隻鹿
Bagged my first deer when I was 7.

404
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,220
那是挺早的
That's pretty young.

405
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,510
我父親教會我如何靠大地為生
My dad taught me how to live off the land.

406
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,120
我吃掉了我第一隻獵物的心臟
I ate the heart of my first kill.

407
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,210
這證明你是個真正的獵人
That proves you're a true hunter.

408
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,520
這麼說 你...折衷狩獵?
So,you,um,enjoy hunting?

409
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,230
這是我最愛做的事情
It's my favorite thing to do.

410
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,780
那 你在殺戮中獲得快樂嗎?
Then would you say you take pleasure in the kill?

411
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,840
大家不都是嗎?
Doesn't everyone?

412
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,500
實際上 不 不是的
Actually,no...They don't.

413
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,340
- 你怎麼看? - 我不確定
- What do you think? - I'm not sure.

414
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,050
他符合側寫 但他表現得十分坦蕩
He fits the profile,but he's acting like a man with nothing to hide.

415
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,520
襲擊週期在縮短 他今晚要作案
The attack cycle's accelerating. He should strike tonight.

416
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,190
要是沒有出手 那我們就已經抓對人了
And if he doesn't,we know we've got our guy in custody.

417
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,650
要是他今晚下手呢?
And what if he does?

418
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,790
看 我不想說這話 但是這鎮上 有一半人都符合你們的側寫
Look,I hate to say it,but half this town matches most of your profile.

419
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,470
大家在忙什麼呢?
What are you guys working on?

420
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,740
Hotch叫我們看Garcia給的背景資料
Hotch asked if we'd go through garcia's background profiles,

421
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,470
試著找出Joshua與4名被害人的聯繫
try to find a link between joshua and the 4 victims.

422
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,630
你發現什麼了嗎?
You find anything?

423
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,820
他們都有狩獵執照
They all had hunting licenses.

424
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,780
大海撈針啊 我們需要大人物出手
Needle,meet haystack. Yeah,we need the big guns.

425
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,900
正摩拳擦掌準備幹架呢
Ripped and ready to rumble.

426
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,910
或許這一次 你就不用參與了
Uh,maybe you should sit this one out.

427
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,990
不 JJ 我沒事
No,jaje,I'm ok.

428
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,800
把這雜種送到他該去的地方
Put this bastard where he belongs.

429
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,180
- Joshua Beardsley? - 是的 我們認為他是不明疑犯
- Joshua beardsley? - Yeah. We think he's our unsub.

430
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,310
不 他不是
No,he's not.

431
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,390
他符合側寫 最近父親過世 引發他被遺棄的情緒
He fits the profile. Abandonment issue triggered by his father's recent death.

432
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,550
- Reid... - 狩獵經驗
- reid... - Hunting experience,

433
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,850
- 用動物做實驗 - Reid
- Experimentation with animals. - Reid.

434
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,430
你們逮捕了我兒子?
You arrested my son?

435
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,200
我們把他帶去 是為了以防萬一
We brought him in as a precaution.

436
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,140
我告訴你 不是他
I'm telling you,it's not him.

437
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,480
- 你為什麼怎麼肯定? - 因為不明疑犯丟下我跑了
- What makes you so sure? - Because the unsub ran away from me.

438
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,890
他當然會跑 他知道你是FBI
Of course he ran. He knew you were fbi.

439
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,650
但Joshua知道我只是技術人員 他知道我沒有配槍
But joshua knows i'm a techie. He knows I don't carry a weapon.

440
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,600
他要是不明疑犯 我早死了
If he was the unsub,i'd be dead right now.

441
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,380
你怎麼能聽信這些呢 Steve?
How can you be listening to any of this,steve?

442
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,410
你知道Joshua絕不會做這種事的
You know joshua would never do this.

443
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,220
看 我從沒想過 我們中有誰能做出這樣的事
Look,I never thought any of us were capable of doing this.

444
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,680
但死了四個人了 Carol
But 4 people are dead,carol.

445
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,160
你不瞭解他 他是個好孩子
You don't know him. He's a good boy.

446
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,570
他是個近期喪父 情緒壓力很大的好孩子
He's a good boy who recently lost his father and it's a lot of emotional stress.

447
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,930
是挺不容易的 但正在面對 他處理得不錯
It's been tough,but we're coping. He's doing fine.

448
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,660
他為什麼搬回鎮上來?
Why did he move back to town?

449
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,390
我需要他在這媕飢琤散z客棧 我自己一個人顧不過來
I needed him here to help with the inn. I can't handle it on my own.

450
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,470
那對此他怎麼想? 不得不放棄一切搬回來
And how did that make him feel,having to drop everything and move back home?

451
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,630
- 這不是他幹的 - 我們得確定
- He didn't do this. - we need to be sure.

452
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,070
我很肯定 我是他母親
I'm sure. I'm his mother.

453
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,280
Carol 就一個晚上
Carol,it's one night.

454
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,690
要是不出事 你明早來接他
If nothing happens,you pick him up in the morning.

455
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,740
等一下 你說不明疑犯有被遺棄問題
Wait a minute. You said the unsub has abandonment issues.

456
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,580
而Craig Ramey打算離開本鎮 對吧?
And craig ramey was leaving town,right?

Yeah,he couldn't wait to get out of town.

490
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,010
鄰居看見門開著 就報了警
The neighbors saw the door open,called it in.

491
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,370
他從在公開場合埋伏殺人到闖入民宅
He went from ambushing people in public to home invasion.

492
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,510

她的腸被割的到處都是
Her intestines are splayed out everywhere.

Yeah. And the blood on her face is smeared,not splattered.

496
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,140
他虐待過屍體 侵害她的遺體
He played with the body. He mutilated her.

497
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:49,210
如果他的目標是打算離開鎮子的人 為什麼殺的不是Kat Allen?
if this guy's killing people leaving town,why didn't he attack kat allen?

498
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,780
因為她在我們的保護監禁下
Because we had her in protective custody.

499
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,070
他動不了她 就轉移了目標
He couldn't get to her,so he moved on to another target.

500
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,940
目標打破了自己原本的行程
A target who broke her routine.

501
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,470
Carol今晚本來應該留在酒館的
Carol was scheduled to be at the tavern tonight.

502
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,310
不明嫌犯怎麼知道她回家了?
How did the unsub know she was here?

503
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,880
他跟蹤她
He was stalking her.

504
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,670
他殺Carol的原因和之前的不一樣
He chose carol for a different reason.

505
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,470
為什麼? 什麼變了?
Why? What's changed?

506
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,290
你們終於知道我是無辜的啦?
You guys finally realize i'm innocent?

507
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,100
Joshua 請坐下吧
Joshua,please have a seat.

508
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,820
還有問題要問? 你不是吧?
More questions? You serious?

509
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,470
我告訴你 我沒做過
I'm telling you,I didn't do this.

510
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,810
我們知道 請坐下
We know that,son. Please,sit down.

511
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,440
怎麼回事?
What's going on?

512
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,890
Josh 兇手昨晚又殺人了
Josh,the...The killer struck again last night.

513
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,450
天啊 他這次殺誰了?
Ohh,god. Who did he get?

514
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,640
為什麼你們就告訴我這一件事?
Why are you guys only telliling me this?

515
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,200
我媽在哪?
Where's my mom?

516
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,530
不 不 不 不不不不
no. no. No. No,no,no,no.

517
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,450
不不不 不可能
No,no,no,that's impossible.

518
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,880
她剛剛還在這的 我剛剛還跟她說話來著!
She... She was just here. I... I just talked to her!

519
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,020
我很遺憾 Joshua 她走了
I'm sorry,joshua. She's gone.

520
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:02,410
不 不不 你們在騙我
Oh,no. No,no,no,no. No,no. You... You're lying.

521
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,240
我也希望我們是
I wish we were.

522
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,450
- 我要見她 - 現在還不行
- I need to see her. - not right now.

523
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,120
你不想見她現在的樣子
You don't want to think of her that way.

524
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,820
Joshua 我們知道你需要時間平復 但事實是
Joshua,we know you need time to mourn,but the fact of the matter is,

525
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:18,230
兇手還沒抓到 而你能幫我們找到他
the man who did this is still out there,and we think that you can help us find him.

526
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,770
她被殺的時候...我卻被你們鎖在這
You had me locked up while she was...

527
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,230
我本來可以幫她的
I could have helped her.

528
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,770
如果當時你和她在一起 你很有可能也被殺了
If you had gone to her,there's a good chance you'd both be dead.

529
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,370
- 我們需要你的幫助 - 為什麼是我?
- Now we need your help. - Why me?

530
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,760
這些兇殺發生在你回來之後
The murders began when you returned to town.

531
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,420
直到現在 他的目標都是打算離開這鎮上的人
Now,up until now,he's only targeted people who were trying to leave,

532
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,270
但因為某些原因 他和你媽媽卻是有私仇
but for some reason,with your mother,it was personal.

533
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,920
FBI來這媯馴L增加了壓力
the pressure's on. The fbi is here.

534
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,360
在這種情況下 連環殺手通常就想去完成他的最終目的
In that situation,a serial killer wants to finish what he started,

535
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,800
- 去攻擊他真正的目標 - 私人仇恨?
- he goes after the true target of his cause. - Personal?

536
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,090
你能想到有什麼人很怨恨她? 任何人?
Can you think of anyone who had a grudge against her? Anyone at all?

537
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,330
或者有什麼人怨恨你?
How about anyone with a grudge against you?

538
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,410
沒有 沒有 所有人都很喜歡她
No. No. Everybody loved her.

539
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,740
這人有很嚴重的被遺棄問題
The man that we're looking for has severe abandonment issues.

540
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,260
你能想起 你和你媽媽 什麼時候離開過什麼人嗎?
Now,can you think of a time when you or your mother left somebody,

541
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,410
或許一次可怕的分手 或者因為爭吵破壞了友誼?
maybe like a bad break-up or a fight that ended a friendship?

542
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,110
你媽媽曾經在酒館收留過 有家庭問題的人嗎?
Did your mother ever take anyone in at the inn who had family problems,

543
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,920
或者某個被趕出家門的人? 或者突然失去了親人的人?
maybe someone who had been kicked out or lost someone unexpectedly?

544
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,790
不 沒有 沒有這樣的事
No. No,no,no,no,there was nothing like that.

545
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,240
我想在能去看我媽媽了嗎?
Uh,listen,can I go see my mom now?

546
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,970
Josh Josh 你需要讓他們幫忙
Josh. Josh,you need to let these people help.

547
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,690
不 我需要的是...去見我媽媽
No,I need...I need to see my mom.

548
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,620
- 找個人帶你去吧 - 沒事 我認識路
- Well,let's have someone take you. - It's ok. I know the way.

549
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:43,150
你注意到他的變化嗎? 從想幫助我們 到要急著離開 他在說謊
Did you see his behavior shift from wanting to help us to wanting to leave? He's lying.

550
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,110
因為他知道不明嫌犯是誰
Because he knows who the unsub is.

551
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,590
我叫了一個警官跟著Joshua了
I got one of my deputies tailing joshua.

552
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,360
如果他想幹什麼蠢事 我們會知道的
If he does something stupid,we're gonna know.

553
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,720
我們一定忽略了些當中的聯繫 Garcia 有什麼發現嗎?
There's got to be a connection we're missing. Garcia,anything?

554
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,650
他們的生活真是一團糟 我什麼都沒找到
Their lives have been torn apart,figuratively and literally,and I can't find anything.

555
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,490
重新試一次
Try again.

556
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,480
我正在黑入他大學的資料庫
I'm hacking into his college database as we speak.

557
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,640
或許對於他西雅圖的生活 我之前落了些什麼吧
Maybe there's something about his life in seattle I may have missed.

558
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,050
好 為什麼是Carol? 為什麼要侵害屍體? 為什麼要過度殺害?
Good. All right,why carol? Why the mutilation? Why the overkill?

559
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,010
侵害屍體?
Mutilation?

560
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,290
你說過 你在樹林媯o現了一些 被熊侵害過的動物遺體?
You said you found the remains of mutilated animals in the woods from a rabid bear?

561
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,810
- 沒錯 - 照下來了嗎?
- That's right. - Did you take pictures of them?

562
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,140
當然有
Of course we did.

563
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,730
我們記錄了所有能鑒定身份的東西
We documented everything for identification.

564
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,310
我們現在就要看看那些照片
We'll need to see those pictures right away.

565
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,130
- 警長 我們需要調整之前的側寫 - 什麼意思?
- Sheriff,we need to adjust the profile. - What do you mean?

566
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,300
這些動物屍體不是被熊糟蹋的
These animals weren't mutilated by a rabid bear.

567
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,350
是人為的
Someone did this.

568
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,650
- 你的意思是 一個人 - 如果是動物 不會留下那麼多遺體的
- You mean a person. - An animal wouldn't have left so much.

569
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,720
我們之前就應該想到 這是典型的行兇前兆
We should have seen it before. It's homicidal triad 101.

570
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,220
我們之前說過 兇手沒有特定目標 特定模式
We said the kills were all over the map.

571
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,840
不明嫌疑人沒有經驗 行兇時不成熟 因為他本身就不夠成熟
The unsub lacks sophistication and shows immaturity in his kills because he is immature.

572
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,590
他拿動物做試手 是因為他從小就被教成這樣
He started with animals because that's what he was taught ever since he was a child.

573
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,620
當他試煩了動物 他就向更有難度的目標挑戰
and when he got bored with animals,he moved on to more challenging prey.

574
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,380
- 人類 - 不明嫌犯是一個青少年
- People. - Your unsub's a teenage boy.

575
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,640
我們之前說過的男孩 他不是曾經就讀於此
The boy we were talking about before,he wouldn't be a former student,

576
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,580
而是在校生 一個非常迷戀打獵的青少年
he'd be a current student,a teenager who loves to hunt.

577
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,870
我這堬{在只有兩個青少年 而且都是女的
I only have two teenagers right now. Both of them are girls.

578
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,320
說吧 Garcia
Go ahead,garcia.

579
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,160
我發現一件超詭異的事
I found something uber weird.

580
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,470
Joshua在申請大學的文章
In joshua's college application essay,

581
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,490
寫到了為人兄長對他生活的影響
he talks about the impact that being an older brother had on his life.

582
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,970
我記得他沒有兄弟姐妹
I thought he didn't have any siblings.

583
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,840
他沒有 但他還是提到 棄兄弟於不顧有多艱難
He doesn't,and yet he's talking about how hard it was to leave him behind

584
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,950
在他搬去安克雷奇之後 讓他缺乏保護
when he moved to anchorage,to leave him unprotected.

585
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,740
謝謝
Thanks.

586
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,560
Joshua搬家前 有沒有罩著什麼學生?
Was there a student that joshua may have taken under his wing before he moved away?

587
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,680
你覺得可能遭受虐待的人?
Someone you may have suspected was being abused?

588
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,590
- 我的天啊 - 怎麼了?
- Oh,my god. - What?

589
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,780
Owen Porter 他輟學在家了
Owen porter. He's not a student anymore. He's home-schooled.

590
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,370
他倆穿一條開襠褲長大的
Joshua and he were attached at the hip when they were younger.

591
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,420
我被叫去Porter家幾次
I've been called out to the porter house several times.

592
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,930
家庭暴力
Domestic disturbance.

593
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,200
Owen和他媽媽一直護著爸爸
Owen and his mom always covering for the dad.

594
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,460
- 咱們走 - 謝了
- Let's go. - Thanks.

595
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,910
說說遺棄問題
Talk about abandonment issues.

596
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,440
Owen落入父親手中任其宰割
Owen was left victim to the abusive hand of his father.

597
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,330
Joshua回來 擾亂了Owen的精神狀態
Joshua's return probably derailed owen's mental stability.

598
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,240
加上意外擊中Jon Baker 他崩潰了
Add to that the accidental shooting of jon baker and he snapped.

599
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,630
- 他享受初次殺戮的快感 - 他一定要再來一次
- He got off on that first killing. - He had to do it again.

600
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,760
所以他瞄準要離開小鎮的人
So he targeted people trying to leave town.

601
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,560
在他看來 有人離開 他就會受到傷害
In his mind,when people leave,he gets hurt.

602
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,910
Carol奪走Joshua 他記恨在心 所以殺了她 他就再也不會走了
And he resented carol for taking joshua away,so he killed her to make sure he never left again.

603
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,930
他現在會去哪兒?
Where would he go now?

604
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,230
我們依山傍水 他隨處可去
We're surrounded by waterways and mountains. He could be anywhere.

605
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,670
- Porter先生 你兒子在家嗎? - 關你鳥事?
- Mr. Porter,is your son at home? - What's it to you?

606
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,690
關了電視
Turn that off.

607
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,240
- 你知道了嗎? - 不知道你在說啥!
- Did you know? - Don't know what you're talking about!

608
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,760
不確定 直到昨天晚上
Not for sure. Not until last night.

609
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,040
- 他渾身是血地回來 - 他不在這兒 窗戶開著
- He came home covered in blood. - He's not here. But the window's open.

610
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,540
這不是你第一次 幫他洗掉身上的血跡了吧?
It's not the first time you've washed blood out of his clothes,is it?

611
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,110
- 別理他們 Martha! - 坐下 別插嘴
- Don't answer them,martha! - Sit down and shut up.

612
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,810
我保證他不會再傷害你了
I promise he will not lay a hand on you again.

613
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,870
不 不是第一次了
no. It wasn't the first time.

614
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,350
Porter太太 我知道你只是 想保護Owen 但是你不能這樣了
Mrs. Porter,I understand you're only trying to protect owen,but you can't anymore.

615
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,460
他一直都與眾不同 他不像我們
He's always been different. He's not like us.

616
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,200
他小的時候就經常到森林堨h 帶著一身血回來
When he was a little boy,he used to go out into the woods and come home covered in blood.

617
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,100
你為什麼不告訴別人 Martha?
Why didn't you tell anyone,martha?

618
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,630
你眼睜睜看著別人死掉 怎麼還能還坐得住?
How could you just sit there and do nothing while people died?

619
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,620
Joshua被送走時Owen什麼反應?
How did owen react when joshua was sent away?

620
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,180
他也想走
He wanted to leave,too.

621
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,600
但是我不許
But I couldn't let him.

622
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,300
Porter太太 你知道社交隔離 會對小孩造成什麼影響嗎?
Mrs. Porter,do you have any idea what social isolation does to a child?

I'm trying to help him.There's a mob out there,

642
