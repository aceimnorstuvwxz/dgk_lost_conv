00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,630
哦
Well

6
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,200
我們得通知FBI 又開始了
We need to call the fbi. It's starting again.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,270
你餓嗎? 要不要去吃點東西?
You hungry? You want to grab something?

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,470
別裝出一副很關心的樣子
Don't try and act like you care.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,720
我只想知道你餓不餓
I just want to know if you're hungry.

10
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,590
不 我不餓
No,i'm not hungry.

11
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,780
- 我可不是你的敵人 Jane - 當然不是
- I'm not the enemy,jane. - Of course not.

12
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,270
我的朋友才是敵人 對吧? 還有David
My friends are,right? And david.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,200
你才14歲 這麼小不該約會
You're 14.It's too young to go on dates,

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,810
尤其是和一個會開車的男生約會
especially with a boy who's already driving.

15
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,780
老媽說你花太多時間工作
Mom thinks you work too much.

16
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,700
這又有什麼關係?
What does that have to do with anything?

17
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,590
你們倆合不來 又不是我的錯
It's not my fault that you two don't get along.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,100
我不是這意思
I'm not saying it is.

19
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,620
你想把我攆走
You're trying to ship me off.

20
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,170
- 你媽和我都愛你 - 別來這套...
- Your mom and i love you. - Don't even.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,590
好吧 你想被當做成年人對待 行啊
Ok. You want to be treated like an adult,fine.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,940
那我們就來場成年人之間的對話
Let's have an adult conversation.

23
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,120
有什麼能幫你嗎?
Can i help you?

今晚那麼多直升機在幹嘛呢?
What do you think's going on with the helicopters tonight?

25
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,660
抱歉 我只想跟我女兒談談
I'm sorry,i'm trying to have a conversation with my daughter.

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,570
我沒在問你 我在問Jane
I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to jane.

27
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,130
- 你怎麼知道我女兒的名字? - 這堣ㄛO你說了算
- How do you know my daughter's name? - You're not in charge here.

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,420
- Jane 你先跑 - 不行!
- Jane,run ahead. - No!

29
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:12,360
你們保持安靜 否則都會死
No,you come quiet. Or you both die.

- Hotch. - Cooper.

32
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,470
你不是坐辦公室的料
You never were one for offices.

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,140
身體問題 我對官僚主義過敏
A medical condition. I'm allergic to bureaucracy.

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,780
- 謝謝你能來 Hotch - 不客氣
- Thanks for coming,hotch. - Sure.

35
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,250
- 我沒多少時間 我們要趕去辦案 - 我知道 舊金山
- I don't have long. We're leaving on a case. - I know. San francisco.

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,710
- 我聽說了 - 到底怎麼回事?
- I hear things. - So what's going on?

37
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,730
你對正在調查的案子瞭解多少?
How much you know about this case you're working?

I'm on my way in to look at the files.

39

- 要我給你做個匯報嗎? - 好的
- Can i give you a preview? - Sure.

40
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,440
好了 事情是這樣的
All right,so, here's the deal.

41
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,150
2年前 普雷西迪奧公園發現一名男性死者
2 years ago,a dead male turned up in presidio park.

42
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,760
遍體鱗傷
A massive amount of blunt force trauma.

43
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,740
包括自衛時留下的傷口 後腦勺中彈
Defensive wounds, single gunshot to the back of the head.

44
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:41,090
接下來的3天 又有3名遇害者 相同的作案手法 那之後就斷了線
And over the next 3 days, 3 more vics,same m.o., and after that, there was nothing.

45
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,490
一整年後 同樣的案子
Until exactly one year later. Same thing.

46
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,700
男性死者 身體受重傷 被槍斃(頭部中彈)
Dead male,badly beaten, shot execution style,

47
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,410
接下來的3天 又有3人遇害
Followed by 3 more vics over the next 3 days.

48
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,270
- 然後又風平浪靜 直到昨晚 - 剛好一整年
- And then nothing until last night. - One year later. Exactly.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,240
在線索斷掉之前 我們有3天時間
Which means we have 3 days before the trail goes cold again.

50
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,290
為什麼這麼感興趣?
Why all the interest?

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,510
我有看法 我認為 有另外謀殺案和這案子有聯繫
I got a theory. I think there are parallel murders linked to these cases.

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,360
2年前 在兇殺案停止後1天
2 years ago,one day after those murders stopped,

53
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,220
單身父親和15歲的黑髮女兒陳屍車中
A single dad and his 15-year-old brunette daughter were found dead in their car.

54
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,760
去年...
Last year...

55
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,560
同樣 男性死者停止出現後一天 一樣的案件
Again,one day after the dead males stopped showing up, same thing.

56
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,890
另一個父親和黑髮女兒
Another dad and his brunette daughter.

57
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,230
你認為這些都有聯繫?
And you think it's all connected?

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,870
世上沒這麼巧的事 你覺得呢?
I think it's a hell of a coincidence,don't you?

59
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,490
- 你想讓我帶你的人去跟進這案子 - 你只有3天的時間
- And you want me to bring your team in on the case. - You only have 3 days.

60
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
你可沒時間追蹤這類交叉案件
I mean,you don't have time to be chasing an angle like this one.

61
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,140
我的人在普雷西迪奧公園調查死者
So my team works the bodies in presidio park

62
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,330
而你的人著手父女遇害案
while your team tests the theory about the fathers and daughters.

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,170
如果我是對的 兩個案子能相互幫助
And if i'm right, both halves of the case help solve the other half.

64
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,210
你已經問過主任 但她不答應
And you already asked the director and she said no.

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,440
她的腦子還沒開竅
She is not strong at thinking outside the box.

66
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,250
如果你忽視她命令 而且錯了 那你就玩完了
If you ignore her order and you're wrong, you're done.

67
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,250
聽我說 Hotch...
I'm telling you,hotch...

68
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,110
你我說話這會兒 一個父親和他女兒正失蹤了
Right now,there's a father and there's a daughter and they're missing,

69
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,080
而且沒人在找他們
and no one is looking for them.

70
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,160
- 停下 停下 - 如果我能砸斷鏈子...
- Stop it. Stop it. - If i can snap this chain...

71
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,330
你只會弄傷自己
You're just gonna hurt yourself.

72
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,470
- 停下 求你了! 求你停下! 快停下! - 你沒事吧?
- Stop it,please,please! Please stop it!Stop! - You ok?

73
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,100
你離她遠點
You stay away from her.

74
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,300
我說了 離她遠點
I said get away from her.

75
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,090
- 你到底想怎麼? - 很簡單
- What the hell do you want? - It's simple.

76
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,540
你把她交給我 你倆都能活著
You give her to me, you both live.

77
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,320
你去死
Go to hell.

78
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,700
如果這是你的答案...
If that's your answer.

Mother teresa said, "i have found the paradox.

81
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:35,060
"如果愛至成傷 你就會發現 傷痛盡失 卻平添愛意"
"that if you love until it hurts, "there can be no more hurt, only more love."

82
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,970
過去幾年的受害者 我們都知道些什麼?
What do we know about the past years' victims?

83
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,320
Tenderloin區是 毒販和流浪漢高度集中的地方
The tenderloin district is a high concentration of drug addicts and homeless people.

84
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,720
所有的受害者都是短期居留者
All the victims have been transients.

85
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,320
所以不明嫌犯選擇的 都是些沒人留意的易下手的目標
So this unsub's choosing easy targets that won't be missed.

86
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,460
他不用擔心獵取目標的難度
He's not concerned with the challenge of the hunt.

87
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,260
每次殺人 都只是他龐大計劃的冰山一角
All these victims are part of a larger plan.

88
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,720
過去幾年來 他一直固定在這幾天作案
Which he executes in the same few days every year.

89
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,570
Reid 作案的日期有什麼特殊意義嗎?
Reid did you find any significance to the dates?

90
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,700
沒有什麼歷史意義 一定只是對不明嫌犯有特殊意義
Nothing historical. It's got to be personal for the unsub.

91
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,240
JJ 你和Reid去舊金山警察局
Jj,you and reid hit the san francisco p.d.

92
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,380
Rossi和Prentiss去拋屍現場
Rossi and prentiss to the dumpsite.

93
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,560
Morgan和我就去找驗屍官
Morgan and i will go to the coroner's office.

94
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,670
接下來三天大家都不用想睡覺了
Nobody should expect to get a lot of sleep in the next 3 days.

95
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,050
- 那Cooper的小隊呢? - 你說他有推斷
- What about cooper's team? - You said he had a theory.

96
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,070
他相信那個殺害了那些流浪漢的人
He believes that whoever is murdering these homeless men

97
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,570
同時還綁架父女 並且在拋屍後 殺害父女
Is also abducting fathers and daughters and killing them once the transients are disposed of.

98
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,190
所以我們就負責流浪漢
So then we'll investigate the dead men,

99
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,270
他們小隊就負責調查是否有失蹤父女的事
And his team can see if there is a missing father and daughter.

100
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,200
為什麼他們小隊不跟我們一起來?
Why isn't his team on the jet now?

101
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,310
因為主任不批准他們加入調查
Because the director wouldn't authorize them joining the investigation.

102
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,460
他們要違反主任的命令?
They're working against the director's orders?

103
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,590
我們要關心的是被綁架的流浪漢
We need to concentrate on the dead men abducted from the tenderloin.

104
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,140
Cooper的小隊能幫忙調查 是否真有失蹤父女
Cooper's team can help determine if there's a missing father and daughter

105
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,720
他們的失蹤是否與我們的案子有關
And whether it's connected to our case.

106
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,150
如果主任發現你也在違抗她命令 你是在自找麻煩
Or you could get in serious hot water if the director thinks you're helping to defy her.

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,200
不 Hotch是對的
No,hotch is right.

108
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,940
我認識Sam Cooper不止20年了 我從沒見過他違抗命令
I've known sam cooper for 20 years, and i've never seen him defy an order.

109
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,100
如果他強烈地相信自己的直覺 我們應該盡我們所能幫助他
If he feels this strong about a hunch, we need to help him however we can.

至少我們有個好裝備 你是怎麼找到這地方的?
At least we're blessed with a nice setup. How'd you hook it up?

San francisco has a population of 800,000. Half of those are males.

123

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,990
- 所以那就是...? - 36萬
- So what does that leave? - 360000.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,230
那麼白人女性18萬 查一下學校缺勤率
That's gets us to 180,000. Check school absences.

127
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,840
把範圍縮小到13到18歲的 深色頭髮白人女孩
Narrow that to girls 13 to 18 and narrow it again to brunettes.

128
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,360
查到他們父親的名字  再查查他們當中沒去上班的
Find their fathers' names and check their workplaces, who hasn't shown up.

129
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,440
沒問題 如果你想炫耀一下
Well,ok. If you want to show off about it.

130
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,520
好 出發 開工
All right. Let's ride. Let's get to work.

131
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,290
所有的拋屍現場都這麼荒無人煙嗎?
Have all the dumpsites been this isolated?

132
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,710
<i>普雷西迪奧公園</i>

133
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,030
他總是把屍體扔在遠離主道和光亮的地段
He keeps away from the main paths. Never dumps them in lighted areas.

134
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,270
所以他一定已經事先研究過地形 說明他有組織性
So he had to have studied the terrain beforehand. He's organized.

135
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,820
而且體格強壯到能一個人 拖著屍體走一段很長的路
And physical enough to haul a body a long way on his own.

136
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,780
受害者方面的資料呢?
What can you tell us about the victims?

137
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,230
他們都無家可歸 沒有目擊者
They were all living on the streets. No witnesses.

138
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,310
我們猜想 他用食物或者毒品誘惑他們
Our guess is he managed to lure them, promising food or drugs.

139
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,430
- 有任何人報告他們的失蹤嗎? - 沒有
- Were any reported missing? - No.

140
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,600
但是他們都來自Tenderloin 相同的幾個街區
We do know they all came from the same few blocks in the tenderloin.

141
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
這是在普雷西迪奧公園的那具屍體
This is the body they found at presidio park.

142
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,220
就算沒中彈 也很有可能死於內出血
If he hadn't been shot, he probably would have died of internal bleeding.

143
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,210
看來自己也開了幾槍
It looks like he landed a few shots of his own.

144
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,550
他的頭蓋骨上有火藥的殘留物
There's powder residue in his skull.

145
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,600
被射殺的時候他已經被制服了
He had to have been subdued when he was shot.

146
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,440
嫌犯不聲不響地從街上把他綁走 所以沒有目擊者
So he gets abducted off the street quietly enough that there's no witnesses,

147
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,030
之後他拚命反抗 難道只是為了 讓不明嫌犯以處決的方式把他射死?
But then he fights for his life only to let the unsub shoot him execution style?

148
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,310
換句話說就是  他到底對他們做了些什麼?
In other words,what the hell is he doing with them?

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,360
打開他手銬 
Unlock 'em.

150
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,500
還沒說開始!
Not yet!

151
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,580
起來 我來說說規則 
Get up. Let's go.

152
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,100
先把鑰匙丟一邊 
Throw the key off to the side.

153
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,060
勝者生存
You win,you live.

154
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:13,390
輸了 先殺了你女兒 再幹掉你 
You lose, i kill your daughter, and i kill you.

155
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,350
明白? 
Understand?

156
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,870
你能站起來嗎? 能站起來嗎?
Can you stand? Can you stand?

157
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,270
別偷看 Jane 
Don't look,jane.

158
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,450
好的 我們已經聯繫過200多所中學 讓他們提供缺席女孩的名字 
Ok,we've talked to over 200 middle schools and run the names of absent girls

159
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,550
- 然後比對他們的年鑒照片確定其人 - 還有什麼? 
- against their yearbook photos. - What else?

160
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,810
我們正在排查這份名單中 每位學生父親所在的單位 
We're checking bios of the dads now and calling their workplaces.

161
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,900
他沒來上班 你肯定嗎? 
So he hasn't been at work. You sure?

162
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,220
兩天了嗎? 謝謝 
Both days? Thank you.

163
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,600
有線索嗎? 
What have we got?

164
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,070
這是Jane McBride 現年14 
This is jane mcbride. She's 14.

165
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,000
昨天和今早都沒去學校
She didn't show up for school yesterday or this morning.

166
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,570
- 她爸爸呢? - Ben
- And dad? - Ben.

167
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,530
他跟公司失去聯繫也兩天了
He hasn't been at his contracting company for the last 2 days.

168
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,120
我愛死這哥們了 
I love this guy.

169
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,940
咱們的先知說的對 愛死 大愛
And the prophet speaks. Yes. Yes.

170
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:18,180
Hotch 我是Cooper 我想我們找到他了 
Hotch. Cooper. I think we found him.

171
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,120
McBride太太 我是FBI的Hotchner探員 這位是Cooper探員
Mrs. Mcbride? I'm agent hotchner with the fbi. This is agent cooper.

172
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,490
我們來確認你丈夫和你女兒是否失蹤 
We're here to determine whether your husband and your daughter are missing.

173
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,690
- 別... - 太太 你還好嗎?
- Don't. - Ma'am,are you ok?

174
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,220
先進來 求你們 快點 
Just get inside,please. Hurry.

175
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,440
- 噢 上帝 - McBride太太 
- Oh,god. - Mrs. Mcbride.

176
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,690
你們會害死我家人的
You just got my family murdered.

177
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,880
他是第一個公園受害者 
That's the first victim from the park.

178
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,390
那個男人在電話中告誡我 如果我報警 他會殺死Ben和Jane
The man on the phone said he'd kill ben and jane if i brought in the police.

179
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,350
他說如果我需要證明 可以去前門口看看 我照他說的去看 就發現了這個
He said that if i needed proof, i should check my front porch, and when i did, this was there.

180
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,720
他很謹慎 
Oh,he's careful.

181
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,880
沒有線索能找出他的身份和所在
Nothing to distinguish him or his location.

182
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,300
他還說什麼了嗎? 
Were there any other instructions?

183
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,820
沒 他只說還會來電話
No,he said he'd call with more.

184
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,260
你們認為他會監視我家嗎? 
Do you think he's watching?

185
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,250
我的意思 他會殺死我的家人嗎? 
I mean,is he going to kill them?

186
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,990
這段視頻是放在三腳架上的攝像機拍的 這意味著他可能沒有搭檔 
The video was shot by a camera on a tripod, which means he probably doesn't have a partner.

187
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,990
因此他不可能兩頭兼顧 既要囚監你的家人又來監視你家
It would be almost impossible for him to take your family prisoner and do surveillance simultaneously.

188
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,120
那他之前這麼做過嗎? 
And he's done this before?

189
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,720
為何沒人自告奮勇站出來揭發這些事? 
So why didn't someone come forward after to say what happened?

190
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,670
知道這事的人都死了
He doesn't leave anybody with knowledge alive.

191
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,710
我們會安排一個探員在這保護你的安全 
We'll post an agent here to keep you safe.

192
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,180
你能讓我們單獨談談嗎? 
Can you excuse us a moment?

193
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,620
Cooper 聽著 你的推論是對的 
Cooper,listen. Your theory's right.

194
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,760
可以肯定他在獵殺無家可歸的男人 以及有家的父女 
We know he's killing homeless men as well as fathers and daughters.

195
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,690
但讓我們從這接手吧 
But let us work it.

196
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,080
如果你現在回華盛頓 主任不會知道你無視她的命令
If you go back to d.c. Now,the director won't know that you ignored her order.

197
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,000
聽著 我知道你想替我擔這事
Look,i know you're sticking your neck out on this thing for me.

198
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,560
- 我理解 我並不想... - 別擔心我
- I understand.I'm not trying to-- - this isn't about me.

199
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,790
我是想保護你
I want to protect you.

200
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,190
- 還記得他嗎?  - Toby Vahl 當然 
- You remember him? - Toby vahl. Of course.

201
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,330
記得嗎 兇手已經招了殺了五個孩子 但你我都有種感覺
You remember we got that confession for those 5 child murders, but we all had that gut feeling.

202
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,060
我們覺得並非他一人所為 這五個受害者類型太不一樣了
We knew he wasn't good for all of them. The preference was too varied.

203
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,300
當地警察結束了調查 
Local cops shut the investigation down.

204
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,570
FBI就厚著臉皮發號施令了 叫我們拍拍屁股回總部 
The fbi brass,they told us to get our asses back home.

205
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,420
我當然記得 
I remember.

206
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,330
這孩子的屍體是另一個兇手拋掉的 聽說這事時 你在哪兒?
Where were you when you heard they caught that second killer dumping this boy's body?

207
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,670
我在丹佛跟進一個新案子 你呢? 
I was in denver working a new case. You?

208
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,480
我當時手堥S有案子 可以一直待在那兒
I wasn't on anything yet. I could have still been there.

209
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,750
我不會再無視自己的預感和直覺了
I won't ignore my gut again.

210
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,310
- 我不管這樣值不值得  - 好吧 
- I don't care what it costs me. - Ok.

211
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,880
我的人也會一起跟進 我們的人手會增加一倍 
My people will be on the record and we'll use yours to double manpower.

212
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,310
我是Hotchner 哪? 
Hotchner. Where?

213
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,880
好的 他們發現了另一具屍體 
Ok. They found another body.

214
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,900
<i>罪案現場 普雷西迪奧公園</i>

215
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,760
- 一個英國佬怎麼...  - 是個英俊的英國佬 
- So how does a brit-- - a handsome brit.

216
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,730
一個英國佬怎麼加入了美國聯邦調查局? 
How does a brit end up in the fbi?

217
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,420
很簡單 Cooper和我不期而遇過多次
It's pretty simple. Cooper and i bumped into each other a few times.

218
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,930
10個月前 他們讓他自己挑人組個小組
10 months ago they told him he could hand-pick a new team.

219
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,100
他通知我 我就來了 跟國籍沒關係
He called. I came. Passport didn't matter.

220
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,530
聽說英國特種部隊的人 都不能承認自己的身份
So,is it true that no one in the british special forces is allowed to admit they're in it?

221
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,720
我不知道 我還得打聽打聽呢
I don't know. I'd have to ask around about that one.

222
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,150
- 你知道 關於你上司 流言可不少 - 是麼?
- You know,there's a lot of rumors about your boss. - Yeah?

223
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,240
我聽說 他離開BAU時 正在海外參與心理戰
One i heard was when he left the bau, he was doing psychological ops overseas.

224
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,080
嗯 我對這些八卦從來不感興趣
Well... I've never been big on rumors.

225
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:16,710
我猜你也不會告訴我 你們在哪偶遇了
So,i don't suppose you're going to tell me just where you two bumped into each other.

226
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,370
我可以告訴你 我全身心信任他
I'll tell you i trust the man with my life.

227
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,060
我可以為他去拚命
I'll tell you i'd die for the man.

228
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,840
- 失蹤者家屬怎麼樣了? - 她在堅持 但我不覺得她能幫上忙
- How's the mom? - She's holding up. I don't know how much help she's going to be.

229
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,850
Tenderloin區到處是癮君子 容易控制
So,the tenderloin is full of junkies who would be easy to control,

230
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,170
但第一個死者體內沒有毒品 這怪傢伙看起來也挺健康
But the first victim had no drugs in his system, and this geezer looks pretty healthy,too.

231
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,320
除了他已經死了這個事實外
Except for the whole dead thing.

232
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,700
他的指甲埵野祧妥搵d
There's skin under his nails.

233
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,420
第一個受害者胸部不是有抓痕麼
Didn't the first victim have scratch marks on his chest?

234
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,080
對 我們猜想死者跟不明嫌犯打鬥過
Yeah. We assumed he fought back against the unsub,

235
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,190
事實上 這些受害者可能是彼此毆鬥
But these victims might actually be fighting each other.

236
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,940
一點沒錯
Exactly.

237
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,710
我猜 你有個可以震驚我的結論了
I take it you're about to wow me with a theory.

238
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,280
第一個死者在父女失蹤前被拋屍 為什麼
The first victim is dumped before the fathers and daughters are taken. Why?

239
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,020
因為他要提醒失蹤者家屬 他是認真的
Because he wants to send a message to the wife that he means business,

240
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,480
保證她不會報警
Make sure she doesn't call the police.

241
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,070
而且還給他綁架了的人一個信息
And it also sends a message to the prisoners he already has.

242
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,760
打不過 就得死 你怎麼看這些傷痕?
You lose a fight,you die. What do those welts look like to you?

243
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,920
我的想法 橡皮子彈打的
My guess--they're wounds from rubber bullets.

244
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,710
- 跟獄警平息監獄騷亂用的子彈一樣 - 沒錯
- Like they use to control rioters or prison inmates. - Ok.

245
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,160
我認為不明嫌犯曾經入獄過
I think the unsub's been locked up.

246
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,340
在那堨L學會了怎麼控制囚犯
That's where he's learned to control his own prisoners.

247
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,210
如果他懂得控制 為啥還要他們打鬥
Well,if he's learned how to dominate them, why are they fighting each other?

248
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,930
這肯定是他計劃的一部分
It has to be part of his plan--

249
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,870
親眼看著他們互相打鬥
To watch them beat the hell out of each other.

250
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,190
然後處決失敗者
And then the loser is executed.

251
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,630
承認吧 覺得我有兩把刷子了吧
Admit it--i'm starting to grow on you.

252
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,330
Hotch 是Emily
Hotch,it's emily.

253
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,440
我們可能知道他對受害者做了什麼
We have an idea about what he might be doing with the victims.

254
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,200
我們可以開始側寫了 等等
We may be able to give the profile-- Hold on a second.

255
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,500
嗨 你在打給誰
Hey,who are you calling?

256
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,700
如果我是對的 還有人需要知道
If i'm right, there's somewhere else we need to be delivering that profile.

257
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,700
<i>聖昆廷監獄</i>

258
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,530
- 這是你書媦g的地方吧 - 沒錯 你在這花了很多時間麼
- This is one for the books,huh? - Yeah. You spend much time here?

259
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,730
可能做過六次面談 你呢
Maybe a half a dozen interviews. You?

260
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,790
待了六年三個月零四天
6 years,3 months, 4 days.

261
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,580
- 我們的先知回來了 - 最近如何 兄弟
- The prophet returns. - What up,man? How you doin'?

262
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,020
這是Nelson G. 我們就是在那時候認識的
This is nelson g. Me and him know each other from back in the dark days.

263
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,180
我從沒想過還能在這再見到你
Man. Never expected to ever see you in here again.

264
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,890
- 這是FBI的David Rossi探員 - FBI?
- This is agent david rossi,fbi. - Fbi?

265
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,560
這麼快你就被FBI抓回來了?
The first time i see you in how long and you bring the fbi?

266
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,980
不是吧
Get the hell outta here.

267
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:04,180
我說過如果我能贖罪 我會棄暗投明
I told you,man, if i ever got my shot at redemption, i was gonna take my game to the other side.

268
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,500
"開瞎子的眼 領被囚的出牢獄"
"to open the blind eyes, "to take the prisoner out of the prison and them...

269
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,660
"領坐於黑暗的出監牢"(以賽亞書42.7)
And them that sit in darkness out of the prison house."

270
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,410
我猜事實確實是這樣的
Well... It makes sense, i guess.

271
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,390
規則都是罪犯定的 警察只能學著適應
The criminals are the ones who make the rules,right? Cops are the ones who gotta learn.

272
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,370
- 我需要你的幫助 - 說吧
- I need your help,man. - Talk.

273
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,460
我們在抓捕一個連壞殺手
We have a serial killer.

274
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,380
我們認為他在這服過刑
We think he might have done time here.

275
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,340
我們有側寫 如果認識他 告訴我們
We want to give you a description, and then you tell us if you recognize him.

276
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,600
利用下你獄中的關係
Just press your connections.

277
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,020
這個不明嫌犯很可能有犯罪記錄
It's very likely that this unsub has a prison record.

278
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,710
白人 據被綁者的年齡判斷 嫌犯30多歲
He's white,and judging by the age of the people he abducts, most likely in his 30s.

279
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
考慮到他棄屍的地點
And considering the terrain in which he's dumping the bodies,

280
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,950
我們認為他很強壯 至少身體很健康
We think that he's imposing or at least very physically fit.

281
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,870
他有足夠的空間來囚禁 控制這些受害者
He also has access to a space that's large enough to house and control a number of prisoners,

282
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,870
不會打擾到鄰居
All without disturbing the neighbors.

283
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,010
這傢伙堅守著相同的綁架和拋屍地點
This guy keeps to the same hunting ground. Same dumpsite.

284
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,430
證明他是個真正有組織的控制狂
He's a control freak. Real organized.

285
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,580
而且 他沉迷於模仿監獄的守衛
Also,he would have been obsessed with the guards,

286
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,150
尤其是在放風時控制犯人的方式
Their methods of controlling the prisoners, especially in the yard.

287
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,810
這個人每年會在同樣的時間殺人
This dude kills folks the same few days every year.

288
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,910
他如此沉迷 他不可能沒有談論過
There's no way he's that obsessed and he's not talking about it.

289
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,860
我們認為他有個像Jane 那樣的深發女兒
We think the man has a daughter of his own, most likely a brunette like jane.

290
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,400
他選的作案日期 很可能跟發生 在他女兒身上的事件一致
The dates he chooses probably correspond to an event involving his own daughter.

291
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,170
我們猜測他女兒可能丟了
Our guess is that he lost his daughter in some way

292
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,090
而且當時不在她身邊
And it's symbolic of him not fighting for her in the first place.

293
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,620
很多時間殺手都會選替代品下手  比如妻子或者母親
A lot of times killers choose victims that are surrogates for someone, like a wife or a mother.

294
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,900
我們認為他選了自己的替代人下手
In this case, we think his own guilt is making him choose surrogates that represent himself.

295
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,400
警部的人都知道側寫了 他們在Tenderloin加倍巡邏
The police department has the profile. They've tripled patrols in the tenderloin.

296
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,230
我想這堣]需要有人來側寫
You know what? I think we need profilers out here,too.

297
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,710
不明嫌犯會來街上 綁架流浪漢 帶回去和父親對毆
He could be out there hunting for homeless men to fight the father.

298
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,500
這小子 他是我見過最好的狙擊手
This kid--best sniper i've ever seen.

299
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,020
他在房屋上射擊靈敏
He could view a lot of ground from the rooftop.

300
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,740
- 你願意在地面呼應他嗎 - 當然
- Are you comfortable on the ground solo? - Of course.

301
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,430
Cooper說得對 我們可以在他 誘拐另一個受害者的時候將他抓獲
Cooper's right. Maybe we can catch him trying to abduct another victim.

302
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,660
<i>Tenderloin區</i>

303
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,470
你什麼裝備?
So,what you wearing?

304
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,780
槍
A gun.

305
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,600
嘿 Mick 告訴我
Hey,mick, explain something to me.

306
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,650
怎麼我在地上 你卻安坐在房頂上呢
How come i'm out on the street and you're sitting on your butt on some roof?

307
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,690
你聽到頭兒說的話了
Well,you heard the man.

308
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,780
還需要我解釋自己的非凡能力嗎
Do you really want me to expound on my own prowess?

309
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,570
那會傷了你自尊心
It's undignified.

310
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,820
聽好 所有受害人都來自方圓4街區以內
Stay on your headset. All his victims are coming from this 4-block radius.

311
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,200
嘿 Jane 親愛的 省點力氣
Hey,jane,honey, just save your strength.

312
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,250
你不能再打了
You can't fight again.

313
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,700
我沒有選擇
I don't have a choice.

314
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,610
就算他們把我每根骨頭都打斷了 我也不在乎
I don't care if they break every bone in my body.

315
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,380
我向你保證 我不會放棄的
I promise you i'm not gonna stop.

316
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,130
我有發現了
Ok,i've got something.

317
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,680
我不太確定 東南角上
I'm not sure if it's anything, but southeast corner.

318
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,090
看到緊跟著那癮君子的男人了嗎?
See the guy clocking the junkie?

319
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,330
說明確點兒行不? 到處有人跟著癮君子啊
You care to expand on that? All i see are guys clocking junkies.

320
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,070
- 灰色襯衫的 - 好 我看到了
- Gray shirt. - Yeah,i got him.

321
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,270
跟緊點 我就來
Stay close. I'm on my way.

322
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,430
他在往南走 FBI! 別動!
He's heading south,ben. Fbi! Stop!

323
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,260
- 別動! - 我什麼都沒做!
- Stop! - I didn't do anything!

324
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,700
你幹嗎跟著那個人?
Why were you following that man?

325
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,940
我知道他有貨 我就是癮頭犯了
I knew he was holding. I just wanted a fix.

326
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,160
我不販毒
I don't distribute.

327
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,010
爸爸!
Dad!

328
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,100
幹嘛這麼堅持呢  她跟我一起更好 我們都知道
Why keep this up? She's better off with me. We both know it.

329
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,560
很快 她就會知道這些
Soon,this will be all she knows.

330
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,420
你讓她每天自己走路去學校
You let her walk home from school every day on her own.

331
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,160
她跟我在一起會很安全 Ben
She'll be safe with me,ben.

332
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,350
她甚至不會想你
She won't even miss you.

333
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,790
你不會把我打倒的!
You won't break me!

334
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,210
那就把他打死
Then it's to the death.

335
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,370
你不打死他 我就殺了Jane
To the death, or i kill jane.

336
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,720
要麼他死 要麼Jane死
To the death, or jane dies.

337
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,610
最後一次機會
Last chance.

338
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,990
我很抱歉 抱歉
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

339
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,240
對不起
I'm sorry.

340
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,790
分析員把數據給我們了嗎
Did your analyst get us the data?

341
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,560
恩 我可以給你一份
Yeah,i can lay it out for you.

342
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,000
很好 把它和我們的嫌疑犯庫交叉比對
Good. Let's cross-reference it against our potential suspect pool.

343
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,740
嗯 我們能過去
Hello. Yeah,we can be there.

344
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,510
要一起去聖昆汀監獄嗎?
You up for a ride to san quentin?

345
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,940
跟以前一樣了 整天去監獄堮M話
It's like the old days, spending all your time interviewing prisoners.

346
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,810
哎呀不要讓我懷舊了
Don't go getting sentimental on me.

347
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,620
有消息嗎?
What we got?

348
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,800
根據側寫 他在監獄待過
The profile says he's spent time in prison.

349
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,640
他很可能丟了女兒
He probably lost a teenage daughter in a way

350
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,490
孩子失蹤日期 與他綁架殺害受害者的日期有關聯
that corresponds to the dates he abducts and kills his victims.

351
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,210
我們把有疑問的日期分成了4個子集
We have the dates in question divided into 4 specific subsets.

352
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,070
這組是13到16歲的少女 沒有父親監護的
This group is teenage girls age 13 to 16 who were removed from their fathers' care.

353
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,920
這些是同年紀死去的
These are deaths of teenagers the same age.

354
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,930
剩下的是因暴力犯罪被捕的男性
The remainder are men arrested for violet crimes

355
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,610
還有同獄的
and anyone serving a prison sentence during the same window.

356
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,010
這其中肯定有他犯案的導火索
The stressor's in here somewhere.

357
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,740
咱們得找出點靠譜的線索 好據此開始背景調查
Let's find something that looks promising so we can start running background checks.

358
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,050
- Hotchner探員 我是Erin Strauss - 是 長官
- Agent hotchner, erin strauss. - Yes,ma'am.

359
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,490
我打電話來查問下案件的進展
I'm calling to check on the status of your case.

360
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,380
我們正在查一條次要線索
We're pursuing a secondary line of investigation.

361
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,520
- 為什麼會這樣? - 讓我和她說兩句
- And why is that? - Let me talk to her for a second.

362
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,340
請等一下
Hold a moment,please.

363
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,970
長官?
Ma'am?

364
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,630
你覺得我是傻子嗎? Cooper探員
Do you think i'm stupid, agent cooper?

365
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,700
不 長官 我不認為你笨
No,ma'am,uh,i do not think you're stupid.

366
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,370
我給你的指示清楚嗎?
Is it unclear when i give an order?

367
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,350
你應該知道Hotchner探員與這一切無關
You should know that agent hotchner, he had nothing to do with this.

368
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,250
我們需要得到當地的邀請才能介入案件 而你沒有
We need to be invited in by the locals. You weren't.

369
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,670
但你知道我的想法是對的?
You do realize that my theory was right?

370
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,600

這個混蛋拋屍的時候 我怎麼能幹坐在飛機上
And i refuse to be on an airplane while the son of a bitch dumps their bodies.

374

任何觀察都可能有所突破

除非是被逼迫的

我是個不夠格的父親
I haven't been a good enough father.

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,970
你才14歲 你不知道這多可怕
You're 14. You have no idea how terrifying that is.

434
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:42,350

但我不曾是個好的傾聽者
But i haven't been a good listener.

440

我知道你聽得見我

441
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,510
我沒想讓你有所回應
And i'm not asking you to say anything.

442
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:23,170
我只想讓你明白 我 我控制不了所有事情
I just want you to know that i understand that i--that i can't control everything.

443

But as cooper predicted, it is a lengthy tale of woe.

448
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,630
我們要用這個名單 和在 可疑日期死亡的少女的名單比對
We'll use it to cross against the teenage girls who died on some of the dates in question.

Looks like she survived 3 days on life support but eventually died of brain injuries.
