以为你在说飞机的客舱

为什么我们要浪费时间去个破屋

00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:04,083
为什么ben会说
Why would ben say

140
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:07,033
来这里的人是想害我们?
The people coming here intend to do us harm?

141
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:09,097
因为他是个骗子  想吓我们
Because he's a liar and he's trying to scare us.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,087
ben经常这样做
That's what ben does.

143
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:15,060
或者  来这里的人
Or because the people coming here

144
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:17,073
真的是想害我们
Intend to do us harm.

145
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:24,030
你们还有多少支枪
How many guns do you have left?

146
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,047
那是你们直升机上的吗
Hey. is that from your chopper?

147
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:44,047
是的  它是...
Yeah, yeah. that, uh, yeah, they...

148
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,090
我们坠落时为了减轻重量扔的包裹
Reduced the weight load when we started going down.

149
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:51,050
我猜这也是为什么我也被推了出来
Ha ha. I guess that's why they pushed me out.

150
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:54,087
这是干什么的?
What's this for?

151
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,027
我不是负责装备...
I'm not in charge of, uh, packing, so...

152
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,043
你没事吧?
Um... you're not, huh?

153
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:06,067
我们该...  继续前进
We should, uh... you wanna keep moving?

154
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,083
daniel  为什么你们带枪了
Hey, daniel, why did you bring the gun?

155
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:17,003
只是防身之用
Yeah... as a precaution.

156
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,080
防什么?
Precaution against what?

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,050
解救你和你的人...
Rescuing you and your people...

158
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:36,013
不能说是首要任务
Can't really say its our primary objective.

159
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:40,033
那什么是?
then what is?

160
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,097
是miles
it's miles.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,075
是miles  快来
It's miles. come on.

162
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,030
你说你看到了walt是什么意思
What the hell do you mean you saw walt?

163
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,015
梦里吗
 in a dream?

164
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:58,040
不是在梦里  的的确确是walt  只是...
No dream. it was walt. only...

165
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,093
要高一点
taller.

166
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:03,023
高一点?  像个巨人吗?
Taller? what, like a giant?

167
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,080
好吧  那walt到底跟你说了什么
Okay, what exactly did walt tell you?

168
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,040
他说我有工作得完成
He said I had work to do,

169
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,028
那就是得阻止这个女人naomi
That I had to stop this woman, naomi,

170
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,022
把她的其他人带到这里
from bringing the rest of her people here

171
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:16,030
你没问为什么吗
what, you didn't ask any follow-up questions?

172
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,043
Ben给了我一枪然后把我留那等死  
Ben had shot me and left me for dead.

173
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:21,090
Walt救了我,所以我照着他的话去做
walt saved my life, So I pretty much took him at his word.

174
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:25,040
他给了你一枪  你却好好
He shot you, yet here you are,

175
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,074
在森林里活蹦乱跳
Fit as a fiddle, trompin' through the jungle.

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,014
子弹从一边打进去从另一边出来
The bullet went in one side, came out the other.

177
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:45,017
如果我这里还是肾的话我早死了
I'd probably be dead if I still had a kidney there.

178
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,094
还有其他的要问吗
anything else?

179
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,030
在下面
It's down there.

180
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:19,064

183
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:41,090
退后  帅哥

It's okay, miles. they're just trying to help.

00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,060
离他远点儿!  把手放在我能看见的地方
Hey! back away from him! hands where I can see 'em!

188
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:55,077
Kate  没事的

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,034
能告诉我naomi在哪吗
You wanna tell me where naomi is?!

191
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:05,084
什么

192
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:09,007
naomi...  那个你杀了的女人
Naomi-- the woman you killed!

193
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,074
她在哪
where is she?

194
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,097
Gardner女士?
ms. gardner?

195
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:52,057
我是miles straume  我们刚才通过电话
I'm miles straume. we spoke on the phone earlier.

196
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:55,094
请进
Oh. oh, please come in.

197
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,031
哪间房?
Which room is it?

198
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:10,061
在楼上  过道最里面
It's upstairs at the end of the hall.

199
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:14,031
先付钱  200美金  只收现金
I get paid in advance. $200, cash only.

200
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:17,031
-你在电话里是说100美元  -那是我兄弟在警察局
You told me $100 on the phone. that was before my buddy at the police station

201
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:21,001
告诉我你的孙子被杀之前的价格
Told me your grandson was murdered.

202
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:23,011
现在要200美元了
It's gonna be $200.

203
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:25,011
好吧

204
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,051
不管你听见什么
No matter what you hear,

205
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:52,077
都不要上楼来
don't come up.

206
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:35,071
你呆在这里对你祖母
You're not doing your grandmother any good

207
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:37,021
一点好处也没有
Staying here, man.

208
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:40,027
你带给她了很多的痛苦
You're causing her a lot of pain.

209
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:45,054
我...
i...

210
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:48,054
我想下楼并告诉她你已经离开了
I wanna go downstairs and tell her you've gone.

211
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:51,084
但是现在要我这样做的唯一条件
But the only way I'm gonna be able to do that

212
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:55,047
就是你告诉我它在哪里
Is if you tell me where it is.

213
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:01,017
那么它在哪里?
so where is it?

214
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:40,097
你可以走了
you can go now.

215
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:48,061
这奏效了吗?
did it work?

216
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,074
是的 
yeah.

217
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:55,044
他已经安息了
He's at peace now.

218
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:04,011
给
here.

219
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:08,024
退给你点钱  优惠你一半价格
You get a refund, half off.

220
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,027
这没有我想象中那么难
Wasn't as tricky as I thought.

221
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:16,057
谢谢
thank you.

222
00:17:16,064 --> 00:17:18,034
谢谢了

223
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,091
Miles  miles
miles. miles! hey, hey!

224
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:23,064
你干嘛啊?  你要做什么?
What are you doing? what are you doing?

225
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:26,027
-他们是好人  -那为什么Naomi发送那个代码?
These are good people. they why'd naomi use the damn code?

226
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,037
是的  你还记得她说的
Yeah, you remember when she said,

227
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,087
"告诉我妹妹我爱她"?  她根本就没有妹妹
"tell my sister I love her"? well, she doesn't have a sister.

228
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,087
那是当我们在
That's what we're supposed to say

229
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:36,047
被捉住并且有枪指着我们脑袋时候才说的
If we get captured and have a gun to our heads.

230
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:39,051
就好像现在  Jack就应该说
Like right now jack here would say,

231
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:41,084
"告诉我妹妹我爱她"  明白了吗?
"tell my sister I love her." you get it?!

232
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:46,001
-我们没有杀害你的朋友  -那带我去看她的尸体
We didn't kill your friend. then take me to her body.

233
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:50,030
-Miles  那Charlotte还有Frank呢?  -带我去见Naomi!
Miles, what about charlotte? what about frank? take me to naomi!

234
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:52,024
听着  Naomi已经死了  但不是我们干的
Listen, naomi was killed, but not by us.

235
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,094
是...  是个叫John Locke的男人干的
It was--it was a man by the name of john locke.

236
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,009
他现在已经不跟我们在一起了 
He's not with us anymore.

237
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,004
Kate  认真点  如果要我再问一次的话...
kate, seriously, if I have to ask you again--

238
00:17:58,007 --> 00:17:59,037
听着  就算我带你去看她的尸体
Look, even if I took you to her body,

239
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,000
-你还是不会知道发生了什么的  -我会知道的!
You wouldn't know what happened. I'll know!

240
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,033
现在带我过去
Now take me to her body.

241
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,083
alex

-什么事?  -我要告诉你件事
What? something I need to tell you.

244
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:32,044
闭上你的嘴  Mr.Linus
Keep your mouth shut, mr. linus.

245
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:35,054
Karl  如果你要跟我女儿睡的话
Karl. now if you're gonna sleep with my daughter,

246
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:38,007
你还是叫我Ben比较好
I insist you call me ben.

247
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,027
放松点孩子  这个人就是想要激怒你
Easy kid. guy's just trying to get in your head.

248
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,090
去走走或干点别的吧
Go take a walk or somethin'.

249
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:53,057
你介意我问你个问题吗?  James
Mind if I ask you a question, james?

250
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,094
是的  我介意
yeah, i do.

251
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:57,097
你为什么会离开Kate?
Why'd you leave kate behind?

252
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,047
别多费口舌了  Yoda
You're wasting your time, yoda.

253
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,074
我知道这不太令人愉快  但是让我们面对它吧
I know it's not pleasant, but let's face it.

254
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,090
你现在真的没有机会了
You really don't stand a chance now.

255
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,080
什么机会?
chance at what?

256
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:14,015
James  看看你自己
James, look at yourself.

257
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,014
是的  在这个岛上
Yes, on this island,

258
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:17,014
你很勇敢大胆而且帅气
You're brave, daring, handsome.

259
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:18,047
你是个人物
you're someone.

260
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,004
但如果你带他们离开...
But if you left with them...

261
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:24,090
回到现实社会  你这样生活在社会底层的小混混
Back in the real world, a lowlife scam artist like you

262
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:28,094
根本竞争不过一流外科医生的
Could never compete with a first-class surgeon.

263
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:30,097
我觉得当你选择
I think kate was really upset

264
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,050
跟我们一起走  Kate很伤心
When you made your choice to come with us.

265
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,047
多亏了她还有Jack在身边抚慰她
Thank god she has jack there to comfort her--

266
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,014
james! 
james!

267
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:46,007
-不要  -不要干嘛?
Don't. don't what?!

268
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,056
-谁可以告诉我为什么要让这个人活着?
Anyone want to tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?!

269
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,046
我们让他活着
we're keeping him alive

270
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:52,030
是因为他在这个岛上比我们任何人时间都长
Because he's been on this island a lot longer than any of us,

271
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,070
因为他有我们想要的信息
Because he has information we need,

272
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,054
还有除了他的嘴巴
And because apart from his mouth,

273
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,064
他完全不会有危险
He's completely harmless.

274
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:00,011
他的嘴巴刺痛了你的心吗?
His mouth put that hole in your gut?

275
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:04,094
我们解决他吧  就这这里  就现在
Let's--let's execute him right here, right now,

276
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:07,014
在他女儿面前
In front of his daughter.

277
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:29,041
他对我们耍诡计只是时间问题  Johnny
It's only a matter of time before he gets us, johnny.

278
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:31,091
我打赌他已经想好了
And I'll bet he's already figured out

279
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:33,094
下一步怎么对付我们
How he's gonna do it.

280
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:37,087
所以  你来牵着他吧
So you walk him.

281
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:06,054
他在干嘛?
What is he doing?

282
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:09,067
这光线...
the light...

283
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:12,007
有些奇怪  不是吗?
Is strange out here, isn't it?

284
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:14,061
看起来...  看起来好像不是
It's... it's kind of like it doesn't--

285
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,061
分散的不太舒服
It doesn't scatter quite right.  dan? dan?

286
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,017
Dan?
Dan?

287
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,064
你叫Dan  对吗?
Your name's dan, right?

288
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,071
听着  Dan
listen, dan,

289
00:21:27,074 --> 00:21:31,047
我知道你不想任何人受到伤害  对吗?
I know that you don't want anybody to get hurt, right?

290
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:34,054
那你为什么不把那东西放在一边呢?
So why don't you just put that away?

291
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:41,027
因为  Miles...  会杀了我
Because, um, miles... would kill me?

292
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,007
但我们只是想帮帮忙
But we're just trying to help--

293
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,083
Kate  你在浪费时间
Kate, you're wasting your breath.

294
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,069
我们只需静观其变  然后看看会发生什么  好吗?
Let's just let this play out and see what happens, okay?

295
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,003
他们没有杀她
They didn't kill her.

296
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:57,006
他们说的是事实
It happened like they said it did.

297
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,029
是Charlotte
it's charlotte.

298
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:04,056
她就在离这里三公里的地方  好吧  我们去找她
She's only 3 kilometers from here. all right, then. let's go get her.

299
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,016
我说了  我们一起走
I said let's go.

300
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:09,086
-你应该把枪放下  -什么?
You need to put the guns down. what?!

301
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:13,089
-把枪放下  -我为什么要这么做?
Put the guns down. now why would I do that?

302
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:15,049
因为我的朋友们现在就躲在丛林里
Because our friends are out in the jungle right now

303
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,045
把枪对着你还有他的头
Holding a gun at your head and his head.

304
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:20,095
我会不计较刚刚的误会的
So I'm gonna forget about the misunderstanding.

305
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:24,062
-把枪放下  -你当我是白痴啊
Just put the guns down. come on. how stupid do you think i--

306
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:37,099
我不知道  Miles
I don't know, miles.

307
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:41,009
你有多傻
How stupid are you?

308
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,046
在你认为这是真实的之前
How many different languages do you have to read that in

309
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,046
你读过几个语言的版本了
Before you believe it's true?

310
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,033
那么出现过几种不同的语言呢?
How many different languages are there?

311
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:25,036
打扰一下
excusez-moi.

312
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:30,016
他想知道我们是不是迷路了  告诉他我们的工作
He wants to know if we're lost. remind him that people in our line of work

313
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,083
是很危险的  而且要保守秘密
Are terrible at keeping secrets.

314
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:34,023
我知道那个发掘工作的事
I know about the dig.

315
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,063
他说那个地方已经被关闭了
He says the site is closed.

316
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:42,083
那么告诉他打开它
Then tell him to open it.

317
00:23:58,013 --> 00:24:00,073
恐龙?
dinosaur?

318
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:02,066
不是几百万年以前的
Not by a few million years.

319
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,049
这是北极熊
It's an ursus maritimus.

320
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:07,006
等等  "ursus"就是熊的意思?
Wait, "ursus" as in bear?

321
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,009
是北极熊的意思
As in polar bear.

322
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:17,059
Charlotte  我们在沙漠里  这是个骗局  不是吗?
Charlotte, we're in the desert. this is a hoax, right?

323
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:24,046
-她想知道你在用这个锤子干嘛  -在挖掘
He wants to know what you're doing with the hammer. excavating.

324
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,086
这是项圈吗?
Is that a collar?dan?

325
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,092
嗨
hi.

326
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:58,032
你也好
hi yourself.

327
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:08,042
我们在担心你什么时候回来
We were worried when you didn't get back,

328
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:11,042
于是我们回到座舱然后从哪里开始追踪你
So we went out to the cockpit and tracked you from there.

329
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:14,062
-谢谢了 但是很有帮助  -别再提了
Thanks for that, for what it's worth. don't mention it.

330
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:18,046
有人告诉我  calvary就在这里
Somebody could've told me that the calvary were here.

331
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:20,039
我给你了...
I gave you that...

332
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:22,059
一点提示
wink.

333
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:26,046
你们叫什么名字?
What are your names?

334
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:28,093
我叫Daniel Faraday  这位是Miles...
Uh, I'm daniel faraday, and this is miles--

335
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,089
别告诉他我姓什么
Don't tell him my last name.

336
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:33,041
我猜就单Miles
I guess this is just miles.

337
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:36,039
-你是做什么工作的  Daniel?  -我是个物理学家
What do you do for a living, daniel? I'm a physicist.

338
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:38,059
我的意思是  我想你可以叫我物理学家
I mean, I guess you could call me a physicist.

339
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:41,055
-我不喜欢被分到哪一类  -Dan  我向上帝保证
I don't really like being pigeonholed into one-- dan, I swear to god,

340
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:43,075
你再多说一句  我就把你手指弄断
You say one more word, I'm gonna break your fingers.

341
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:46,045
-那你是做什么的  Miles?  -我是收集土壤样本的
And what do you do, miles? I collect soil samples.

342
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:49,029
很不错  你可能可以帮我的忙
Well, that's nice. well, maybe you can help me.

343
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:51,082
你说  你不是营救队伍里的
You say you're not here on a rescue mission,

344
00:26:51,082 --> 00:26:54,086
外面的世界都认为我们已经死了
And the world at large believes us to be dead.

345
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:56,086
但是我们在这里  活着而且还不错
But here we are, alive and well,

346
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:59,069
但你却没有对看见我们感到很奇怪
And you don't seem remotely surprised to see us.

347
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:04,042
天哪  你们是太平洋航空815号航班的幸存者!
Oh, my god. You guys were On oceanic flight 815. Wow!

348
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:06,066

349
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:13,002
难以置信你们居然活下来了
I can't believe You're alive.

350
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:16,045
你们有多少人?
How many of you are there?

351
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:19,078
你问这个干吗?
Why do you wanna know?

352
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:22,022
我为什么不能问?
Why wouldn't i want to know?

353
00:27:25,032 --> 00:27:27,048
48个活下来了
48 of us Survived the crash.

354
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:29,032
这不算尾舱的那些人

-他们现在八成已经死了  -hugo

So you've all been living here This entire time?

357
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,068
那是你孩子吗?

358
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,065
是啊  她叫aaron
Yeah. This is aaron.

359
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:45,048
你在这岛上生的她吗?

360
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:46,078
真了不起

我还有一大堆的问题
Well, i've got about A million more questions

362
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:52,052
想问你们

363
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:54,082
但是得先把你们带回渡轮
But they can wait until we Get you back to the freighter.

364
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:57,049
我们人手一个这种通信器
We've all got One of these transponders,

365
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:00,029
如果我们就在这呆着  他们马上就会来  好吧?
So if we just sit tight, they're Gonna be here soon, okay?

366
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:03,063

你们的直升机怎么了?
And what happened To your helicopter?

369
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:12,006
不知道  驾驶员想降落

00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:16,093
不知道  当时我不得不跳

情况一片混乱

我们得留在这里他们才能找到
We need to stay where we are So that they can find us.

377

See, there's your problem. We don't want to be found.

-先生  能不能请您...  -我现在正盯着电视呢
Sirif you could just tell meLooki'm staring At the television right now.

416

你们在播放机身残骸的画面
You're broadcasting footage Of the wreckage

417
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:36,065
说那是飞行员  seth norris

00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:42,079
请等等
Please hold.

421
00:31:42,082 --> 00:31:45,012
请问阁下是哪位?

422
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,015
我是谁不重要  你们在播放
Doesn't matter who i am. You're showing footage

423
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,099
seth norris的画面  但那不是他
Of seth norris, And that's not him.

424
00:31:49,002 --> 00:31:51,072
听着  这家伙19岁就跟他的高中小甜心结婚了
Listen, this guy married his High school sweetheart at 19.

425
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,039
他一直戴着他的结婚戒指的  告诉你
He always wore his wedding ring. And i'm telling you,

426
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:57,089
-那尸体手上没有戒指  -先生  很可能是坠机时...
There's no ring on that body.Sir, it's likely The ring fell off when--

427
00:31:57,092 --> 00:32:00,039
告诉你  那不是他

那请问究竟
And how exactly is it

429
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:05,079
你有多了解norris上尉
That you know all about Captain norris?

430
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:10,015
因为那天本应是我驾驶开太平洋815航班的
Because i was supposed to be Flying oceanic 815 on that day.

431
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:35,019
是他们
That's them.

432
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:38,042
我的同队队员
That's somebody From my team.

433
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:45,015
你们干嘛?  我们来这都是为了你们
What's wrong with you people? We're here because of you.

434
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:47,032
我从直升机上跳下差点摔死
I just almost died Jumping out of a helicopter

435
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:49,085
就是因为你们给我们打了求救电话
Because you called us For help.

436
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,023
也许我们该去看看是谁发的信号
Maybe we should go see Who launched that flair.

437
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:55,036
-我是说  他们可能受伤了  john  -她在撒谎
Yeah, i mean,They could be hurt, john.She's lying.

438
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,013
而且无论如何他们来并不是为了我们
And whatever they came for,It isn't us.

439
00:33:58,013 --> 00:33:59,083
-我们按原计划一直向前走  -是啊
We keep moving forward As planned.sure.

440
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:02,019
-谁叫你是那个跟高个儿walt的鬼魂谈话的人呢?
Who are we to argue With taller ghost walt? You know what?

我不是在求你们同意
I'm not asking for permission.

443
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:09,049
如果你觉得你们能拦住我不去...
And if you think you're gonna bloody stop me From getting to my--

444
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:19,063

453
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,046
出什么事了?

00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,086
我们被闪电击中了
We got struck by lightning.

455

frank  charlotte呢?
Frank, where's charlotte?

456
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:09,053
她在坠机前跳伞了
She bailed out just b-before We went down.

457
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:12,053
不知道她在哪儿  直升机在哪?
I don't know where she is. Where's the chopper?

458
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:14,093
我看到一头奶牛
I saw a cow.

459
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,069
Hey. Hey.

460
00:35:18,023 --> 00:35:20,086
lapidus  直升机呢?  坠毁在哪儿了?
Lapidus, where's the chopper? Where did it crash?

461
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:23,083
坠毁?  你当我是菜鸟?
Crash? The hell kind of pilot You think i am?

462
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:27,040
我把她停在那了  完好无损  
I put her down safe and sound Right over there.

463
00:35:56,063 --> 00:35:58,060
这就是队员们?
so this is the team?

464
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:02,060
-你看过他们的资料了?  -是啊  真遗憾  
you've familiarized Yourself with their profiles? Unfortunately, yes.

465
00:36:02,063 --> 00:36:03,083
客气的说
With respect,

466
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:05,083
这些人不适合这种任务
These are the wrong people For a mission like this.

467
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,083
都没有野外生存的经验
None of them have Field experience,

468
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,013
没有参加过军事训练

469
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:11,029
你不能就把他们往那里一扔
You can't just Drop them in unprotected.

470
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:14,079
-会很糟糕的  -他们并非没有受到保护  他们有你
It'll be a disaster. They're not unprotected. They have you.

471
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:17,086
我能做多少呢
there's only So much i can do.

472
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:21,066
你的谦逊就是最有用的
Your modesty Is positively charming.

473
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:25,053
这个任务十分机密  风险也大
This is a high-risk covert op In unstable territory.

474
00:36:25,053 --> 00:36:27,087
没人监管会非常危险
It's dodgy enough Without having to babysit

475
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:30,057
一个疯子  一个驱鬼者  一个人类学家和一个酒鬼
A head case, ghostbuster, Anthropologist and a drunk.

476
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:32,051
公平的说  他也是个优秀的飞行员
To be fair, he's also A pretty good pilot.

477
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:35,081
这太疯狂了  要是我们找到815航班的幸存者怎么办?
It's madness. What if We find survivors from 815?

478
00:36:35,084 --> 00:36:37,068
没有幸存者
There were no survivors.

479
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:40,058
是的  我知道  但是如果有呢?
Yes, i know. But what if There are survivors?

480
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:44,018
没有太平洋航空815航班的幸存者
There were nosurvivors Of oceanic 815.

481
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:47,031
别问问题  做你该做的
Don't ask questions. Just do What you were hired for.

482
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:48,095
这个队里的每个成员
Every member of this team

483
00:36:48,095 --> 00:36:50,092
都是精挑细选的
Was selected For a specific purpose.

484
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:52,039
都得靠你了
Everything relies on you

485
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:54,039
把他们带过去  也要带回来
Getting them in,Getting them out

486
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:56,055
别让他们中的任何人死掉
And preventing anyone From getting killed.

487
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:59,019
能做到吗?
Think you can do that?

488
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,039
能
Sure.

489
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:04,009
怎么不能?
Why not?

490
00:37:25,015 --> 00:37:27,009
有点小损伤
There's some minor damage,

491
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:29,079
整个机械系统还是完整的
But the mechanical systems Are intact.

492
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,029
就是说它还能飞?
So it'll fly, then?

493
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:32,065
肯定
Absolutely.

494
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:36,025
我现在能用电话吗?
Can i have the phone now?

495
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:39,025
跟你直说了  告诉我你们来这里干什么

00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:46,029
你把电话给我 我就告诉你我们来这里干什么
I'll tell you. What we're doing here If you give me the phone.

498
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:51,075
别提你姐姐的事
Don't say anything About your sister.

499
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,052

minkowski现在接不了
Minkowski can't Come to the phone right now.

502
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:03,085
事关重大  去叫他
It's important. Go get him.

503
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:07,049
miles  他现在接不了

505
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:11,065
我得挂了

506
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:16,039
你们干什么?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing with her?

507
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:18,016
我们带她一起走
We're taking her with us.

508
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:20,069
为什么?  那不是naomi  一堆肉而已
What's the point? That's--that's Not naomi. It's just meat.

509
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:22,079
mils  我们不能把她丢在这里
Miles, we can't just Leave her here.

510
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:26,022
miles说的对  躲避那该死的风暴
Miles is right. We burned up Most of the damn fuel

511
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:28,022
把燃料都耗光了
Flying around in that storm.

512
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:31,039
我们要回到渡轮那里已经很勉强
We barely got enough To get back to the freighter.

513
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,089
所以不带任何多余的东西

-能不能去拿来?  -好的
Would you grab it?Yeah.

517
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,043
看起来跟感觉一样糟糕吧?

00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:49,063
感觉怎样?

-你还好吧  -我觉得胸口压着块渣煤砖  
You okay? I feel like I've got a cinder block on my chest,

543
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:58,032
-但没什么大碍  -对于你中枪我很抱歉  
But I'll survive. I'm sorry you got shot.

544
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:00,082
我没想到会这样  -是吗？
I didn't intend for that to happen. really?

545
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:03,088
好像是你要朝我开枪的
