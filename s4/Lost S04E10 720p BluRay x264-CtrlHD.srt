你的态度  你糟糕的态度
Your--your attitude-- your very bad attitude--

126
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:57,048
正是这样他们才不信任我们
It's exactly why they don't trust us.

127
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,032
别这样了

00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,040
我需要一块干净的地方
We need to create a sterile environment.

136
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,027
找一块硬地  洗干净
Find a hard surface, wash it down,

137
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:30,075
尽量找到更多的防水布
Gather as many tarps as you can.

138
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,033
嘿  Juliet
Hey, juliet.

139
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:37,021
如果医疗救护站有我们需要的任何东西
If everything that we need is at the medical station,

140
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,005
-那我们为何不把Jack直接带到那去  -因为如果我们移动他   
-Then why don't we just bring jack there? -Because if we move him,

141
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:41,096
他的阑尾可能就因此破裂
There's a good chance that his appendix will rupture.

142
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,089
还有如果真这样了  他就会死
And if that happens, he's gonna die.

143
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,056
想都别想
Don't even think about it.

144
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:04,028
什么
What?

145
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:09,037
不准看她  不准和她说话
Don't look at her. Don't talk to her.

146
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,051
不准打扰她
Don't mess with her.

147
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:15,087
给你下禁令  离她20英尺远
You got a restraining order. 20 feet.

148
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,079
你是谁  她大哥哥?
What are you, her big brother?

149
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:21,097
不是  我是要狠狠揍你的人
No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face

150
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,041
除非你说  是的  我知道了
Unless you say, "yeah. I getcha."

151
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:25,018
是的  我知道了
Yeah. I getcha.

152
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,026
亲爱的  我相信Jack不会有事的 
Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay.

153
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,053
阑尾切除术
An appendectomy

154
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:45,048
是一种最常见的手术
Is just about the most common kind of surgery there is.

155
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,021
我不是在想这个
That's not what I was thinking about.

156
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:50,011
我在想  他怎么就生病了
I was thinking, "why did he get sick?"

157
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:52,038
怎么?  只是  只是运气不好罢了
Why? It's just-- it's just bad luck.

158
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,094
就在我们都以为要获救的时候
The day before we're all supposed to be rescued,

159
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,069
我们最依赖的人
The person that we count on the most

160
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,085
却突然陷入了生命危险
Suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition,

161
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:00,099
-而你却把这归因于运气不好?  -那你是说
-And you're chalking it up to bad luck? -Well, what are you saying,

162
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,075
难道Jack做了一些冒犯上帝的事
That--that Jack did something to offend the gods?

163
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:08,031
-人们生病了  Rose  -不是在这
People get sick, Rose. -Not here.

164
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:12,031
在这里  他们都更好了
Here, they get better.

165
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:24,084
你最后一次这样做是什么时候
When was the last time you did this?

166
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:27,071
你说的是阑尾切除术还是给男人刮肚子?
An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach?

167
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:32,080
在我的住处
In my residency.

168
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,031
我做过很多这样的手术
I did a lot of 'em back then.

169
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,001
那你应该知道切口在
Then you know the incision needs to be

170
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,018
你刮的地方往下2英寸
2 inches lower than where you're shaving.

171
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:46,042
我只是在清洗这块
I'm just cleaning the area.

172
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,046
谢谢你
Thank you.

173
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,097
我想跟你谈谈
I wanna talk you through it.

174
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,006
什么?
What?

175
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:59,018
我不想失去意识
I don't want to be unconscious.

176
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:01,035
我们可以用利多卡因(一种局部麻醉剂)
We can use the lidocaine

177
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:06,020
这样我就能看到手术过程
And then I can watch the procedure,

178
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:08,001
帮助你
Help you out.

179
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:11,004
你躺平了我手又在腹腔
And, uh, how are you gonna watch

180
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:14,028
你怎么能够看到
Flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity?

181
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:17,086
我们可以用镜子  Kate来拿
We can use a mirror. kate can hold it.

182
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,062
如果需要人的话
If someone's going to be in there,

183
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:27,003
难道不应该是有手术经验的人吗?
Shouldn't it be someone with medical experience?

184
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:28,090
-Bernard医生  -不  我希望Kate在这
-Bernard's a dentist-- -No, I want it to be kate.

185
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:40,089
别担心  Berenberg小姐  你的状态很好
Don't worry, Ms. berenberg. You're in good hands.

186
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,084
-那明天早上5点见  -好的
-I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? -Mm-hmm.

187
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:47,005
记住  不要吃太硬的食物  好吗
And remember, no solid food. okay?

188
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:48,040
-谢谢  医生  -祝你晚上愉快  
-Thank you, doctor. -Have a good evening.

189
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,076
你看一下这张X射线图?
Will you take a look at this x-ray?

190
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:03,068
是14号的  我想知道你的看法  L4号  好的
-Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think. -The L4. yeah. yeah.

191
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:06,032
Shephard医生  有你的电话
Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you.

192
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:09,000
是Stillman从Santa rosa医院打来的
It's a dr. stillman from Santa rosa hospital,

193
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,070
说是有关你一个朋友的

他拒绝服药

196
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:18,093
他的治疗方案进展如何?
What about his therapy sessions?

197
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,097
治疗毫无效果
Therapy's... been rendered useless.

198
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:25,053
为何会这样呢?
And why is that?

199
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:28,086
因为他认为我不存在
Because he doesn't think I exist.

200
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,004
你为什么不吃药呢
Why aren't you taking your meds?

201
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,011
因为我们快死了
Cause we're dead...

202
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,017
我们所有人
All of us.

203
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:03,038
大洋航班六人  都要死了
All the oceanic six-- we're all dead.

204
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,039
我们从未离开过那岛

205
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,026
Hurley
Hurley...

206
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,000
不是那样的
That is not true.

207
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:15,006
我今天干了什么
What did I do today?

208
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,036
我...
I, uh...

209
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:21,000
起床后  洗了个澡
I woke up, took a shower.

210
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:24,029
我和Kate一起喂孩子吃饭

211
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:27,085
我还以为你不想和Aaron扯上关系
I thought you didn't want anything to do with aaron.

212
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,031
审讯过后我改变注意了
I changed my mind after the trial.

213
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,017
和Kate生活在一起
Living with kate...

214
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:36,063
照顾Aaron
Taking care of aaron...

215
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,024
一切都那么幸福完美
It all seems so perfect...

216
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,047
就像是在天堂
Just like heaven.

217
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,080
不能因为我很幸福
Just because I'm happy

218
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:47,058
就说这不是真的  Hurley
Doesn't mean that this isn't real, hurley.

219
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:49,018
不管怎样  我也曾经幸福过  Jack
I was happy, too, jack...

220
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:52,031
虽然只有那么一会儿
For a while, anyway.

221
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,002
后来我遇见了Charlie
Then I saw charlie.

222
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:02,082
他喜欢和我一起坐在长椅上
He likes to sit with me on the bench

223
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:04,031
坐在草坪上
Out on the front lawn.

224
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:07,024
真的很酷
It's pretty cool, actually.

225
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,067
很好啊  那么你们俩都说些什么呢
Okay.  so what do the two of you talk about?

226
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,058
昨天他告诉我你要来看我
Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by.

227
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,034
他叫我给你捎个信
He wanted me to give you a message.

228
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:31,079
他叫我写下来了  这样我就不会搞砸
He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up.

229
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:38,032
"你不该抚养他  Jack"
"you're not supposed to raise him, jack."

230
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:42,063
这消息有什么意思吗?
Does that make any sense?

231
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:47,017
不  这...毫无道理
No, that... doesn't make any sense.

232
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:49,020
你认为他说的是Aaron吗?
Do you think he means aaron?

233
00:17:58,046 --> 00:17:59,084
吃药  Hurley
Take your meds, hurley.

234
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:05,013
嘿  Jack
Hey, jack?

235
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,026

她知道他喜欢她吗

243

她是个女人  知道的
She's a woman. She knows.

244
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,027
Jin 走吧

245
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:14,063
你认为这电是哪来的
Where do you suppose all this power's coming from?

246
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,058
把这个记下来  Dan
Add that one to the list, dan.

247
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,011
我们去搬设备  然后走人  好吗
Let's just grab the equipment and go, shall we?

248
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,025
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

249
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:29,081
Juliet就是把我带在这的
This is where Juliet brought me.

250

我们的孩子当时就在这里

他们没打算帮助我们  Jin
They're not going to help us, Jin.

252

Jeez, man, he looks bad. what the hell happened?

272
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,091
少管闲事  是我们自己的事
You do your job. I'll do mine.

273
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,015
天快黑了  伙计

274

我们得马上离开

Keamy, we gotta get back, cause I'll tell ya right now,

277
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,014
在晚上我可找不准法拉第方位
I am not flying faraday's bearings at night.

278
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:34,020
如果你还想回去  得马上离开  先生

285
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,046
我这里还需要一个人帮忙
Listen, I could use an extra pair of hands in there.

286
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:02,057
-你可以帮我吗? -我...我想还是不要了
You wanna help me out? um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.

287
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,093
只不过是举个镜子
It's just holding a mirror.

288
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:06,043
Jack想看手术  "跟我说话"
Jack wants to watch the surgery, "talk me through it."

289
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,016

290
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,001
只是有点吃惊
I'm just surprised

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,054
他怎么不现在就把那东西弄出来
He's not taking it out of himself by now.

292
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:18,065
你在干吗?
What are you doin'?

293
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,068
-不用拐杖我也可以走上50英尺 -我来扶你
I don't need a stretcher. I can walk 50 feet. I'll help you.

294
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:24,097
他们很快就会带着器具回来了
They're gonna be back with the instruments soon.

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,091
他们一回来我们就开始手术
We need to be ready to go as soon as they get back.

296
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,093
貌似我要做你的护士了
So it looks like I'm gonna be your nurse.

297

怎么啦?  出什么事了?
What's going on? what's wrong?

310

我给Aaron读故事的那天晚上

Nothing. I just...

409
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:01,085
从没听你说起过
Never heard you mention her before.

410
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,040
那么现在你听到了
Well, now you have.

411
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:08,068
楼上见
I'll see you upstairs.

412
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:20,073
老爸?
Dad?

413
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:31,006
嘿
Hey.

414
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:38,095
她表现的不错
She did good.

415
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:43,028
她说你要是愿意可以进去
She said you could go back inside if you want to.

416
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:46,027
谢谢
Thank you.

417
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:47,021
好
Okay.

418
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:05,053
他没流太多血
He didn't lose that much blood.

419
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,082
我想我取出了阑尾
I got the appendix out

420
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:10,049
然后把一切归位
And put everything back where it belongs, I think.

421
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:14,006
那他没事了?
So he's gonna be okay?

422
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,059
他会好的
He should be fine.

423
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,075
我们还得说服他休息
We just have to talk him into resting.

424
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:20,030
希望我们好运
Good luck with that.

425
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:23,071
很抱歉我朝你大喊大叫
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

426
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:25,086
没关系
Don't worry about it.

427
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:27,067
你受的苦够多了
You had enough going on.

428
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:35,020
你知道  他亲了我
You know, he kissed me.

429
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:37,034
什么?
What?

430
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,016
那天  你从岛的另一边
The other day, when you came back

431
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:42,009
回来  Jack亲了我
From the other side of the island, Jack kissed me.

432
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,071
但那吻却不是给我的  是为他自己
But it wasn't for me. it was for him.

433
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:55,043
我坚信他是试着要证明些什么
I'm pretty sure he was trying to prove something.

434
00:35:57,013 --> 00:35:58,000
什么?
Prove what?

435
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:03,049
他不爱别人
That he doesn't love someone else.

436
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,093
谢谢你  Juliet
Thank you, Juliet.

437
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:22,031
谢谢你救了他
Thank you for saving his life.

438
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:36,088
我知道你醒着

439
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:57,089
你提早回来了
You're home early.

440
00:36:58,088 --> 00:36:59,059
Veronica人呢?
Where's Veronica?

441
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,069
我打发她回家了

442
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:03,008
孩子睡了
The baby's asleep.

443
00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:10,055
她为什么来这?
Why was she here?

444
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:16,007
什么?
Sorry?

445
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:19,038

我是六点到家的

有些事要办  所以...

我要求她多留几个小时的
I asked her to stay a couple extra hours.

450
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:36,012
怎么了  Jack?
What's going on, Jack?

451
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,029
你怎么回来的那么早?
Why are you home so early?

452
