Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

今天早上我看到她 牵着它在公园散步

Wait, she was walking the bike?

I told you not to get involved with your assistant.

There's no such thing as a secret when it comes to affairs.
只要是地下情 绝对是纸包不住火的

152
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,160

Maybe it's not that bad. They might not take it the way I meant it.
或许没有那么糟糕 他们可能看不懂我的意思

156
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,280

对不起，我帮不了你 看到了没？规定就是规定

I told them your candy was absolutely indescribable.
我告诉他们你的糖果 真的是好吃到无法形容

有人说它是“天上 掉下来的礼物”，但那不重要

她不是住在你楼下 做爱时会大叫的那个女人吗？

173
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,640
All right, I'll do it just this once.
好吧，我只破例一次

174

-Thank you. -Unbelievable!

I can't believe that sign didn't work.

181
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,990
Maybe.

或许我们该换个飞机座椅 或懒骨头

I would ring the bell to distract him.

然后我会用中国的飞镖 把那个家伙敲昏

213
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,260

and never playing it.
