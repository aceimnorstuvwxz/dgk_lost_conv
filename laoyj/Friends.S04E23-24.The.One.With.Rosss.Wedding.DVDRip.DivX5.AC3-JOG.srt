Man,you are Westminster Crabby.

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,090
I'm bummed the way I left things with Ross.
我应付罗斯的方式真差劲

142
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,390
I wish I didn't lie about work. He seemed so mad at me.
真后悔骗他说我要工作 他好像很气我

143
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,330
Don't be so hard on yourself. If I was still in love with some

Yeah,me neither.
很好，我也没有

149

...and that would be uncomfortable.

150
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,420
Not because I'm in love with him. I like Ross as much as anyone.
不是因为我还爱他 我跟大家一样喜欢罗斯

我对他的确有感情 但那不是爱

I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.
我对他还有“性”趣 但我当然爱他

156
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,740

Why didn't you tell me?

-We thought you knew! -We?

We thought you knew. It's so obvious!

164

It would be like telling Monica:

165
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,270
"Hey,you like things clean."
“喂，你很爱干净喔”

我不必买印着 “与笨蛋同行”的衣服了

Well,I like it. Here you go.

You're not really buying that. Haven't you embarrassed me enough?

Oh,I embarrass you?

是吗？那这里怎么没人戴？

179
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,900
They're all tourists.

180
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,000
If you insist on wearing that in public...

...and she suggested we put the wedding off for a bit.

192
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,830
She said what?

This isn't right.

I realize that people are gonna be disappointed.

But I'm sure they'll come back.

Don't you point your pants at me!

你不懂吗？这是我们的婚礼

我只知道延期是不可能的 要结就现在结

What is wrong with these pants?
这条裤子是怎么搞的？

212

不是裤子，是你本末倒置

...跟墓地的土装在一起 挂在面北的树上？

Only if you have the hiccups too.
要是你也在打嗝的话

226
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,460
The chocolate and water are for me. I didn't feel like getting up.
照片是给你的，其他是我要的 我只是不想起来

227

I'll show you a picture of Ross.

I did that while we were going out.
我们交往时我就这样

Before we start,I want to say, for the record,I love Ross.

I don't know.
我不晓得 

240
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,510
His hair never bothered me that much.
他的头发没那么困扰我

241
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,550
It was more crunchy than it was greasy.

242
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,420
This will be harder than I thought.
好吧，难度比我想的还高

Let's try some aversion therapy.

Sorry.

That wasn't cool.
那样很过份

既然你这么会解决问题 问题来了

274
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,130
