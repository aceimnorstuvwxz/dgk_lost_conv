我想说也没办法说 因为我不知道

126
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,920
I swear I didn't see anything! I don't want to know. It was just a momentary lapse.
我发誓我什么都没看到，我不想知道 刚刚我是一时糊涂

127
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,280
Momentary lapse? Don't you have any self-control?
一时糊涂？ 你不懂得自制吗？

128
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,860
Okay. A couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
好吧，现在跟我说教 已经迟了好几个月，罗斯

129
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,770
Hello?
哈

130
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,960
I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
我在浴室，你能进来一下吗？ 我觉得不太对劲

-怎么了？ -我自己放洗澡水，但我没有弄对

134
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,350
The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve and is now lodged places.
水温温的，浴盐无法溶解 现在它们结块了

135
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,490
And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile?
我用的香味闻起来很不协调 尤加利树跟甘菊？

136
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,230
-What? -Bath salts.

00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,740
Okay. Let's talk about something else.
好吧，我们谈谈别的事

I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey.

-我也跟他谈过 -是吗？他到底在说什么？

That was a long night.
那是漫长的一夜

好吧，我们来谈谈这件事 他到底跟你说了什么？

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,340
He was talking about rules and looking at people differently.
他说到规则 对别人有不同的看法

-He didn't say that to me. -What'd he tell you?
-他没有跟我说那个 -他跟你说了什么？

He was asking questions about you, me and London.

或许他想跟某人 发生你跟我在伦敦发生的事

155
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,130
But what'd he mean by "rules"?
但他说“规则”是什么意思？

156
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,140
Wait. He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in.
等一下，菲比走进来时 他就不说了

157
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,500
-Because he was looking at her differently. -And Phoebe is his friend.
-因为他用不同的眼光看她 -菲比是他的朋友

So he thinks that would be breaking the rules.

Why would I say anything?

164
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,160
They would have me to thank. Then we could all start having babies!
他们会谢谢我 然后我们可以开始做宝宝

165
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,540

如果你生了儿子 你可以帮他取名字
