-你不用帮忙吗？ -我有试过…

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,140
but apparently singing "I Will Survive" in a helium voice, not helping.
但是很明显地，用假音唱 “我会活下去”并没有帮助

5

- Hey, guys. - Hey.

-这位是莫莉，莫莉，钱德，乔伊 -嗨

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,600
Somebody's getting a little fussy.
有人有点不高兴喔

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,240
You're damn right I am. I've been waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.
你说的没错，我就是不高兴 我已经等饼干等了七分钟了

-什么？你真的觉得她很辣吗？ -你看不出来吗？

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,890
If I wasn't married, she'd be rejecting me right now.
如果我未婚，她现在就在拒绝我了

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,320
Joey?

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,330
How do you think she's doing?
觉得她的姿势怎样？

Now that Rachel's gone?

So hot, I cried myself to sleep last night.

26
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,853

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,130
Hey, Mike, what's the capital of Peru?

- Lima. - No.

It starts with a V and ends with an X.

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,950
And hopefully with a T-O in the middle.
然后最好中间有T跟O

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,850
You know, come to think of it, the capital of Peru is "Vtox."
我仔细想想之后，我想秘鲁的首都 应该叫做“VTOX”

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,560
- Oh, God! - What?
-喔，天啊！ -怎么了？

Well, he's your pet rat?

不太算是，只是偶尔会来拜访 

38
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,870
who I put food out for. Kind of like Santa.
我有时候会喂他 有点像圣诞老公公

Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
除了圣诞老公公 不会在饼干盘里便便以外

41
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,590
You can't keep a rat in your apartment. They're unsanitary.
你不能在公寓里养老鼠 那很不卫生的

42
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,750
I mean, they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
我是说，他们可能会 传染细螺旋体病或是汉他病毒

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,480
- What are those? - I don't know..
-那是什么？ -我不知道

44
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,130
but they don't sound like spa treatments.
但是听起来可不像是水疗吧

45
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,820
- You have to get rid of it. - Okay, fine.
-你必须要处理掉他 -好啦

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,290
If it means that much to you, I'll get rid of Bob.

Thank you.

真奇怪，你觉得他很恶心 却又在吃他的饼干

不，我是说第一印象 通常不是很重要的

我很抱歉，很明显地，海瑟的屁股 有更重要的事要对你说

so I'll just wait till it's finished.

- What? - I was giving you an apology..

64
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,320
and you were totally checking her out.
而你一直在打量她

65
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,490
I wasn't. I'm in fashion. I was looking at her skirt.
我没有，我是在时装业工作 我只是在看她的裙子

还是裤子呢？我并没有看清楚 屁股以下的部位

I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate. Okay?
