我只是说他这次不会翻身

282
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,940

What did you do to them?

There's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.
这么说吧，在俄亥俄州 有一伙打扮亮丽的狗

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,390

Chandler's here. He was wondering if

I guess he ran out of change.
我想他零钱正好用完了

或许你应该寄点东西给他 等他到了赌城 就知道你想表达歉意了

337
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,230
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn?
好主意，上哪儿找一堆A片？

338
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,890
No,don't say, "I'm sorry," with porn.
不行，不能用A片道歉啦 真的？

339
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,570
You should send him a carton of cigarettes.
你应该寄一条烟过去 

340

Because that way he can trade it for protection.

No. That's prison.

I know how we're gonna figure this out.

Phoebe,you and l have never played chess.
菲比，我和你没下过西洋棋

然后你脱下面具 变成了卡麦蓉狄亚

There's a chance this may have been a dream.
好吧，这有可能是梦境

所以你这阵子以来对我不爽 全是因为一场梦？
