但我不是那种随便的女孩 为了工作就能出卖肉体

173
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,710
Even though I kissed you, that does not give you...
听我说！ …虽然我亲过你

174
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,720
...the right to demand sex from me! I do not want this job that bad.
你也没有权利要我跟你上床 这份工作我也没有那么想要

176
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,820
Good day,sir.
再会

You are not gonna believe...

We're not supposed to do that.

186

What could happen? I mean

Yeah. I'm gonna say no.
我看答案是不行

-Do you want to see a movie tonight? -We can't. We already have plans.
菲比，晚餐后要去看电影吗？ 不行，我们已经有计划了

What are you doing?
你们要去干嘛？

就跟每天一样啊 腻在盖瑞的公寓里

But have fun at the movie.

Well,we're not seeing a movie.
我们不是要去看电影

195
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,570
Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
那你干嘛问我们要不要去？

196
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,810
Because I just wanted to know what you were doing...
我是怕你...

197
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,040
...so you wouldn't walk in on me and Chandler...
...不小心冲进我房间 

198
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,310
...while we were doing it all night.
因为我和钱德会做上一整晚

199
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,750
Will you excuse me?
失陪一下

Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
钱德，方便私下说几句话吗？

-We have got to beat them! -Why?
我们一定要打败他们 为什么？

202

So we've gotta go have a lot of sex and prove them wrong!
所以我们上楼去大干一场 证明他们是错的

206
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,410
You've got to stop this competitive thing. It's crazy.
摩妮卡，你别再比来比去 这真是疯了

207
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,710
Just to impress them,you want us to have sex over and over...
只为了让盖瑞和菲比难看 我们就要上楼大战数十回合

208
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,890
...and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat!
你知道我的答案吗？ 快去拿外套

209
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,655

Excuse me.
借过

211
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,706
“警告：有人侵入本大楼 发现这名变态请报警”

212
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,670
You should check this out. Tell the other tenants.
你们应该看一看 通知其他的住户

我知道，你就是那个 不愿意分担工友欢送费的人

217
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,260
Never mind.

218
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,730
I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.
其实我觉得大家的反应不公平 

219
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,910
I mean,you had just moved in.

What you been doing?

It's impossible to find her apartment!

She lives in some hot-girl parallel universe or something.

她明明就住在二楼 左边数过来第七间

250
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,880
No,she lives on the 3rd floor, 8th apartment from the left.
非也… 她住在三楼 左边数过来第八间

252
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,380
No. Those first two windows, that's the lobby.
才怪，前两个窗户是大厅的

253
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,040
That other window is the stairway. You've been counting wrong.

I did not know that! Thank you,Monica.

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,720
First,I would like to say thank you for seeing me again.
首先我要谢谢你 同意再次见我

263
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,120
That's all right.
不要紧

264
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,800
But I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
但我有义务告诉你 这次的面试有录影存证

265
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,770
Well,first,I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you...
好，首先我要向你道歉 我不小心亲了你

266
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,070

267
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,880

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,240
Now,you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not...

...yell at you and storm out.

不过那样可就错大了 原因是这样的

272
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,660
I made a huge fool of myself, and I came back. That shows courage.
我大出洋相之后还敢回来 这显示我有勇气

273
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,320
When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job,I said no.
我以为你要我用性来交换工作 当时我拒绝了

274
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,090

277
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,240
Now,I know that I've already said courage...

278
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,850
...but you've got to have courage.

279
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,920
And finally,when I thought you were making sexual advances...
最后当我以为你 想趁工作之便孜冶阋

280
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
...I said no, and I was not litigious.

I may regret this...

But come on,this is getting ridiculous.

Come on,we can't let them win!
别这样，我们不能让他们赢

..."can't keep their hands off each other" phase!

Oh,is that what this has all been about?

Yeah,that was great. That was really great.
那时很棒，真的很棒
