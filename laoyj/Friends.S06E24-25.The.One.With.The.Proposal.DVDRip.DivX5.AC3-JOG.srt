-见到你真好 -彼此彼此，你把头发留长了

-你又开始留胡子了 -我的鼻子感到寂寞

Chandler. I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.

你在想什么？ 我不知道这是拍卖会

我以为是猜一猜 帮助慈善团体，免费得帆船

I don't know. Charity?

Well,just buy the damn boat.

So we're hiding in the bathroom...

Let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures.

没错，但是她忙着打水球仗

当我看到她跟朋友横冲直撞 我觉得我好像保姆

Weigh the good stuff about her against the bad.
你可以比较这段感情的利弊

And the sex is probably great, huh?

如果你是指很温柔又互相尊重

Some friends make a deal.
有些人不是会跟朋友约定

458

469
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,040
Oh, seriously?
是吗？

470
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,540
I think his exact words were..
对，他说的是…

471
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,240
Charming.
真迷人

472
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,090
He's just a backup.
只是个备胎

473
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,030
-Hey,Monica. -Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
-摩妮卡 -你有见到瑞秋吗？或是镜子？

475
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,340
-It's for my boat. Pretty cool,huh? -Yeah,it's great.
-这是我的船长装，酷吧？ -很酷

476
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,060
What's wrong? Talk to the captain.
怎么了？告诉船长

478
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,480
Just realizing I'm in a dead-end relationship.
我又发现这段感情是死路一条

479
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,580
-Chandler being difficult? -I don't want marriage tomorrow.
钱德欺负你是吧？ 我又不是明天就要结婚

481
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,240
But I wanna know we're going somewhere, that I'm not wasting time.
我只是想知道 我不是在原地打转，浪费时间

482
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,480
-You know Chandler. -No,I don't know Chandler.
你也了解钱德  我已经不了解钱德了

484
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,920
Not anymore. It's like something's changed.
仿佛有什么事变了

485
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,660
-Maybe you changed. -I didn't change.
也许是你变了？ 我才没变

487
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,830
Maybe that's the problem.
也许问题就在这里

488
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,400
-What? -Chandler is a complex fellow.
什么？ 钱德很复杂

490
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,300
One who is unlikely to take a wife.
不太可能成亲

491
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,880
Is that some kind of boat talk?
这是跑船人的用语吗？

492
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:52,050
I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
我还没想好在船上的说话风格

493
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,450
Does he think I'll wait around for nothing?
他以为我会空等下去吗？

494
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,820
Face it. Chandler is against marriage.
面对现实吧，钱德反对婚姻 

495
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,890
And always will be.
他是不会变了

496
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,030
There's some people who do wanna marry me.
有些人可是真心想娶我

497
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,530
-There are? -Yeah. Richard.
有吗？ 有，理查

499
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,900
Richard said he wants to marry you?
理查说他想娶你？

500
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,410
-And Chandler says he hates marriage? -That's right.
钱德说他痛恨婚姻？ 没错

501
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,480
Chandler loves marriage!

502
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,880
You just said he hates marriage!
你刚才说他痛恨婚姻

503
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,640
"He's a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife"!
说他很复杂，不太可能娶妻

504
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,980
"He's against marriage and always will be"!
说他会永远反对婚姻

505
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,630
You got that from what I said?
你的解读是这样？

506
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,960
After the Cretaceous Period, the dinosaurs were gone.
白垩纪结束，恐龙也从此绝迹

507
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,000
What happened,you guys?
你们究竟怎么了？

508
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,510
-Rach. -Hey,you.
瑞秋 帅哥

509
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,780
-Come on in. -Thank you.
请进 谢谢

510
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,310
I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
很遗撼你跟伊丽莎白分手了

511
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,620

谢谢，我以为我们能克服万难 

512
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,990
I guess it wasn't meant to be.
这大概是命中注定的

513
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,600
Yeah. Love. It's a tricky business,isn't it?
是啊，爱情…爱情真是微妙

514
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,660
-I guess so. -So,what do you say we make a pact?
是啊  我们要不要来做个约定

516
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,330
If you and I are both single by 40, we get married.
要是我们到了40都还没结婚 我们就结婚

517
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,740
I mean,we know each other, we like each other...
我们互相认识，互相喜欢

518
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,970
we've already slept together, so there'll be no surprises.
我们已经上过床，不会有意外

519
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,910
No, like, "What's that?"
不会觉得“搞什么？”

520
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,490
-Oh,you want me to be your backup. -Exactly.
你想找我当备胎？ 没错

521
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,820
Yeah. I already have one.
我已经有备胎了

522
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,650
-What? Who? -Phoebe.
是谁？ 菲比

523
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,390
Phoebe?
菲比？

524
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,770
But she just said Joey is her backup.
但是她说乔伊是她的备胎

525
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,130
Oh,I don't think so.
才不是呢

526
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,830
We just spoke. She said that she and Joey made a deal.
罗斯，我刚跟她聊过 她说她和乔伊约好了

527
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,480
That's impossible. We have had a deal for years. We shook on it.
不可能的，我们早就约好了 还握手为定

528
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,880
Although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that.
只不过她觉得握手还不够…

529
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,920
Gunther, it's Joey. Is Chandler there?
阿甘，我是乔伊，钱德在吗？

530
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,530
Listen. What kind of muffins do they serve at sea?
我问你，跑船都吃哪一种松糕

531
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,330
Where the hell have you been?!
你上哪去了？

532
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:24,160
I was making a coconut phone with the Professor.
我在跟教授做椰子电话

533
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,500
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her.
理查跟摩妮卡说他想娶她

534
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,300
-What? -I've been trying to find you.
什么？ 就是啊，我一直想去找你 叫你别玩了

536
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,070
And I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
可是这双鞋子跑一跑就掉

537
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,770
-Oh,my God! -I know! They suck!
我的天哪  就是啊，烂死了

538
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,250
He's not supposed to ask her to marry him! I am!
他不该向我的女朋友求婚 该求婚的人是我

539
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,750
-I know! -What..?
我知道 那…

540
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,050
You know what I'll do? I'll go over there and kick his ass!
你知道吗？我要去找他教训他

541
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,630
Will you help me?
你愿意帮忙吗？

542
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,530
Look, I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution, okay?
钱德，被他海扁一顿不是办法

543
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,170
-Look,just go and find Monica. -You're right.
赶快去找摩妮卡吧  你说得对

Dude! Dude! Dude!

549
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,580
That coconut phone might be good for the boat.
你的椰子电话 也许很适合摆在船上

550
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,430
Hi.

551
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,270
Hi.

552
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,810
I don't know why I'm here.

I didn't ask.

Oh,okay.
好吧

556
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,520
I'll just leave the door open and sit on the couch.

557
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,860
-Chandler is such an idiot! -Drink?
钱德真是个白痴  喝酒？

You still smoking cigars?

No, no. That's art.

563
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,940
If it bothers you, I can put my art out.

564
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,650
No,that's okay.
没关系

565
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,650
So, Monica, let me ask you a question.

566
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,790
Since we broke up, do you ever...

567

think about me?

00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,460
Actually,I thought about you a few months ago.

569
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,600
-Really? -But it's because...

I had an eye exam, and I don't like my new eye doctor.

Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

I know how to settle it. We'll do this.

and "Ross" on the other napkin and we're gonna pick one.
一张纸巾上写罗斯 然后我们一人抽一张

-We should switch. -Absolutely.
