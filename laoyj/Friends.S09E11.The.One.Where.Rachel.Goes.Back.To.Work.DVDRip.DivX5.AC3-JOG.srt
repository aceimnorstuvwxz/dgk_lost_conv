好了，别让你自己太舒服 因为我两个星期之后就回来了

我实在不太满意 你重新摆设我办公室的方式

Let me just get this straight.

我去生个小孩 然后他们派一个人过来接我的工作？

Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren altogether.
嗯，本来有说要关闭整个洛夫罗伦的

好了，你只不过是个不要脸的临时工

They didn't tell me about your quick wit.
他们并没有告诉我，你反应是如此快

那他们也没有告诉你 我是橡皮擦、你是胶水吗？

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,620
See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
看吧，身为超级英雄 听话能力可也不怎么样

154
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,320
I'm sorry. Rachel, we should probably go.
我很抱歉，瑞秋，我们该走了

He can be a little rough around the edges..

拿托盘的护士不认识乔伊的 她没有时间交朋友

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,580
She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor..
她进去手术室把托盘交给医生…

167
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,720

嘿，你知道我在想什么吗？ 我不知道“棕色警戒”是不是好的暗号

I think people might know what we're talking about.
我想大家可能都猜得到我们在说什么

181
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,810
That's fine. Listen, sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended.
没关系，听着，计划改变 我的产假要结束了

182
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,040
They said if I didn't come back today, they'd fire me.
他们说如果我不今天回去工作 他们就要开除我

我要马上通知劳委会，他们不…

没关系，冷静点，柯赐海 他们并没有真的那样说

186
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,190
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now, this guy will try and squeeze me out.
我只是害怕如果不现在回去 那个男的会把我挤掉

187
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,420
But what about Emma? I mean, we don't have a nanny.
那艾犸怎么办呢？我们还没有找到保姆

不管我决定要做什么 我都得从基层做起

197
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,400
It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it.
要一阵子我才有办法真正赚些钱

198
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,070
Maybe now's not the right time to be starting a family.
或许现在不是生小孩的好时机

199
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,880
So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
所以你要跟摩妮卡说 你现在不想要生小孩？

200
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,080

I don't feel like having sex.
我倒是不太想做爱

现在既然我回来了 何不告诉我你做了什么

214
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,780
Well, I've changed your screen saver from that picture of *NSYNC.
嗯，我把你NSYNC的荧幕保护程式改了

215
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,750
Hey, they were popular when I left.
嘿，我离开时那可是很受欢迎的

I'm working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
我在准备明天的一个重要报告

我应该要参与，跟我说明吧

不，我知道你在玩什么花样，好吗？

220
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,330
This is my job, buddy. I've had it for five years, and I know how it works.
这是我的工作，我已经做了五年了 我知道一切流程

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,490
Do you have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
你有没有蓝色的领带跟这配？ 艾犸吐奶到我的领带上

有啊，但是如果我找到工作时要还我

228
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,300
Of course, by that time, ties will be obsolete..
当然，到那时候 领带已经被淘汰了…

229
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,640
and we'll all be wearing silver jumpsuits.
而我们将全都穿起银色的连身装

230

Hey, good morning, lover.

I gotta say, after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
我得要说，在经过昨夜之后 我的双腿还在发软

232
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,350
Here's an idea. You walk into a room, take a quick scan.
麻烦你，每次走进来的时候 先快速看一下四周吧

233
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,020
Sorry.
抱歉

234
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,990
But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.

Oh, God, I have to tell you something.

What are you talking about?
你在说什么？

238
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,610
Well, that thing that I have to do to make a baby?

239
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,940
I faked it.

242
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,150
I don't need a tie.

243
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,160

It's more casual.

乔伊，听着，我办不到 这实在是没有道理

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,410
Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
昨天我是护士，然后今天我是服务生？

247
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,070
Sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
有时候我们会用相同的临时演员 扮演不同的角色，没关系的

248
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,950
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse.
是有关系的 因为昨天我扮演护士，演的相当好

249
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,580

Where will all the ribbons go?
