00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,920
Look,I'm his sister and I love him. I don't want to see him get hurt.
我可是他的妹妹 我爱他，不想看他受到伤害

160
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,290
Doesn't that give me the right to control him?
得了 我这样还没有权控制…

161
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,920
Help him?
帮助他吗？

162
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,130
He's not the one who needs help.
我觉得需要帮忙的不是他

163
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,930
She's obviously unstable.
艾蜜莉非常不稳定

164
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,570
She's thinking about running out on her wedding day.
她竟然想在结婚当天落跑

165
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,840
Okay,fine. But look at the position she's putting him in.
好啦，但你看看 她让罗斯陷入了什么处境

166
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,250
And what's he gonna do?
你要罗斯怎么办？

167
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,510
Run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?
难不成在艾蜜莉结婚当天 跑去破坏婚礼？

168
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,620
Who would do that?
谁做得出那种事？

169
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,860
Okay,fine. All right. But that was different.
好啦，不过这是两码子事

170
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,460
Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
虽然有很多人都是重复的

171
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,170
This is some twisted joke she's playing on him.
艾蜜莉显然想用变态的笑话 来恶整罗斯

172
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,540
You are crazy. She sounded genuinely upset.
够了，你疯了 她听起来真的很沮丧

174
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,000
I mean,listen.
你听听就知道

175
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,540
Your messages have been erased.
您的留言已经清除

176
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,440
No!

177
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,750
Well,that worked out well. Margarita?
这样就省事多了 来杯玛格莉特？

179
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,860
Okay,but we're safe, right? Nothing bad's gonna go down.
我们很安全，对吧？ 不可能会有厄运降临

180
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,400
No. But that reminds me. Sign this.
对，不过我倒想起来了 签一下这个

181
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,720
What is it?
这是什么？

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,660
It just says you can't sue if you scrape your knee...
没什么，只是不能告到市政府头上 就算断腿...

183
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,530
...or get your head blown off.
...或者脑袋开花

184
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,010
Oh,hurry up. I want to sign that.
快点喔，我要签

185
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,070
Here he comes.
好，他来了

186
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,910
What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?
他在干嘛？搞什么鬼？

187
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,140
What is it?
什么？…怎么了？

188
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,810
-ls everything okay? -What?
没事吧？ 发生什么事？

189
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,380
He sees us. Don't move. And don't look at him!
他看到我们了，别动 不要看他

190
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,610
Hey,it's okay. It was just a car backfire.
没事的，只是车子逆火

191
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,440
Hey, look at that. You tried to save your buddy.
看看，你想用身体掩护朋友

192
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,840
You see that?

You see what he did?

195
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,780
Thanks,Joey.
乔伊，谢了

196
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,620
Hello?

197
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,890
Hi.
嗨

198
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,490

We should go.

200
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,830

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,060
Oh,yeah. Right.
对，钱拿走

202
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,770
No. Monica.
不是啦，摩妮卡…

203
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Monica,we have to fix this.
摩妮卡，我们得补救这个

204
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,210
What can we do? You erased the message.
我们无能为力啊 你已经把留言洗掉了

205
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,350
Yeah,but maybe I could call his machine and re-create the message.
或许我可以再打电话进来 重新假造一段同样的留言

206
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,990
All right,okay....

207
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,280
Hello,Ross,this is Rachel Emily.
罗斯，我是瑞秋…艾蜜莉

208
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,790
God,what is it with those two names?
天啊 我怎么连名字都说不好

210
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,960
I do so wanted to say that I'm going to be getting married...
我打来只是要说我就快要…

212

...to another British person.

我忘记她说了什么 是啊，计划的问题就在这里

Rachel,come on. The message is erased, there's nothing we can do.
瑞秋，留言已经洗掉了 我们无能为力

218

He's never gonna find out.
罗斯永远不会发现的

219
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,580
I could tell him about it.

If you want to be rational, I can't argue with you.
如果你想要这么明理的话 我也争不过你

221

Fine,tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
你要说就说 我不想介入

223
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,030
Maybe that's Emily leaving the exact same message.
或许又是艾蜜莉打来的 她想说一样的话

224
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,780
Hey,Ross,it's you. I just want you to remember this feeling.

And also get stamps. Bye.

Play that message for Emily, and this problem goes away.
只要把这留言放给艾蜜莉听 所有的问题就都解决了

230

Right?
是吗？

231
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,090
Anybody want to meet a hero?

232
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,460
John Glenn is here?
约翰葛林来了？

233
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,230
No. Joey.
不，是乔伊

234
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,640
Joey's never been in outer space.

We had the most incredible night.

238
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,680
Okay,go ahead.

239
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,290
So we're in the car,and bang! A shot was fired.
好…我们在警车里 突然缫簧 有人开枪

242

And Joey,with no regard for his own safety...

...throws himself on me.

244

My God!
天啊，乔伊

245
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,370
It was a car backfire.

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,070
But he didn't know that.

247
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah,I didn't know that.
对，我不知道

248
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,910
It could just as easily have been a bullet.
那很有可能会是子弹的

249
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,170
Ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
乔伊，有没有想过要当警察？ 警界很需要你这种人

250
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,470
Who jumps at loud noises.
听到巨响就吓得跳起来

251
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,540
Wow. I could have died tonight.

252
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,650
Yeah,if the car that backfired had run over you!
对，如果那部放屁的车 把你碾过去的话

253
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm gonna go home,before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.

I do have a newfound respect for life.
我的人生的确有了新发现

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,830
Ross,I could have told you you weren't gonna die today.
罗斯，我早该跟你说 你今天不会有死劫的

What? You know when I'm gonna die?

You know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
你知道吗，若现在听到枪声 我一定会扑倒你身上

261
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,450
Maybe we should walk in a bad neighborhood.
是吗？那我们或许应该 去穷凶恶极的社区散步

262
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,950
Okay.
好

263
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,350
Bye.
再见 再见

264
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,560
Cut it out.
罗斯，你别再闹了

265
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,530
I'd hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day.
我不想在同一天里 先是救你又痛扁你一顿

266
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,240
Why'd you take off?
你刚才怎么先闪了？

267

Just going for a walk.
我只是去散步 

268
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,410
Around the living room,whatever.
在客厅里绕来绕去

269
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,990
-ls something wrong? -No. No,I'm just tired.
有什么不对吗？ 没有，我只是累了

271
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,490
You know,from the walk.
走路走累了

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,090
You dove in front of Ross!
好吧 你扑上去救罗斯

274
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,890
Ross!
罗斯耶！

275
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,070
That's what this is about.
原来是这么一回事

276
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,940
Oh,my God. You hate Ross!

I don't hate Ross.
我没有恨罗斯

Of course you do. I saved him. You're mad at me. It adds up.
你当然有！ 我救了他，你生我的气 这样全都说得通了

279
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,080
You want Ross out of the picture.
你想铲除罗斯？ 

280
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,780
What picture?
铲除什么？

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,650
I don't know. But I don't like what I'm hearing.
不知道，但是你说的话很吓人

282
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,820
I'm glad you saved Ross in the car backfire. But it could've been a bullet.
我很高兴你在汽车放屁事件中 救了罗斯一命 但那若真的是子弹怎么办？

284
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,290
And you didn't try to save me.
你竟然救他不救我

285
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,530
You're upset because you think I chose Ross over you.
原来你是在气这个 你以为我觉得罗斯比你重要

286
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,970
No,I knew you could take care of yourself.
不是这样的… 我知道你能照顾自己

288
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,380
You know? I mean,Ross needs help. He's not "street" like us.
罗斯需要别人帮忙 他不像你我见过大场面

289
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,210
You'd risk your life for Ross before you would for me.
话说到头，你宁愿先去救罗斯 也不来救我

290
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,110
That's the bottom line.
这才是重点

291
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,040
No,not exactly.
不完全是这样

292
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,880
All right,look.
好吧，好吧

293
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
I wasn't trying to save Ross.
其实我那不是要救罗斯

294
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,020
Okay?

295
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,960
My sandwich was next to Ross.
我的三明治在罗斯旁边

296
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,890
All right?

297
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,470
I was trying to save my sandwich.
我是要救我的三明治

298
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,040
From a bullet?
怕它被枪打到？

299
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,410
-I know it doesn't make much sense. -"Much" sense?
我知道这说来没啥道理… 岂止没啥道理

301
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,810
Look,it was instinct! I just went for it.
钱德，那是本能反应 当下就扑过去了

302
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,420
You risked your life for a sandwich?
所以你冒命去救三明治

303
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,680
I know it sounds crazy...
我知道这听起来很夸张

304
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,720
...but this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
但这可是世界上最棒的三明治

305
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,330
So you didn't choose Ross before me?
所以你并不觉得罗斯比我重要

306
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,000
No. I would never do that.
是啊，我绝对不会那样

307
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,100
You're like my brother.
你就像是我的亲兄弟

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,060
-Really? -Yeah.
真的？ 对

309
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,370
In fact,to prove how much you mean to me....
为了证明你对我的意义

310
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,020
Here.
给你

311
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,250
-Thanks. -Easy, it's not a hot dog!
谢了 轻一点，这不是热狗

313
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,190
How good is that?
是不是很好吃？

314
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,060
See?
看吧

315
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,760
What are you doing?
慢着，你在干嘛？

316
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,700
You're showing me how much I mean to you.
你不是要证明我对你的意义？

317
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,270
With a bite.
是啊，咬一口来证明

318
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,540
Jeez!
你也帮帮忙

319
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,587
嗨

320
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,580
What are you doing here?
瑞秋，你在这里干嘛？

321
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,780
Hey,you know what?

322
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,660
You are in our apartment all the time!
你动不动就往我们的公寓跑 

323
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,390
This is just a drop in the bucket,mister!
我这只是小巫见大巫而已

324
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,430
It doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
没关系啦，重点是你来了

325
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,640
You're my friend and you're here.
你是我朋友，而你来到了这里

326
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,250
Okay,just a little scared. What's going on?
好，我有一点点害怕 罗斯，你是怎么了？

327
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,010
The most amazing thing happened tonight.
今晚发生了最不寻常的事

328
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,950
I thought my number was up.
我还以为自己要去见阎王了

329
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,650
I had an actual near-death experience.
我真正面临到了濒死经验

330
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,120
What happened?
什么？…怎么回事？

331
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,800
We were on the ride-along with Gary and somebody took a shot at me!
我们不是跟盖瑞 坐警车兜风吗？ 有人朝我开枪！

333
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,190
Really?
真的吗？

334
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,530
No. A car backfired.
不是，是车子放屁

336
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,710
But I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And,Rach...
但我当时以为是有人对我开枪 瑞秋

337
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,700
...I survived!
我劫后余生

338
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,540
And I was filled with this great respect for life.
我的人生拥有了全新视野

339
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,050
I want to experience every moment.
我要真切体验每一刻

340
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,550
I want to seize every opportunity.
我要把握每一个机会

341
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,460
I am seeing everything so clearly now.
现在的一切都变得好清晰

342
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,860
Because a car backfired?
全都是因为汽车放屁？

343
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,530
Okay. Why are you here?
好吧，你来这里干嘛？

344
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,470
I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing...
我不知道这件事符不符合 你所谓的“把握今朝”

345
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,230
...but Emily called you today.
不过艾蜜莉今天打了电话给你

346
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,810
-You talked to her? -She left a message.
你跟她说了话？ 没有，她在你电话里留言

347
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,910
But it kind of got erased.
不过留言被洗掉了

349
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,710
I mean,there's something wrong with your machine.
你的答录机有问题

350
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,320
What did she say?
那她说了什么？

351
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,920
Something about having second thoughts about the wedding...
说什么对结婚的事有点反悔

352
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,190
...and did you guys make a mistake breaking up?
说你们分手是个错误

353
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,720
And she wants you to call her.
她要你回电

354
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,720
Wow.

355
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,100
That was a good thing that I told you, right?
我跟你说这件事很对吧？

356
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,770
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

357
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,030
Okay,thank you. Thank you. Because

358
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,750
I'm gonna go tell Monica I was right.
我要去跟摩妮卡说 我这样做是对的

359
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,610
Because she didn't want
因为你知道吗？她不希望… 

360
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,180
Not important. Point is, I was right. Your decision.
那不重要 重点是我是对的，你自己决定

361
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,440
Okay?

362
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,020
I was right.
我是对的 

363
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,020
Your decision.

00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,280
Right.
对

365
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,190
I guess I should call Emily.
我猜我应该回电给艾蜜莉

366
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,690
No, that's not the right decision.
不对，你的决定不对…

367
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,400
That's not right.
这样不对

368
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,890
Ross,come on!
罗斯，你清醒一点

369
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,290
I mean...
我是说...

370
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,960
...that woman made you miserable!
...那个女人把你给整惨了

371
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,470
Do you really want to get back into that?
罗斯，你真的想要再来一次？

372
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,910
Okay,look. Yesterday...
如果她是在昨天打来的 

373
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,270
...I wouldn't have even considered calling her back.
我压根不会想回电

374
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,980
But my ex-wife calls on the same day...
但在我面对濒死经验的同一天 

375
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,650
...I have a near-death experience?
我的前妻正好打电话来

376
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,910
That's gotta mean something.
这一定有所含意

377
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,720
That was not a near-death experience. That was barely an experience.
罗斯，那不是濒死经验 就连经验都谈不上了

378
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,160
You weren't there!
当时你并不在场

379
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,930
Maybe this is something that I'm supposed to seize, you know?
或许这就是我应该把握的事

380
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,460
Okay. You know what?
好吧，你知道吗？

381
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,170
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
或许这无关把握或是不把握

382
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,970
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
或许这是关于逃避

383
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,010
Okay? Look at today.
就拿今天来说

384
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,840
I mean,you escaped...
你逃过了…

385
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,470
...death.

386
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,950
And maybe this is a chance for you to escape...
或许这是你逃避机会 

387
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,160
...getting back together with Emily.
不去和艾蜜莉复合

388
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,090
That does make sense.
这还蛮有道理的

389
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,630
Because I do want to seize some opportunity...
因为我要把握住这个机会 

390
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,460
...but I really don't want to see or talk to her.
不和她见面或联络

391
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,110
Well,there you go!
这不就结了

392
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,270
Yeah,maybe today's just...
或许今天只是...

393
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,280
..."close call" day.
...“千钧一发”日

394
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,480
Hey, thanks, Rach.

395

Oh, honey. No problem.
亲爱的，甭客气

396
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,050
Wait, wait. The message is blinking.
等等…留言灯号在闪

397
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,190
Maybe you didn't erase it.
或许留言没被洗掉

398
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,900
Hey,Ross,it's you
罗斯，是你啊

399
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,520
That's an old message. Nobody needs to hear that.
这是旧的留言 没什么好听的 没错

401
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,170
-Hey,was Monica here? -Yeah.
摩妮卡有来过吗？ 有啊

402

I want my money back.
要她把我的钱还来

403
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,140
You probably need that for stamps, right?
是要用来买邮票的吧？

404
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,320
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?
菲比，盖瑞有真的中枪过吗？

405
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,650
Yes,once.

406
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,880
A little.
小小的一次

407
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,390
He kind of did it to himself.

408
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,050
It's not really a good story.
这故事没什么好讲的

409
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,390
I wonder how I'd react under fire. And not backfire...

410
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,160
...but heavy fire.
是枪林弹雨

411
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Like,if I was in a war.
好比我在战场上之类的

412
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,540
Man,I would be great in a war!

413
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,740
I think I'd make a fantastic military leader.
一定会是很棒的军事领袖

414
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,570

跟你们这些人比起来 我一定会最先当上将军

Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
在你被自己的部下枪杀前 还是之后？

I know Joey would be in the foxhole protecting all of us.

If the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.

Yeah, hero sandwiches.

420
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,090
You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm not interested in war in any way.
你们知道我主张和平 我对什么战争都没兴趣

Not you, Joey.
乔伊，你例外

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
