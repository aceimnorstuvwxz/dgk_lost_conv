But it's dark out.
可是外面还很黑

5
00:00:32,06 --> 00:00:35,72
That's because you always sleep till noon,silly.

This is what nine looks like.

I'm getting tired of always sneaking around.

10
00:00:50,28 --> 00:00:54,67
Me too. What if we went away for the weekend? No interruptions.

12
00:00:54,78 --> 00:00:56,77
We could be naked the entire time.

13
00:00:57,42 --> 00:01:00,35
All weekend? That's a whole lot of naked.
整个周末？那可是很长

14
00:01:01,06 --> 00:01:04,92
I'll say I have a conference and you can have a chef thing.
我可以说我去开会 你就说去参加厨师研讨

15
00:01:05,13 --> 00:01:08,12
I wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey!

16
00:01:08,36 --> 00:01:10,46
Okay. You know you're not,though.

你们知道我这周末要干嘛吗？去纽泽西参加烹饪大会

23
00:02:15,36 --> 00:02:19,03
How weird! Chandler just said he's got a conference there.
钱德刚才说要去那里开会

24
00:02:20,87 --> 00:02:24,70
That's funny. Seems like Chandler's conference could've been...
真有意思 钱德应该可以 

26
00:02:24,94 --> 00:02:26,63
...in Connecticut or Vermont.
去康州或维蒙开会

27
00:02:28,94 --> 00:02:32,21
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
我又不能决定在哪里开会

28
00:02:32,61 --> 00:02:36,57
Do you want people to think it's fake? It's a real conference.
难道你希望大家认为我造假？ 因为我可没说谎

29
00:02:38,79 --> 00:02:41,58
-ls Rachel here? -No,she's out shopping.
瑞秋在吗？我要找她 
她出去逛街了

31
00:02:42,12 --> 00:02:44,11
-Damn! -What's going on?
可恶 怎么了？ 

33
00:02:45,33 --> 00:02:46,82
I told Emily to come.
我叫艾蜜莉来

34
00:02:47,06 --> 00:02:51,26
And I just need to,you know, talk to Rachel about it.
所以我得赶快跟瑞秋说

35
00:02:52,63 --> 00:02:54,12
Wait a minute.
等等

36
00:02:54,34 --> 00:02:57,57
When Emily comes, you won't see Rachel anymore?
艾蜜莉来了之后 你真的就不见瑞秋了？

37
00:02:57,71 --> 00:03:00,87
I'm focusing on the "I get to see my wife" part...
我现在只能专心想着 “我可以见我老婆”

38
00:03:01,08 --> 00:03:03,98
...and not on the part that makes me do this.
不去想我快胃溃疡的事

39
00:03:07,05 --> 00:03:09,61
So you'll never be in a room together?
你们再也不能共处一室？

40
00:03:09,82 --> 00:03:11,51
How will that even work?
这怎么可能？

41
00:03:11,75 --> 00:03:13,58
I have no idea. I mean....
我也不知道

42
00:03:13,82 --> 00:03:16,88
But I assure you, I will figure it out.
但是我一定会想到办法

43
00:03:19,26 --> 00:03:21,49
It doesn't seem like it'll work.
看起来实在不可能…

44
00:03:23,67 --> 00:03:24,86
Hi,guys.
大家好 嗨

45
00:03:24,87 --> 00:03:26,27
嘿

46
00:03:26,43 --> 00:03:27,49
What's going on?
怎么了？

47
00:03:28,67 --> 00:03:31,00
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
我们正要帮摩妮卡翻床垫

48
00:03:33,61 --> 00:03:37,67
So I'm thinking,basically, we pick it up and then we flip it.
我认为应该先抬起来再翻过来

49
00:03:39,61 --> 00:03:41,28
That's better than my way.
这方法比我的主意好

50
00:03:43,05 --> 00:03:45,58
Hey guys,would you flip mine too?
你们顺便帮我翻

51
00:03:45,89 --> 00:03:47,41
Oh,man.
受不了

52
00:03:50,73 --> 00:03:53,25
Oh,look! A letter from my mom.
我妈寄信来

53
00:03:55,13 --> 00:03:56,93
So,Rach?
瑞秋，

54
00:03:57,87 --> 00:04:00,06
You know how Emily's coming?
你知道艾蜜莉要来

55
00:04:00,27 --> 00:04:01,90
Oh,yeah. I know.
我知道啊

56
00:04:02,24 --> 00:04:03,76
Can you hear anything?
听得到吗？

57
00:04:03,97 --> 00:04:06,96
Yeah,somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
当然，刚刚有人说 “听得到吗？”

58
00:04:11,98 --> 00:04:14,11
Hey,Joey's ass.

What are you doing?
你在做什么？

60
00:04:17,82 --> 00:04:20,22
Remember when they fought and broke up...
记得上次他们吵架分手时 

61
00:04:20,42 --> 00:04:23,48
...and we were stuck here all night with no food?
我们卡在房里没东西可吃吗？

62
00:04:23,73 --> 00:04:27,99
When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding, I figured it'd happen again.
罗斯在婚礼上说出瑞秋名字后 我猜旧戏可能会重演

63
00:04:28,50 --> 00:04:30,26
So I hid this in here.
所以我在这里藏了这些东西

64
00:04:30,83 --> 00:04:33,06
Candy bars,crossword puzzles....
有糖果，猜谜…

65
00:04:33,27 --> 00:04:35,13
Mad Libs! Mine!
还有疯狂字谜，我要

What do you got in here? Magazines,Doritos

Condoms?
保险套？

71
00:04:51,35 --> 00:04:54,19
You don't know how long we'll be in here.
谁晓得会在这里待多久

72
00:04:54,52 --> 00:04:56,58
We may have to repopulate the Earth.
搞不好我们还得负责 繁衍人类后代

73
00:04:58,93 --> 00:05:01,72
And condoms are the way to do that?
戴保险套还想繁衍后代？

74
00:05:03,80 --> 00:05:07,29
Anyway,it all boils down to this.
有个关键问题

75
00:05:07,64 --> 00:05:12,16
-The last time I talked to Emily -Oh,my God! Our dog died!

80
00:05:24,42 --> 00:05:26,39
Sorry.

It says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for...

This is so great. No one's gonna bother us.

And we're gonna do it.

The glasses have lipstick on them.

如果连杯子都没换 谁晓得还有哪些东西没换

You wanna switch rooms because they didn't switch the glasses?
饭店没换杯子你就要换房间？
