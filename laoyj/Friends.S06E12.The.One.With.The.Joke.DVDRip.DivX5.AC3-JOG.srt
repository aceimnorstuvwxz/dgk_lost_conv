00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,660
That was funny.

141
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,990
-It was kind of funny. -It wasn't funny at all!

142
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,160
Why would you do that?

145
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,270
The reason I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you...
我之所以比较倾向瑞秋

146
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,350
is just, you know, you're...
是因为你…

147
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,140
high maintenance. Let's go to lunch!
有点难搞 我们去吃饭吧

148
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,780
That is completely untrue.

149
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,320
You think I'm high maintenance? Prove it.
你觉得我难搞？ 证明给我看

No, you're right, you're easygoing.
你说得对，你很好相处

flexible and mellow. That's all.

Well,people are different.

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,270
Rachel will do whatever you want. You can just walk all over her.
瑞秋什么都好 怎么欺负她都行

慢着，你是说我没个性吗？ 我才没有

-I cannot believe her. -I know. Where do you want to eat?
她真是太扯了 就是啊，你想吃什么？

这件事蛮尴尬的 我之前是演员，现在是服务生

Come on,I did it and it was fine.

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,500
then you decide which one of us is telling the truth. Me.
你再决定谁说的是实话…是我

278
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,400
Chandler, you first.
钱德，你先

279
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,040
I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
好，我是2个月前 跟史提夫吃饭时想到的

280
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,770
-Did I meet him at Christmas? -Can I finish?
就是圣诞节那砘锫穑 让我说完好吗？ 

281
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,520
You want me to pick you?
你要我选你吗？

282
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,050
See,I would never snap at you like that.
我绝对不会那样凶你

283
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,410
Two babies.

284
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,590
-Continue. -Okay.
请继续

285
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,530
Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
史提夫说他去看医生 他的医生姓侯奇

286
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
我说“猴子医生？” 所以才会有猴子医生这个笑话

287
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,770
Are you kidding?
你开什么玩笑

288
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,920
Okay,look,I study evolution.
我是学进化论的 

289
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,550
Remember? Evolution.
记得吧？进化论

290
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,380
Monkey into man.
猴子进化成人

291
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,280
Plus,I'm a doctor. And...
况且我是博士

292
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,550
I had a monkey.
我还养过猴子

293
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,630
I'm Dr. Monkey!
我是猴子博士

294
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,730
I'm not arguing with that.
这点我不跟你争

295
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,090
I've heard enough for my decision.
好，可以了，我决定好了

296
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,930
-Okay,so what..? -Do tell.
那是？？ 

297
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,400
You are both idiots.
你们两个都是白痴

298
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,640
It's not funny. And it's offensive to women.
那个笑话不但不好笑 还冒犯了女性

299
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,970
And doctors. And monkeys.
还有医生，还有猴子

300
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,510
You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.
你们不该争笑话是谁的

301
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,650
You should argue over who gets blamed for inflicting this joke on the world.
应该争是谁让这世界受这种罪

302
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,290
Now,let it go.
别再争了

303
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,650
The joke sucks.
那个笑话烂透了

304
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,130
-It's your joke. -It is not.

305
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,040
-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are. -Hi.

Hey,it's Phoebe and Rachel.

what you told me about me not being high maintenance.

Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.

310
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,640
Being with her has been like being on a vacation.

generosity of spirit.

316
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,350
Really? I've heard better.

317

Wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them.
等等，那是他自己说的 你告诉她们

318
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,760
I'm out of words. Should I say it again?

320

And that's good.

326
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,460
And when you get upset about little things,I think I'm pretty good...
当你为小事不高兴时 我觉得...

327

at making you feel better.

328
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,730
That's good too. They say you're high maintenance...
那样也很好 所以她们说你难搞也行 

330

335
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,050
It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.

344
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,420
but Gunther said I had to stay so he could get his hair dyed.

So I went anyway, and he fired me.

What are you gonna do?

You can't let him get away with that.
