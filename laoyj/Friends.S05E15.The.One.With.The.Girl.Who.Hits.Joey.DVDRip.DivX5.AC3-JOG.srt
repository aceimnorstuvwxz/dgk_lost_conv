00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,230
You know,I like all of you guys now. But when I first met you, you know?

280
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,770
Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.

281

Lola?

282
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
Mind-numbingly stupid.

283
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,610
You guys. Gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.
还有你们 淘金女，老牛吃嫩草的变态

284
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,120
So I think you all know what I mean.

285
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,620
Obviously, I didn't think they would throw things.

286
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,700
I thought if I kept insulting them you'd defend them.
我想说我一直羞辱他们 你就会跳出来帮他们

287

Then you'd look like the hero.
你就可以变成英雄 对喔

288
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,540
See,I did not get that.

289
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,140
Where's Monica? I need to talk to her, it's urgent.

I've been thinking...

...about us. A lot of "us" thinking.

I guess there's only one way to do this.

Will you marry me?

298
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,080
What a bad idea.

I don't know.

But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

The best reason is pregnancy.

306

Sorry is fourth,behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.

Will you be my wife?

钱德，你先静下来 想想这件事有多荒谬

309
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,060
I'm kind of wishing everyone wasn't here now.
我的确有点希望他们都不在

310
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,900
None of that came from me.
这些事都不是我扯出来的 

311

I never said I wanted to have babies and get married!

I was really confused. Then I talked to these guys.

Who? Two divorces and Joey?

She's right,you know?

Yeah,but still, cheap shot!

316
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,460
You know when I said that I want you...
你知道吗？ 

317
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,790
...to deal with relationship stuff all on your own?
我不是要你自己想该怎么做?

318
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,230
You're not ready.
你还做不到这一点 

319
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,660
I didn't think I was!
我也这么认为

320
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh,my God.
天哪

321
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,770
What would you have done if I had said yes?
要是我答应了呢？

322
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,950
I would've been happy because...
那我会很开心 

323
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,910
...I would spend the rest of my life with the woman I love.
能跟心爱的人共度下半生

324
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,450
Or you would have seen a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.
又或者你会在那扇门上 看到我的人形洞

325
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,930
Will you pass that knife?
罗斯，请把刀子给我 

326
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,920
No,I will not.
我才不要

327
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,390
You don't have to be mean about it.
你不必这么凶吧

328
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,700
You're right. I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
你说得对，对不起 嫁给我好吗？

329
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,000
I was going to ask you to marry me because I didn't say hello to you.
我正想向你求婚 因为我上星期忘了跟你打招呼

330
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,080
Or ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure. Chandler?
那种情况应该只需要同居 但我也不确定，钱德？

331
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,740
How long is this going to go on?
好，我还要被笑多久？

332
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,010
I think the length of teasing...
那得看...

333
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,590
...is directly related to how insane you were. So a long time.
...你做的事有多扯 所以…会很久

334
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,210
This is fun!
真好玩 

335
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,890
Remember that "we were on a break" thing?
记得“我们分手了”风波吗？

336
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,290
I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
我很抱歉，嫁给我好吗？

337
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,370
That's not funny.
不好笑 冷死了

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
