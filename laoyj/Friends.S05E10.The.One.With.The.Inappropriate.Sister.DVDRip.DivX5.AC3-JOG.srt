00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,900
-I'll stop. -Don't stop.
我不玩就是了 继续玩

158
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,770
Move the bowl further away. Ross could make that shot.
碗拿远一点 连罗斯都投得进

159
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,650
Well, you suck. But at least you suck at a man's game now.
真是逊毙了 不过至少你进了成人组

160
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,780
-Want to play? -I can't play games.
要不要玩？ 我不能跟你玩 

162
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,290
Ross'll be home soon. I have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.
罗斯就快回来了 按照他的时间表 我应该写完5页

163
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,120
So play for 30 minutes, then write until he gets home.
你可以先玩30分钟 再继续用功到他回家

164
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,850
All right.
好吧

165
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,820
But listen,what do you say we...
不过 

166
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,790
...crank it up a notch?
规则应该更困难

167
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,190
I'm intrigued.
愿闻其详

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,030
All right. All we need is a little lighter fluid.
要先找到可燃性液体

169
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,370
But be careful. I want our security deposit back.
好，不过你小心点 我还想拿回房租押金

170
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,440
We said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.
我们发明铁锤标枪时 就拿不回来了

171
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,050
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
你记得哪面墙壁没补过吗？ 记得，这里

173
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,020
Thank you! Happy holiday.

174
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,390
No,that's trash,young lady. You can't
小姐，那可是垃圾，不可以…

175
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,830
Stop that young lady! She donated trash!

176
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,900
The charity's on fire!

Help! Thank you. I need that!

178
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,710
What is this?
那是什么鬼东西？

179
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,470
It's 9:00 in the morning!

180
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,040
All right. "A room."
我看看，场景，房间 

181
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,840
"A man enters. He looks suspicious."
一名男子满脸狐疑地走进来

182
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,120
That's it?
就这样？

183
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,160
You're supposed to have five pages done by now...
乔伊，你今天应该写5页 

184
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,560
...including an exciting incident.

185
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,200
What is all this? "The Official Rulebook of Fireball."
这是什么垃圾？ 大火球游戏规则

187
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,040
That's the game we played.
我们刚在玩这游戏

188
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,680
It's great. You take a tennis ball,a bowl and lighter
很好玩，道具就是一颗网球 一个碗、可燃液体

189
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,950
This is helping your career? You wanted to be an actor.
这对你的事业有帮助吗？我还以为你想当演员 

190
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,450
Not the creator of "Crazy Lawsuit Game."
不是发明危险游戏被人告

191
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,920
You're right. I'll get back to work.
你说得对，我该工作了

192
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,760
Shame on you! You should know better! Joey needs to work.
你真不应该，还带坏他 明知道乔伊应该要工作

193
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,900
Now come on.

195
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,570
You can have this back when the five pages are done.
等你写完5页才还你

-I had a nice time tonight. -So did l.

I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
幸好摩妮卡约我们出来

199
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,220
I'd love to ask you in, but my sister's visiting.
我很想请你进去 不过我妹来住我家 

201
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,770
-I think she's asleep on the couch. -Your sister?
她可能睡在沙发上了 你妹妹？

Your sister's asleep on the couch?

203

I saw you with her on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
我上次看到你们搭地铁 现在她还睡在你沙发

204
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,080
-I thought I heard you. -Hey,great,you're up.

Rachel,my sister Krista.

Nice to meet you.

208
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,920
I wish you'd warned me. I'd have fixed myself up.
你应该告诉我要带朋友回来 害我穿得邋里邋遢

210
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,020
-Like it would help. -You are so bad.
有差吗？ 你真恶劣

212
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,320
-You are. -You are.

213
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000

215
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,700
You are so dead.

217
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,090
I'm gonna get you. Come here!

It's very nice to meet you.

219

Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket!
没有人，没一个人尊重募捐筒

220
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,750
You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
大家都丢些莫名其妙的东西

221
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,050
Does this look like a garbage can to you?
你觉得这像垃圾桶吗？

222
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,460
Does it look like an ashtray?
不像 像烟灰缸吗？

223
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,830
Does it look like a urinal?
不像 像尿桶吗？

224
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,000
-So you going back out there? -Yeah, but I won't take any more crap.
菲比，你还要回去募捐吗？ 当然，不过我受够了

226
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,670
No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
再也不当募捐好好小姐

227
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,240
Good. You're tough. You lived on the street.
加油，你在街上流浪过，够悍

228
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,920
I'll go back to being Street Phoebe.
我要当回强人菲比

229
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,310
But not totally back. Street Phoebe wouldn't be friends with you guys.
不过也不能一模一样 否则才不会鸟你们 抱歉啦

230
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,480
Can I ask you guys something?
可以问个问题吗？ 当然

231
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,460
I don't have brothers,so I don't know, but did you guys wrestle?
我没有兄弟，实在不沤 你们会打来打去吗？

233

-Oh,yeah. -All the time.

In fact,I was undefeated.

236
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,770
Well,you weighed 200 pounds.
因为你以前90多公斤

237
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,800
Still,I was quick as a cat.

238
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,310
I met Danny's sister yesterday.
我昨天碰到丹尼的妹妹

...wrestle-y.
...会扭打

243
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,690
But I guess that's normal?
这样正常吗？

244
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,790
We don't wrestle now.
我们现在不会这样了

245
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,560
Not since I got too strong for you.
自从我长大变壮后就不打了

246
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,690
Too strong for me?

You wanna go right now?

Actually,that helps a lot. Thanks.
谢谢你们帮了大忙

254
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes!
赶快走，20分后就要开打了 乔伊，快点

255
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,270
Joey's not going.
乔伊不能去

256
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,770
I didn't finish my five pages.
我还没写完5页

257
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,700
Finish them tomorrow.

Tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.

259
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,340
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
我昨天写的有待改进

260
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,750
Cut him some slack. If he relaxes, he'll get some work done.
别再逼他，让他透口气 搞不好会写得更好

261
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,510
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you...
他已经透够多气了 这都要感谢你跟...

262
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,050
...and Fireball.
...大火球

263
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,550
If you think Fireball's relaxing, you've never played.
玩大火球可是很紧张 显然你没玩过

264
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,520
You're doing this because you're bored.
你拼命压榨乔伊 是因为你自己没事做

265
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,890
It's not his fault you're unemployed.
又不是乔伊害你失业的

266
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,760
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
我不是失业，只是进修中

267
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,400
Guys,don't fight.
你们别吵架

268
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,080
And I'm doing this because I am Joey's friend.
我之所以这么做 是因为我是乔伊的朋友

269
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,280
If you were a friend, you'd be doing the same.
如果你也是他朋友 就该学学我

270
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,710
So being a friend means being a jerk?
当朋友就得这么混帐？

271
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,110
If it does,then you're an amazing friend of mine.
要是真如你所说 你可真是我第一号好友

272
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,150
Let's settle this over a game of Fireball.
别吵了，大家玩场大火球 别气了

273
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,050
-I'll unhook the smoke detectors. -Let's settle this right now.
我去拆掉防火警铃 现在就一了百了

275
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,560
There. Now no one's going to the game.
好了，谁也不准去

276
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,430
-I paid for those! -You said you would,but you didn't.
门票是我买的 才怪，你每次都说要付钱 却一次也没吐过钱

278
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,860
Oh,yeah.
也对

279
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,440
We finally get to the top of the mountain...
我们终于爬到山顶

280
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,580
...and airhead here forgets the camera.
结果这个笨蛋竟然忘了相机

281
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,680
The same thing happened to me one time.
我也发生过这种事情

282
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,660
When did that happen to you?
什么时候？

283
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,620
Remember? We were jogging and saw that bird.
上次我们不是到公园慢跑 看到小鸟

284
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,200
I wanted to take a picture, but I didn't have my camera.
我想拍下来 竟然没带相机

285
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,200
Chasing the churro guy is not jogging.
也对，不过追小贩可不算慢跑

286
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,130
Oh,this is so good. You have got to try it.
超好吃，你一定要吃一口

287
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,120
-Damn. I got it on my pants. -Here,I'll get it.
糟糕，裤子沾到了 我来擦

289
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,660
We better take them off or the stain will set.
最好上楼换件裤子 否则以后洗不掉

290
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,060
-I want to wear them tonight. -Oh,great.
而且我今晚约会还要穿 真好

292
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,290
Okay, bye. Oh,my God!
再见，天哪

293
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,570
-That was unbelievable. -See? I told you.
不可思议 看吧，我早说过了

294
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,140
Yeah. Sorry.
可怜的瑞秋

295
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,140
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
我不相信他们是兄妹

297
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,410
They're brother and sister?!
他们是兄妹？

298
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,620
I guess you'll have to cancel your date.
看来你得取消约会了

299
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,280
And call their mother.
而且还要打电话给他们老妈

300
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,627
“非尿桶”

301
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,322
“我没有百货公司简介”

302
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,760
Wait a minute. Open your hand. Let me take a look.
等一下，手张开给我检查

303
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,940
Quarter,dime. Lint? Not interested in that.
两毛五、一毛、线头？不要

304
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,500
What's this? A Canadian coin?
这是什么？加拿大硬币？

305
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,730
Get out of here!
滚

306
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,110
No drinks near the bucket.
不准在募捐筒旁边喝东西

307
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,120
Set it down there and then you can make a contribution.
