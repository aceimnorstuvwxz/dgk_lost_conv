I don't allow porn at home, so this is like a vacation for him.
我不许家里有色情书刊 所以这对他而言简直是快乐假期

接下来才是最困难的部份 你难道不担心结果吗？

257
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,950
I mean, oh, when Sid and I did this last time, my God, I was a mess.
我是说，当西德跟我上次来做的时候 我的天，我紧张死了

258
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,130
I haven't even thought about the results.

I just assumed everything would be okay.

Well, you know what? It probably is.

我是说万一我们不孕是有原因的呢？

Chandler. Look, you and Monica are meant to have children.
钱德，听着，你跟摩妮卡一定会有小孩

是啊，是啊，好了，谢谢 我不敢相信我竟然没有想过

我是说我好担心要过来这里做检验

267

你可以在顶呱呱的停车场做…

-你为什么会那样觉得呢？ -我不知道

276
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,570
Maybe it's because she's got such callousy fingers..

from playing crummy guitar.

Well, for like a half an hour!

Man, you can lie about Sweden!

-你为什么没说你在这里工作呢？ -我不需要告诉你每件事！

Why did you lie to me about working here?
为什么你不敢说你在这里工作呢？

288
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,350
Because I was ashamed, okay? I sold out for the cash.
因为我觉得很丢脸，好吗？ 我为五斗米而折腰

289
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,750
And they give me benefits, like medical and dental and a four-oh-wunk.
他们提供一些福利，像是健保什么的

290
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,930
But, you know, you pay a price. Now I'm this corporate stooge..
但是你知道的，要付出代价的 现在我成了大公司的傀儡
