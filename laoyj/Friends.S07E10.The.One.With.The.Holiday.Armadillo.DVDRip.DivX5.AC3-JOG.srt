00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,350
why not something more subtle...
何不送更微妙一点的…

139
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,930
Like a wrecking ball...
像是铁锤…

140
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,570
or a vial of small pox to release in the hallway?
或是天花病毒散播在走廊上？

141
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,670
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes...
不只是鼓的声音，每5分钟…

142
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,170
Joey throws his sticks in the air...
乔伊把鼓棒丢到空中…

143
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,340
and I have to hear: "Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"
然后我就会听到： “我的眼睛！我的眼睛！”

144
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,130
-I mean, it's so annoying. -Yes, thank you.
-烦死人了 -谢谢你

145
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,940
You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.

146
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,880
You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...
菲比，你送乔伊鼓是为了烦瑞秋…

147
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,620
so she wouldn't want to live there anymore?
让她不想继续住在那里？

148
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,790
Maybe on some level.
可能有一点

149
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,500
You could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
乔伊，你知道你不用丢鼓棒的

150
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

151
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,880
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

154

tarantula!

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,930
God, Rachel, I'm sorry. What was I thinking...

157
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,260
giving Joey this big, gross,  scary spider...
送乔伊这么一个 恶心的，可怕的蜘蛛…

158
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,030
in such a poorly constructed cage?

159
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,330
What are you talking about? I love them.
你在说什么？我喜欢它

160
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,440
I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it died because my cat ate it.

And then my cat died.

But, Joey, isn't this cool?
乔伊，这不是很酷吗？

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,550
Is it on me? I feel like it's on me. I got..
在我身上吗？ 我觉得它在我身上，我…

164
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,050
Oh, isn't that adorable?
不是很可爱吗？

165
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,360
Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

And that makes you angry because...?

Because you'd rather live here with Joey.

said you were having so much fun here...
说你和乔伊住得很开心…

176

to try to drive me out of the apartment?

You might as well have gotten him a fish.

We're roommates. That's the deal.
