You have to lift it and point.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,500
Oh,forget it.
算了

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,030
Let's play that game where everyone says one thing they're thankful for.
你们知道吗？ 我们应该来玩感恩告白游戏

I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.

突然吹来一阵秋风 把一个女生的裙子吹了起来

17
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,700
It's not so much an underpant as a feat of engineering.
与其说它是内裤 不如说是一种伟大工程

18
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,370
It's amazing...
效果那么惊人

19
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,810
...how much they can do with so little material.
料子却那么少

20
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,210
And they play with your mind. Is it there? Is it not there?
它还会戏弄你 有穿吗？没穿吗？

21
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,880
Are you aware that you're still talking?
你知道你还在碎碎念吗？

Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
有没有人要感谢 丁字裤以外的东西？

23
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,260
I don't know. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction?
我不知道要比较感谢离婚 还是被赶出来

24
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,760
And I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
我还以为你会没得谢

I'm sorry. This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.

你不能挟失败的婚姻空降 抢了我的宝座

Come on! I want to hear it.
别这样嘛，我想听

30
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,450
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out.
没有钱德扫兴就不算感恩节了

31
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,530
It's a tradition,like the parade.
这跟游行一样是一项传统

32
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,230
If the parade decided it was gay and abandoned its family.
如果游行也出柜离家 抛妻弃子的话

...just because we're getting a divorce...

...doesn't mean we don't love you.

More turkey,Mr. Chandler?
小少爷还要火鸡吗？

39
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,330
Every time you tell that story, that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.
你把那砘锏目谝 说得越来越重

40
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,290
So are he and your dad still together?
他们还在一起吗？

41
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,560
No. After they got their own place, the houseboy got his own houseboy.
没有，他们同居之后 男仆自己也有了男仆

42
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,100
Should have heard his accent.
你应该听听他的口音

You're right,yours is worse. You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.
你说得对，你的更惨 你是悲惨感恩节盟主

I've got one that's worse.
不一定，我有一次更惨

45
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,550
Really? Worse than, "More turkey,Mr. Chandler?"
惨过“小少爷还要火鸡”吗？

46
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,190
Did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler?

No,Chandler's is worse.

It must be cool remembering stuff like that.

I don't have any past-life memories.
我都没有前世的记忆

59

Of course,you don't,sweetie. You're brand-new.

Plus,it smells really bad in here.

It really creeps me out when you call it that.
