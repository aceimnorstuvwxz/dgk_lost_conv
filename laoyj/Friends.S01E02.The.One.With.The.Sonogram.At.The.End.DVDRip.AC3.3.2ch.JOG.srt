before Pink Floyd comes out.
你得耐着性子先看完脱口秀

Word of advice: Bring back the comedian.
是哦?给你一个建议 叫脱口秀主持人再度上场

Or next time you'll find yourself listening to that album alone.
否则下次，你们只能坐家里听唱片

Wait a minute. Why is she in the title?

It's my baby too.

他知道别人只会叫她盖勒  这样他就得逞了

My way? You think this is my way?

Of all the ways I ever imagined this moment being..
相信我，我没想到自己会沦落到这种地步
