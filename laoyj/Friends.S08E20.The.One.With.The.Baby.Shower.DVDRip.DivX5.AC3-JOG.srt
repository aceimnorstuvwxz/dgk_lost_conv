-Hi! -Hey!

So, what's the final head count on my baby shower?
有多少人会来参加 宝宝的欢迎会？

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,710
About twenty. Couple people from work had something else to do.
大约有20个人 有些同事有事没办法来

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,840
Your sisters called and can't make it.
你的妹妹们打电话来说她们没办法来

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,710
What? You mean they're not coming to a social event..
什么？ 你说她们不来参加…

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,150
where there's no men and no booze? That's shocking.
没有男人跟酒的社交聚会？ 那真的是太稀奇了

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,280
I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
我不在乎，只要我妈能来就行了

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,450

-天啊，你妈 -什么？我妈不会来吗？

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,290
Well, given that we forgot to invite her, it would be a big coincidence if she was.
说不定我们忘了邀请她 反而能让她松口气

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,720
My God!

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,690
Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,570
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?

00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,410
Neither is mine.
我妈也不会来

We'll take care of it. We'll call her. You go home and get ready.
我们会处理的，我们会打电话给她 你先回家做准备

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,780

你去吧，我记在我的电话簿里了

If you're in charge of invitations, why am I calling her?
如果你负责寄请帖 为什么是我打电话给她？

22

为了没有邀请我 还是你说谎骗我呢？
