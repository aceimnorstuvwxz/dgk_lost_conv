You're acting strange.

All right. There is something.

I kind of had a dream.

But I don't want to talk about it.

151
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,560
What if Martin Luther King had said that?

I kind of have a dream.

Look,it involved Monica.

There was no sex. I haven't dreamt of her like that...

159
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,890
...since I found out about you two. More or less.
自从发现你们的事 我就不对她做那种梦了

160

What was the dream about?

Like you did last night.

就这样，我爱上摩妮卡了 我会搬走

Joey, come on. That doesn't mean you're in love with me.
乔伊 等等，那并不代表你爱我

167
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,880
It doesn't?
不是吗？ 

168
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,780
It could mean anything. Like...
它可能有很多涵义，例如…

169
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,460
...you're jealous that I've become the apartment stud.

Sounds like your dream.

171
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,760
Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me being close and stuff...

172
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,800
...and you want that too.

In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.

174
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,770
If that's what it was,that'd be great. I wouldn't have to move.
如果是这样就太好了 我就不必搬走了

175
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,300
Are you attracted to Monica?
你现在对摩妮卡有兴趣吗？

Right here,right now, are you attracted to her?

But that's good!

It's not just about getting a girlfriend.
我觉得不是交女朋友的问题

182

I could get a girlfriend. We could sit and do crossword puzzles.
我可以找个女朋友 我们可以坐在那里填字谜

183
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,840
But could we have the closeness like you have?
但我们会拥有你们那种亲密吗

184
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,300
Monica and I were friends before we dated. Maybe that's it.
摩妮卡和我是从朋友做起 也许关键在这里

185
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,520
Friends first?

That's interesting.

Excuse me. Is this your car?

放心，没关系的

应该是转不动了 我觉得挤不上去

I don't think it'll pivot any more.
我看是上不来了 

286
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,820
You think?
是吗？

287
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,930
All right,let's bring it back down and try again.

I think it's really stuck now.
现在真的卡死了

289
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,600
-I can't believe that didn't work. -I know. Me neither.

291
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,540
I mean,you had a sketch.
你都画了图了

292
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,080
What did you mean when you said "pivot"?
你说中心点是什么意思？

293
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,680
Man,I cannot figure this out.
我就是转不出来

294
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,860
Yeah, because it's not 1985.
因为现在不是1985年

295
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,490
You guys,guess what? I ditched a cop.
你们知道吗？ 我刚甩掉一个条子

296
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,060
-What? -What do you mean?
什么意思？

297
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,000
He caught me using his badge and he tried to bust me.

How far did he chase you?
他追了你多远？

300

Well,he didn't really. He just picked up his badge and stood there.
其实没追 他捡起警徽之后就杵在那里

301
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,680
Maybe we'll see you on World's Most Boring Police Chases.
也许你会上 “史上最无趣警匪追逐战”

302
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,490
-Why did you run? -I had to.
你为什么要跑？ 我非跑不可

You know, impersonating a cop is like a Class E felony.

Two to four years minimum. I am not going back to that hellhole.
2到4年的重罪 我才不要回那个苦窑

If I can just get it to pivot...

...we'll be back on track.

-Rach,can I get some help please? -Yeah.

Turn it off! Turn it off!
快关掉

309
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,320
Maybe the firemen can help us move the couch when they get here.
也许消防队员可以帮你搬

310
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,250
-Wait,wait,wait. -It's a new couch! It's a new couch!

319
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,660
You didn't give me advice. You gave me a pickup line.
你给的不是忠告，是搭讪词

320

I told her I wanted to build a foundation and be friends first.
我一说要建立基楚，先当朋友

325
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,970

I do! I do! I do!

他居然找到我了 天哪，你会坐牢吗？

If I go down, you guys go down with me.
我要死也要拖你们下水

好，你可以逮捕我 但你抓不到我的把柄

但我别无选择 这是职责所在，你沤獍桑

Maybe I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
这样吧，我今天不捉你 就说我来了，但你不在

I'd love it if I weren't here!
我不在就太好了

I didn't see that coming. You're asking me out.
