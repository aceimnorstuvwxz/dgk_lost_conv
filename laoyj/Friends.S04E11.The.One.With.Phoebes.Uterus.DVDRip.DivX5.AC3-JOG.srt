00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,850
Oh! I didn't know that you did pot.
我不知道你会做…锅子

138
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,150
Mostly nudes. It combines my two passions: pottery and erotica.
对，大多没穿衣服 结合陶艺和色情这两种爱好

139
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,290
Erottery!
就叫做“陶情”吧

140
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,660
Thanks for coming out to see me.
谢谢你来看我

141
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,890
I thought it'd be a good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.
我只是觉得生小孩这件事 还是当面聊比较好

142
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,360
I don't think it's a good idea.
菲比，我觉得这样不妥

143
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,070
Why not?
为什么？

144
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,570
You'd be giving up a baby.
因为你最后得要送走孩子

145
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,570
And I really don't
我不知道…

146
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I don't know if anything I said...
不知道要怎么说...

147
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,950
...would make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.
...你才会懂 送走孩子会有多么痛苦

148
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,922
所以…

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,690
No,no,I understand the pain. Don't hurt the puppy!
不…我了解那种痛苦 不要伤害小狗

150
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,090
No,no. The puppy is yours.
不是啦…这小狗是你的了

151
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,560
-I get a puppy? -But for only three days.
我有小狗？ 对，但只能拥有三天

153
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,200
Why?
为什么？

154
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,700
I realize I don't have any right to start getting parent-y on you now.
我知道我现在没有权力 突然搬出妈妈的脸孔跟你说教

155
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,150
Look at me and not the puppy. It's very important.
菲比，麻烦别看小狗 看着我，我要说重要的事

156
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,320
I know what I'm talking about.
我知道我在说什么

158
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,380
I gave up two babies.
我送走过两个孩子

159
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,390
I only wish I had someone who'd given up babies that told me...
只希望当时能有前辈告诉我

160
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,530
...how terrible it is.
送走自己的小孩会有多痛苦

161
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,670
I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
早知道就别先把小狗给你

162
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,030
That's okay. No,we're listening.
没关系，我专心听你说

163
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,040
It'd be something you'd regret every day for the rest of your life.
我只是觉得送走孩子后 你会每天后悔直到死掉

164
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,510
So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy...
你到时送走这条小狗的痛苦

165
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,190
...it'd be a million times harder to give up a child.
还不及送走孩子的百万分之一

166
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,830
Okay,fair enough. Three days.
好，很合理，就养三天

167
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,330
Oh,it's time to take my ass out of the kiln.
该把屁股拿出烤窑了

168
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,140
Could you sit there? I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.
你能不能坐对面？ 我帮朋友罗斯留了位置

169
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,640
You mean Dr. Geller?
你是说盖勒博士？

170
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,040
Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.
博士？我不知道他有这绰号

171
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,150
Oh,he won't sit here.
他才不会坐这里呢

172
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,510
Only people in white coats sit there.
穿白袍的都会坐在那里

173
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,690
Only people in blue blazers sit here.
穿蓝色外套的只能坐这里

174
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,090
-How come? -That's just the way it is.
为什么这样？ 就是这样

176
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,160
That's crazy.
岂有此理

177
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,700
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world: a world without lab coats and blazers.
或许在不分蓝白的完美世界里 这样就会是岂有此理

178
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,270
But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now.
但你不是活在完美世界 而且这里是博物馆

179
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,070
See that scientist?
看到那戴眼镜的科学家没？

180
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,240
He and I used to play together in grade school,but now....
想当年我们念小学还是玩伴 但现在呢？

181
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,740
Peter! Hey,Peter!
彼德！…

182
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,990
It's me! Rhonda,from P.S. 129?
我是朗妲，我们是同届的啊

183
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,450
I shared my pudding with you,man!
亏我把布丁分你吃过

184
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,660
I gave you my Snack Pack!
我还把点心棒送给你吃

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,830
See? He pretend he don't even hear me!
看到没？他假装通通没听到

186
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,930
Everyone's pretending they don't hear you.
我想大家都在假装没听到

187
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,310
I don't know about your jackets and separate tables...
我是不知道什么制服 还有你们分桌吃饭的事啦

188
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,000
...but Ross is my friend.
不过罗斯是我的死党

189
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,440
And if I save him a seat, he will sit in it.
若我帮他留了位置 我告诉你，他一定会坐

190
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,780
Here! I saved you a seat!
罗斯…来这里坐 我帮你留了位置

191
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,490
I'm cool here. I'll catch up with you later.
我坐这里就好了 之后再去找你聊

192
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,530
This is saved.
这个位置有人坐了

193
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,930
Gift shop.

You do what you got to do.

196
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,690
The scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
不只是我而已 科学家和导览员从来不坐一起

197
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,580
Whatever.

198
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,600
It's like that everywhere. Mon,back me up.
这种情况到处都有 摩妮卡，帮我说说话啊

And the chefs eat with the other chefs?
厨师和厨师吃饭，对吧？

201

我是自己躲在巷子里吃 因为大家都恨我

好，瑞秋，你上回 和运货员一起吃饭是何时？

203

I've never had lunch with the shipping clerks...
你听我说，我不常跟他们吃饭

...but it's totally different. They're not allowed in the executive cafeteria.
但这完全是两码子事 因他们不能进主管的自助餐厅

It's no big deal.

You wear a white coat. I wear a blue blazer.
你穿白袍，我穿蓝色外套

I understand,you know?

感觉像是“我了解，无所谓”

“老天 那砘锶盟欲仙欲死”

I was looking at it upside down.
反过来看会有误差嘛

255
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,220
Well,you know,sometimes that helps.
有时候反过来也不错

256

Most guys will hit one,two,three and then go to seven and set up camp.
男人大多数爱抚过一、二、三 就直接跳到第七个，结束比赛
