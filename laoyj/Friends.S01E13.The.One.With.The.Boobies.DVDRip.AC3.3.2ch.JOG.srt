Why? Why would l? Why?

I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?
我不知道,或许自信心不足

111
00:08:38,75 --> 00:08:43,38
Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe
或许是弥补你让你妹相形见绌的愧疚

112
00:08:43,58 --> 00:08:46,08
Wait! Go back to that "sibling" thing.

You could've sabotaged your marriage...

Yeah. No,that's not what I was saying.

I thought you were on my side.
多年来我以为你支持我

120
00:09:15,05 --> 00:09:18,68
But maybe you sucked up to them so they'd favor you.
但或许你婚姻失败目的是想巴结爸妈 让他们更心疼你

感觉真奇怪 你没说“不,谢了,时候不早了”
