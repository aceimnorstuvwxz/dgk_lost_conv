It is nothing like The Hobbit.

Anybody want a cruller?

But this is a two-line part!

83
00:05:10,71 --> 00:05:12,83
It's like taking a step backwards.

I'm not gonna do this.

...but it would've made a nice gift for you.

Sweetie,we've got to go.

不，为什么我们做什么事 都得照你的时间表来呢？

99
00:06:08,40 --> 00:06:11,66
Actually,it's the movie theater that has the timetable.
事实上，我们照的是 电影院的时间表

100
00:06:12,43 --> 00:06:14,59
It's so you don't miss the beginning.
这样我们才不会错过开头啊

101
00:06:15,87 --> 00:06:20,81
This isn't about the movie theater. This is about you stealing my wind.

我不是很懂 但她…她蛮不高兴的

117
00:07:33,35 --> 00:07:36,15
This is why I don't date women who read.
所以我不跟看书的女人约会

118
00:07:39,12 --> 00:07:40,45
