Check it out,this is unbelievable!

Joey's been holding his breath for almost four minutes.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,510
You trying to kill me?
猪头，你想闷死我啊？

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,550
-I want to ask you something. -What?
菲比，我问你一件事 什么事？

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,170
Since I'm moving out, and you're so beautiful...
既然我要搬出去 你又这么美丽…

6
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,650
how about I move in with you?
我搬去跟你住如何？

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,090
That would be great, but what do we do about Denise?
太好了，但是狄妮丝怎么办？

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,260
-Who's Denise? -My roommate.
谁是狄妮丝？ 我的室友

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,420
Your roommate?
你有室友？ 

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,660
Yes,Denise. Denise!
对，狄妮丝，狄妮丝

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,800
What is with the secrecy,Phoebe?
你干嘛这么神秘？ 

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,060
What about Denise? She cute?
这个狄妮丝可爱吗？

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,000
How can you have a roommate that we don't know about?
我们怎么会不知道你有室友？

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,510
Because you never listen to what I say.
也许是因为都没人在听我讲话 

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,840
I talk about her all the time. Denise!
我一天到晚提起她，狄妮丝！

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,350
I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place.
瑞秋，我在想 我那里会多一个房间

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,720
-That's true. -Move in with me.
没错 你何不搬来跟我住？

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,050
We can stay up late talking, and watch movies.
多好啊 我们可以熬夜谈心，看电影

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,450
You know about naked Thursdays, right?
你知道赤裸星期四的规定吧？

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,430
Yeah,yeah. I think I'll find my own place.
我还是自己找房子好了

21
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,630
Hey! I thought naked Thursdays was just our thing,man.
我以为赤裸星期四 是我们的专利

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,340
The One With Ross' Denial

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,510
What did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
你没办注销，瑞秋怎么说？

24
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,870
Oh,that.
那个啊

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,240
She took it really well.
她还蛮平静的

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,220
-You didn't tell her,did you? -No.
你没说对吧？ 没有

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,690
Because you're in love with her.
当然没有，因为你爱她

28
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,120
I am not in love with her. She was upset about having to move out.
我并不爱她 她在为搬家的事难过

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,230
If she knew we were still married, she'd have been more upset.
所以我没说，免得她更不开心

30
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,760
So I comforted her. As a friend.
我只以朋友的身分安慰她

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,470
You "comforted her"?
什么叫安慰她？ 

32
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,400
Nothing. I just gave her a hug.
也没什么，我抱了抱她

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,370
A classic sign of love, the hug.
拥抱正是爱的表示

34
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,040
It's also a sign of friendship.
也是友情的表现

35
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,180
Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson."
在这里不是，痴情男

36
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,740
It was a hug. Okay?
那只是个拥抱

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,410
A simple hug.
一个单纯的拥抱

38
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,520
I was a friend being a friend to a friend.
我只是对朋友尽朋友的心意

39
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,820
Use the word "friend" more.
你太强调朋友了

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,890
Did you,or did you not, smell her hair?
告诉我，你有没有闻她的头发

41
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,320
Smell her hair?
闻她的头发？

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,290
What if I did?
如果有呢？

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,460
Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out of her head.
九成的女性费洛蒙散发自头部

44
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,430
That's why women are shorter.
所以女人都比较矮 

45
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,300
So that men will fall in love when they hug them.
好让男人在拥抱时爱上她们

46
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,440
Come on,Ross, you're a scientist.
拜托，你是科学家耶

47
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,040
I was hugging her as a friend.
我是以朋友的身分抱她

48
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,610
It's not my fault her hair got in my face.
又不是我把脸埋进她的头发 

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,720
She's got a lot of it, and it smells all... all...
她的头发很多，有一股…

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,380
coconutty.
椰子香

51
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,560
What? It doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel.
怎样？那不代表我对她有感觉 

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,390
Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts.
或许我是对椰子有感觉

53
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,730
Okay,but be careful. Rachel's not in the same place you are.
好，随你怎么说 但你要小心 瑞秋的心情和你不同

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,830
If the place you're referring to is being in love...
如果这个心情是指爱情 

56
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,740
she is in the same place as me, because I am not in that place.
那她和我的心情一样 因为我不是那个心情

58
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,640
I didn't understand that.
好，我听不懂

59
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,740
Maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love.
或许因为你讲的是爱的秘语

60
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,820
-A guy just called for you. -Who was it?
刚才有你的电话 是谁？

61
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,220
I don't know. How about "Thanks for taking the message"?
我哪知？ 你怎么不谢我帮你留言？

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,890
When you move in...
等你搬进来 

63
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,630
Rachel's room will be empty. Let's talk about what to do with it.
瑞秋的房间就空出来了 要不要来讨论怎么利用？

64
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,770
I think we should have a beautiful guest room...
好啊 我想我们应该弄个漂亮的客房

65
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,240
with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with fresh flowers.
有红木雪橇床 床头桌上永远插着鲜花

66
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,810
And comment cards so people could tell us how great their stay was.
再摆张卷盖式书桌放上留言卡 让客人表达他们的开心之类的

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,250
I really haven't thought about it that much.
我还没有想太多

68
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,890
Well,I like that idea... obviously.
我喜欢这个主意…当然喜欢

69
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,850
I was thinking maybe... maybe it could be a game room.
我在想或许可以弄个游戏房

70
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,530
You can buy old arcade games, like Space lnvaders and Asteroids...
我们可以买旧的游戏机 像太空入侵者和小行星

72
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,760
for $200. The real ones. The big,big,big ones!
只要2百元，正港又大台

73
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,800
No.
不要

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,030
You mean "No" as in:
你的意思是“天哪，钱德”

75
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,350
"What an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it."
“好有趣的主意” “我们先讨论再全盘否定”

76
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,710
I'm sorry.
对不起，当然啦

77
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,320
Interesting idea. But no.
很有趣的主意 谈过了，但是不要

78
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,110
So that's it?
就这样？

79
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,060
I just don't think arcade games go in a beautiful guest room...
漂亮的客房不适合放游戏机

80
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,460
filled with antiques.
漂亮的客房里会有很多古董

81
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,190
Which is why Asteroids is perfect. It's the oldest game.
所以小行星才适合 那是最古老的游戏机

82
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,030
What's wrong with a beautiful guest room?
你对漂亮的客房有什么意见？

83
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,230
I'm not against it.
我没有意见 

84
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,240
Especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away.
尤其是我们认识的人都住在方圆数公尺内

86
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,740
Are you mocking me?
你在嘲笑我吗？

87
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,470
No,I'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room.
我没有在嘲笑你 或是你漂亮的客房

88
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,984
怎么了？

89
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,880
Monica and l had a stupid fight.
没事，摩妮卡和我吵架了

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,530
You're still moving in together, right? My ad came out today.
但你们还是要同居吧？ 我的广告今天出来了

91
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,060
"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker,nonugly."

93
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,170
I figured it'd be more interesting to have a female roommate.
我想说在你之后 换个女室友会蛮有趣的

94
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,040
Someone I could learn from. Someone who's different than me.
一个我可以学习 和我不一样的人

95
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,880
And what's more different than me, a guy who's not 19...
谁和我最不一样？ 年过19的男人

96
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,550
than a girl who is 19?
还是19岁的女孩？

97
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,590
Not just a hatrack,my friend.
我可不是草包

98
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,590
Phoebe,I have to ask you..
菲比，我想问… 

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,350
I'm swamped right now.
嘘…我正在忙

100
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,930
You're just staring into space.
你只是在发呆

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,930
I'm trying to move that pencil.
我想移动那支铅笔

102
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,970
-This one? -lt worked!
这支吗？ 成功了

103
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,440
Phoebe,this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.
菲比，找房子真是恶梦

104
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,450
Anything I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. Look.
我租得起的地方都有怪胎室友 你看嘛

105
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,120
"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker,nonugly."
“诚徵女性室友” “不抽烟，不丑”

106
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,860
That's probably some 12-year-old kid trying to get girls to call.
可能是想跟女生讲电话的小鬼

107
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,130
There's nothing. This city is full.
没房子了，纽约都住满了

108
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,390
Wait! Look at this!

"Two bedroom,two bath. Must be nonsmoker. Satan worshipers okay."
“两房两卫，不得抽烟” “拜撒旦者可”

-Rach,you still looking for a place? -Yeah,why?
瑞秋，你还在找房子？ 对，怎样？

112
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,610
This guy,Warren,from the museum is going on a dig for two years.
好，我们博物馆有个华伦 要去参与挖掘工作2年

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,260
He's got this great place he needs to sublet. You interested?
他有个漂亮的家要转租 你有兴趣吗？

114
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,920
Great! I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren!
听起来好棒 我愿意住华伦家，我爱华伦

等等，是他跟你要我的裸照吗

That doesn't matter, he won't be there!
反正他要走了

117
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,300
-Thank you! -Don't thank me.
谢谢你 别谢我

118
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,140
Thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago...

119
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,300
killing, but perfectly preserving, an entire civilization.

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,480
Here's Warren's number.

You love her again. You re-love her.

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,270
I do not re-love her.

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,140
I can't believe you won't just admit it.

Promise me you won't do anything stupid.

137
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,930
I would love to live with you. That's great. Thank you.
我求之不得，太好了，谢谢你

138
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,540
I'm just glad I could help you out.
有帮到你就好

139
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,940
Wow,I'm so happy for you guys. This is so, so, not stupid.
我真替你们高兴 这真是非常的不蠢

140
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,210
Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.
罗斯，这对我太重要了

141
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,520
I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me. You're my hero.
我差点就要流落街头 你救了我，你是我的英雄

142
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,590
Hero? I don't know. Well, all right.
说英雄就太…好吧

143
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,930
I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.
我要去告诉摩妮卡 她的哥哥有多棒

144
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,200
Oh,please.
别这样

145
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,940
You're gonna say things now, aren't you?
你又有话要说了吧？

146
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,380
No. No,I won't.
没有

147
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,890
But I should tell you this.
但是我告诉你

148
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,050
The same thing happened to my roommate,Denise.
我的室友狄妮丝就是这样

149
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,490
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her.
她搬去跟一个偷娶她的人住 

150
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,490
He said he didn't love her, but he really did. And it just blew up.
他嘴上说不爱，其实很爱她 他嘴上说不爱，其实很爱她

152
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,430
And that's how she ended up living with me.
后来事情爆发 所以她才搬来跟我住

153
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,090
Okay, that's a lie.
好吧，我骗你的

154
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,610
-You don't have a roommate. -Denise!
你才没有室友 狄妮丝

155
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,170
No one ever listens to me!
都没有人听我讲话

156
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,620
Listen,I'm sorry about before. I don't need a game room.
刚才很抱歉，我不需要游戏房

157
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,160
I only played those games because I couldn't get girls. Now I can get..
我以前把不到马子才去打游戏 现在我把得到了…

159
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,190
Now I have you.
现在我有了你

160
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,990
No,not that I think I have you...
我并不是把你当成 

161
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,570
or think of you as property in any sort of way. I see women....
或想成一件财产 我对女人… 

162
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,330
Stop it,Chandler.
别再说了

163
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,940
I'm sorry too.
我也很抱歉

164
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,270
-Really? -Yeah. Oh,yes.
真的？ 对，当然

165
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,520
We can think of something to do with the room together.
我们不必弄一个客房 我们可以一起想要怎么利用

166
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,550
Great idea. We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
好主意 要做到皆大欢喜很容易

167
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,220
Totally.
就是啊

168
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,960
-We don't have to decide now. -Good.
我们不必现在想 好

169
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,630
Let's think about changes we can make in the living room.
不如来想想客厅要怎么变化

170
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,160
Changes?
变化？

171
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,900
We'll have to move some furniture to make room for my chair.
对，我们得移动一些砭 来放我的椅子

172
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,610
You're bringing the Barcalounger over here?
你要把懒人椅搬过来？ 

173
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,310
Is that a problem?
有问题吗？

174
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,380
It's just that they're a set and should stay together.
那是一组的，应该摆在一起

175
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,750
That's cool. I'll bring them both over.
那好，那我就都搬过来

176
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,420
You're taking them away from their home.
你是要它们离开老家

177
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,220
I get it. I get nothing. Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours.
好，我懂了，这里没我的东西 只有你的东西

178
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,930
I'll get up in the morning,put on your clothes and go off to work!
我早上起床就穿上你的衣服 然后去上班

179
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,830
Yeah,that's it. Everything will be mine. Nothing will be yours.
没错，这里只有我的东西 没有你的，这是我说的

180
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,170
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.
拜托！我是在讲懒人椅

181
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
It doesn't match. Where will it go?
它跟这里不搭，你要摆哪里？

182
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,510
In the game room!
游戏房里

183
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,010
It is not my fault your chairs are incredibly ugly.
你的椅子丑到爆又不是我的错

184
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,680
That's fine.
好

185
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,180
I won't bring the chairs. I won't bring anything!
我不搬椅子过来 我什么都不搬过来

186
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,850
I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place!
我可不想破坏老奶奶家的调调

187
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,360
Everything on your application looks really good.
你的条件看起来很好 

188
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,330
Just one last question.
最后一个问题

189
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,760
Will your friends be over here, partying and hanging out?
你和你朋友 会不会常来这里狂欢聚会？

190
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,930
Don't worry. I'm not a party girl.
放心，我不太爱玩

191
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,410
Don't just be blurting stuff out.
别想都不想就说 

192
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,540
I want you to really think about your answers.
我要你想清楚再答

193
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,780
Call off the roommate search. Hi. I'll be living here.
你不必找室友了 你好，我要住在这里

194
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,440
Ignore him. He's just some guy who wants the apartment.
别理他，他很想住进来 

195
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,820
But he's not going to get it.
但我不会选他

196
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,790
You took down the shower curtain?
你干嘛把浴帘拿掉？

197
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,760
That thing was a hazard!
那个东西很危险

198
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,560
I'm very safety conscious.
我很注重安全

199
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,500
I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
我正在清一些空间给你 

200
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,770
Thanks.
谢谢

201
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,850
But listen,Monica and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
但我刚去找摩妮卡 她和钱德大吵一架不同居了

202
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,080
What do you mean, not moving in? They're still moving in, right?
什么叫不同居了？ 他们还是要同居吧？

203
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,820
No, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
不，他们为了怎么利用空房 大吵一架

204
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,490
Over a stupid room?
就为了一个烂房间？

205
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,300
I feel kind of bad for them,but now I don't have to move in here!
我也有点替他们可惜 却又很高兴不必搬过来了

206
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,190
Oh, no. Yeah, that part's great.
没错，这一点的确很棒

207
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,030
What's all this about you guys fighting?
你们两个是在吵什么？

208
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,670
Is this really over a room?
真的就为了一个房间？ 

209
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,280
That is so silly.
真是太傻了

210
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,780
-We can handle this. -Apparently not.
罗斯，我们自己可以摆平 显然不行

211
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,120
And I can't stand by and watch two people I care about so much...
我不能坐视两个我关心的人 

212
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,520
be hurt by something that is so silly.
为了这么傻的事伤感情

213
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,800
Enough of the silliness.
别再傻了

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,560
Tell her to stop being silly.
你叫她别傻啊

215
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,134
好

216
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,700
Two very good points.
双方都有理

217
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,400
I've known you both a long time.
我认识你们两个很久了

218
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,240
And I've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy...
你们在一起之后 

219
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,750
as you've been since you got together.
比以前快乐一百万倍

220
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,480
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
你们真的要为了一个房间 放弃这一切？

221
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,850
That is so silly.
多傻啊

222
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,320
What's more important,love...
什么比较重要 爱情...

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,660
or silliness?
还是傻气？

224
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,530
Well,we are fond of the silliness.
我们喜欢傻气 

225
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,670
But we also have a soft spot for the love.
但面对爱情也会心软

226
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,070
-Love is the best medicine. -That's "laughter."
爱是万灵药 欢笑才是吧？

227
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,570
-Why do you do it? -I don't know.
你为什么这样？ 我不知道

228
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,220
Now, Chandler, you want to live with Monica, right?
钱德，你想跟摩妮卡住吧？

229
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,680
Yeah, I do.
对

230
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,290
And,Mon,you want to live with Chandler?
摩妮卡，你想跟钱德住吧？ 

231

Yes.
对

232
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,960
A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
很好，口头契约 在纽约州有约束力

233
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,870
So I understand you're looking for a place?
我听说你在找房子

234
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,540
No, I'm staying put.
不，我不搬了

235
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,720
I was going to offer you my apartment.
我本来打算找你来我家住

236
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,380
Why? Where you going?
为什么？你要去哪里？

237
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,060
I don't know.
我不知道

238
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,030
瑞秋

239
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,630
You won't believe it.
说了你一定不信 

240
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,820
Monica and Chandler are moving in again.
钱德和摩妮卡又要同居了

241
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,970
That's great news, right? I mean, for them, right?
真是太好了… 对他们来说，对吧？

242
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,670
But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
不过好处是我们又能当室友了

243
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,110
Yeah. You know,about that....
是啊，关于这件事…

244
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,850
I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything...
我很感谢你主动提议，但是…

245
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,750
but don't you think it'll be weird?
你不觉得会很怪吗？

246
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,150
Why? Why would it.... Why would it be weird?
为什么？为…为什么会怪？

247
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,620
Well, you know, because of us.
因为我们

248
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,770
Because of our history.
因为我们的过去

249
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,830
No!
不会 不会吗？

250
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
No,no!
不会

251
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,760
It would only be weird if we were still in "that place."
除非我们还余情未了

252
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,200
Are you still in that place?
你还余情未了吗？

253
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,010
-No,not at all. -Good. Me neither.
一点也没有 很好，我也没有

254
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,950
So it's not a problem.
那就没问题了 

255
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,280
We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
我们只是刚好是室友的朋友

256
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,950
Okay, but eventually you and I will be dating.
好，但我们迟早会约会

257
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,850
Really? We are?
是吗？

258
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,530
Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend and you'll have a girlfriend.
是啊，我会有男朋友 你会有女朋友

260
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,200
That'd be great.
那太好了

261
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,500
But if you think it'll be okay, we'll just work out a system.
不过如果你觉得无所谓 我们就想一套做法

262
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,300
It'll be like in college. I'll hang a sign on the door:
就像大学时代 我在门上挂个牌子

263
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,240
"Come back later. I'm getting lucky."
“暂且回避，正在炒饭”

264
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,090
Yeah,I didn't think of that.
我想都没想过

265
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,090
So are you sure about this whole moving-in thing?
你们确定要住在一起？

266
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,990
It's a really big step. And what's the rush?
这是很大的进展，急什么呢？

267
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,600
That's very funny.
真好笑

268
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,600
He's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness.
他在装傻 因为他知道我们喜欢傻气

269
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,180
No,I'm serious. Think about it. You move in.
我是说真的，你们想想 你搬进来

270
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,250
You start fighting over game rooms. Next thing you know, you break up.
你们为了游戏房的事吵架 接下来就会分手

271
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,520
It was just a stupid fight about a room.
