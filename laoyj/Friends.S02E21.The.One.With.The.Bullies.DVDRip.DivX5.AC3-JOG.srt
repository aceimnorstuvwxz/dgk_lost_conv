Let's take this outside.

"Let's take this outside?"

140
00:09:02,10 --> 00:09:04,30
Who talks like that?
谁会这么说？

141
00:09:04,61 --> 00:09:08,94
The guy who's about to kick your ass talks like that.
即将要痛扁你们的人会这么说

142
00:09:09,21 --> 00:09:10,77
You had to ask.
谁叫你多嘴呢

143
00:09:14,55 --> 00:09:16,88
Okay,okay,look. See...
好吧…

144
00:09:17,15 --> 00:09:21,14
...the thing is,we're not gonna fight you guys.

145
00:09:22,32 --> 00:09:23,52
Here's the deal.
那么这样好了

146
00:09:23,72 --> 00:09:28,66
You won't have to,so long as you never ever show your faces here again.
你们保证从今以后 不踏入这家咖啡厅

147
00:09:34,10 --> 00:09:36,83
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
你太早把阿刚抬出来了吧

148
00:09:43,18 --> 00:09:45,44
Hey,Pheebs,I think you're good to go.

150
00:09:49,35 --> 00:09:50,48
What's the matter?

151
00:09:50,69 --> 00:09:53,52
I just think that this was a really bad sign.
我是觉得这是个很不好的预兆

152
00:09:53,75 --> 00:09:56,78
Like the beast at the threshold.
我是说像门槛上的野兽啦

153
00:09:58,26 --> 00:10:03,09
It's just I have no family left, except for my grandmother.
我已经没有别的亲人了 除了我奶奶之外

154
00:10:03,33 --> 00:10:06,32
But let's face it,she's not gonna be around forever.
可是面对现实吧 她又不会永远都活着

155
00:10:06,53 --> 00:10:07,97
Despite what she says.
不管怎么说

156
00:10:09,64 --> 00:10:14,57
And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.
我有个除了在子宫里面 几乎没有说过话的姐姐

157
00:10:15,94 --> 00:10:17,97
I don't know. This is my real father...

...and I want things to be, like,just right.

I completely understand.

163
00:10:50,04 --> 00:10:51,71
What was that?

164
00:10:56,05 --> 00:10:58,88
I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
我猜现在门槛没有狗了

165

I want to buy five shares of SGJ. Now.

00:11:11,27 --> 00:11:13,20
"Time is money,my friend?"
“时间就是金钱”？

169
00:11:13,40 --> 00:11:15,53
You missed "Takes money to make money"...
“时间就是金钱”…

170
00:11:15,74 --> 00:11:19,70
...and "Don't make me come down there and kick your Wall Street butt."
…还有，“别逼我 过去踢你的华尔街屁股”

171
00:11:20,31 --> 00:11:23,71

How did you make $17?

174

Well,my financially challenged friends...

...I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
…我用我的钱分别买了些 CHP跟ZXY股

176
00:11:37,46 --> 00:11:38,65
How come those?
你怎么选的？

177
00:11:38,93 --> 00:11:43,45
Well,CHP because I used to have a crush on Erik Estrada.
CHP是因为我暗恋过 “加州公路巡警”的奇普

178
00:11:44,60 --> 00:11:48,00
And ZXY because I think it sounds "zexy."
ZXY 那是听起来很“劲”感啊

179
00:11:48,97 --> 00:11:50,96
What happened to MEG?

MEG was good for me,but I dumped her.

183
00:12:07,86 --> 00:12:08,95
How's the dog?

我跟兽医谈好了 纽约州的人真好

He said the little fella's gonna be okay,and I can get him tomorrow.
他说那个小砘锊换嵊形侍 明天我可以去接它了

But he did have to have a bunch of stitches.
可是他必须帮它缝好多针

188

I don't want to meet my father over the phone.
我不想在电话上跟我爸相认

192
00:12:39,65 --> 00:12:42,18
What will I say, "Hi,I'm the daughter you abandoned.
我该跟他先什么呢？ “我是菲比被你抛弃的女儿”

00:12:42,46 --> 00:12:44,95
Oh,by the way,I broke your dog."

... be too long with the phone.

-This is better than the coffeehouse. -Absolutely.

How come it's not mixing with the water?

The package says to keep it moving.

就算被扁又怎么样？也许每个 男人都得经历过一次这个…

226
00:14:58,83 --> 00:15:01,82
Like a rite of passage or something.
成人式之类什么的

227
00:15:02,10 --> 00:15:05,12
Couldn't we just lose our virginities again?
