142
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,890
I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
菲比居然跟罗夫罗兰亲热 

143
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,330
I'm so jealous!
真是忌妒死了

144
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,800
Hi,I'm Chandler, your live-in boyfriend.

145
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,010
Chandler, please. Come on.

146
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,680
Look at him.

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,650
Well,I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish.

148
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,510
Here.

149
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,920
Who's the silver fox?
那个银发老帅哥是谁？

150
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,580
That is your make-out buddy. Don't you recognize him?
那是你的亲热对象 你不认得吗？

151
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,750
Oh,wait.

"Phoebe, I love you. Kiss me, please."
菲比我爱你，吻我

153
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,470
That's not Ralph Lauren. It sounds like him,though.
那才不是罗夫罗兰 不过声音有像

154
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,670
-What? -Ralph doesn't look like that guy.
什么？ 罗夫跟他一点也不像

155
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,710
He's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a Hacky Sack..
他很年轻，长发落腮胡 背个大包包

156
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,980
Oh,my God. That's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy!
天哪，那不是罗夫罗兰 那是影印小弟肯尼

157
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,140
What?
什么？

158
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,990
I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren.
完了，我还跑去告诉我老板

159
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,490
If she finds out that I lied to her, she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!
要是她发现我骗她 一定会更讨厌我，菲比

160
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,220
Why would the copy guy say he's Ralph Lauren?
那个小弟为什么自称罗夫罗兰 

161
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,300
To get you to make out with him!
好骗你跟他亲热啊

162
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,630
This will make them look less white.
也许这件能压住你的白牙

163
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,800
Nope.
不行

164
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,880
Colors that don't work are...
好，没有用的颜色有

Do you wanna try this highlighter again?

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,990
No,I think it poisoned me a little.

168
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,100
The date starts in an hour. What am I'm gonna do?
离约会只剩1小时 我该怎么办

169
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,640
Maybe if your skin was lighter, your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
要是你的肤色白一点 牙齿就不会那么显眼

170
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh,great! So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
太好了，所以我去换肤就行了 谢谢你

171
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,310
If we put just a little bit of makeup on you..
我是说你可以化一点妆

172
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,020
Whoa!

173
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,520
We're not 13 anymore.
我们已经不是13岁了

174
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,520
This is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
只剩这个可行的办法

175
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,690
Won't she notice I have makeup on?
她不会发现我有化妆吗？ 

176
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,120
Half the guys out there have makeup on.
拜托，半数的男人都有化妆

177
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,660
What?

178
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,660
Half the people.. I mean.. Just try it and see.
半数的人，你就试试看嘛

179
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,170
I am not putting on makeup.
不要，我死也不化妆

180
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,870
Hello? Ross, could you put up some of these flyers for me?
太好了 罗斯，帮我帖几张传单好吗？

181
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,870
No! Demon! Demon!
魔鬼！魔鬼！

182
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,050
Our drawers will smell nice, and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
这样抽屉就会香香的 旧裤袜也没浪费

183
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,220
God forbid we throw out old underwear.
是啊，扔旧内衣会遭天打雷劈

184
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,120
You know what? I'm gonna go over to Joey's.
我要去乔伊那边

185
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,390
We've got to organize the wrapping paper.
我们还要整理包装纸抽屉

186
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,470
I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.
对，但我今天已经够女性化了

187
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,070
In fact, we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
再缝两个香氛袋 我们就要变成女同志了

188
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,410

今天的确很女孩子气 你说得对，抱歉

190
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,380
do kind of a "man" thing.
做男人做的事

191
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,980
You go over to Joey's and...

192
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,160
drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall.
去乔伊家喝啤酒槌墙壁

193
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,720

男人并非只会喝酒槌墙壁

194
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,590
When girls hang out,we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.

195
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,770
I'm sorry. We do.

Ross,I was wondering if..

Oh,my God! Where are all the men?

-Hi,Kim. -Hi,Rachel.

记得我昨天说的事吗？ 其实没那回事

You didn't cancel the fabric order?

Okay,two things didn't happen.

206
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,220
Remember I told you someone made out with Ralph Lauren?
我不是说有人在影印室 跟罗夫罗兰亲热？

207
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,920
Well,it turns out that's not true.
结果是假的

208
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,150
It's not true? That's interesting.
是假的？那就好玩了 

209
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,920
Because I checked. Only one keycard was used to access the copier...
因为我去查过 昨天午休时间...

211
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,900
yesterday during lunch, and that keycard belonged to you.
刷卡进影印室的 只有你一个

You think I made out with him?

214
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,260
Listen to me...
听着

215
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,440
sleeping with Ralph is not gonna get you my job.
要是你以为跟罗夫上床 就能坐上我的位子，你就错了

I don't want your job. I don't.
我不想坐你的位子，真的

217
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,450
This is a mistake. I didn't make out with him.
这真是天大的误会 我没跟他亲热，

218
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,590
Nobody made out with him. I didn't use my keycard yesterday.
没人跟他亲热 我昨天没用我的卡

220
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,290
I don't even know how to use my keycard.

221
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,680
-Hi,Ralph. -Hi,Kim.

Yeah. Nothing happened.

You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
刚才的情欲张力一触即发

224
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,460
After that, what could I do except become a chef?

Soon,I hope to open my own restaurant.

You're a really great listener.
你很善于倾听 

227
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,010
Most guys I go out with, they talk and talk.
我交往过的男人多半讲个不停

228
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,740
It's like, "Shut your mouth." You know?
听到后来真想叫他们闭嘴

229
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,910
I've been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you?

You got dead flowers!

Look,I am still Joey, okay?

但是她觉得不会有人蠢到 把影印小弟当成罗夫罗兰

What if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?
如果肯尼才是公司的首脑呢？
