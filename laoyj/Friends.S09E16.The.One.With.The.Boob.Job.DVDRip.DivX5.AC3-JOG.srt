Maybe we should've talked about this before.

a blond who always uses the toilet?

Except for once in the ocean.

所以他可能很怕我的身材会变形

“不要变大，你很完美了 不要再变大了”

My God, he sounded just like my high-school wrestling coach.
天啊，他听起来就像是 我高中的摔角教练

- I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler. - Yeah. If you don't, I will.
-我必须要跟钱德谈谈 -是啊，如果你不去，我会去

现在你跑来找我，是要取笑我吗？

我们出去在一起的时候被取笑 我可以理解，但是跑到我家来…

Wow. Are you still gonna move in with him?

I want to, but I wanted you to tell me that marriage really isn't that big a deal.
我想啊，但是我要你告诉我 结婚真的不算什么

-那不是你真正的感觉，对吧 -不是，我很抱歉

270

我知道那不是你想听的话 但是我没有办法说谎，我喜欢结婚

Seriously, you? "Divorce-o"?
真的吗？你这个“离婚专家”？

272
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If you have to call me a name, I'd prefer "Ross, the Divorcer." It's just cooler.
如果你要帮我取绰号，我比较喜欢 “罗斯，离婚王”，听起来较酷

273
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,240
Look, I know my marriages didn't exactly work out..
听着，我知道我的婚姻并没有成功

但我喜欢对另一个人做那种程度的承诺

275
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,650
And Carol and I had some good times before she became a lesbian.
在凯罗变成女同性恋之前 我们度过许多快乐的时光

276
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,550
And once afterward.

But, come on, I mean, living together will be great.
但是，别这样，住在一起也很棒阿

280
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,830
I mean, you guys have so much fun. And you love Mike.

So I can't do anything I like?!

Unbelievable.

钱德要你生小孩 但是不许你身材变形

293

294
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,270
- Hey, that's my husband. - All right.

但是那是真的你吗？ 你可以想像自己开着富豪汽车吗？

335
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,430
They are awfully boxy.
富豪汽车是太有有角了

336
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,130
People like me like stability and security. You don't.
像我这样的人才需要安定感 你不需要

337
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,670
And that's what's so incredible about you.

You got this wild and crazy life.

Hey, can I help?
嘿，需要帮忙吗？

Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs, maneuvered a narrow hallway..
我们爬了四层楼 好不容易通过狭窄的通道

343
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,530
dodged a rabid pit bull. But these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
再躲过一只狂犬病斗牛狗 但是最后这三尺路才是最崎岖的

344
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,820
You know, sometimes your words, they hurt.

Hey, where do you guys want this?

Yeah, seriously, because this is really heavy.
是啊，快点，因为真的很重

347
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,980
I mean, not for me, because I'm only pretending to hold it, but for these guys.
不是对我，因为我只是假装扶着 但是他们几个真的快被重死了

348
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:47,620
Just one last time on the marriage thing. There's no wiggle room? None at all?
最后再问你一次结婚的事 没有再思考的空间吗？一点都没有？

349
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,990
No, but you don't want to get married either, right?
没有，但你也不想结婚，不是吗？

350
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,390
Right.
没错

351
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,930
Except that I do want to get married.

352
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,260
Couldn't have had this conversation down at the truck, huh?

Someday.

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,500
And.. hernia.
还有…疝气

356
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:13,910
I haven't had a normal life. And I never felt like I was missing out on anything.
我从未有过正常的生活 而我也从没有觉得失去过什么

357
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,520
But it feels like now it's my turn to have some of the regular stuff.
但是总觉得好像 该轮到我拥有正常的东西了

358
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,090
Why didn't you say something before?
你为什么不早说呢？

359
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,890
I didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
我之前不确定我有多想要，而且我爱你 我想要跟你一起住

But I don't think I can.
但是我觉得我做不到

362
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,900
It was okay to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen.
当我不清楚未来时 我们是可以一起住的

363
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,600
But I can't move in knowing nothing is ever gonna happen.
但在知道将来什么事都不会发生之后 我就没办法了

364
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,330
I said to bring the cushions up first, but no.
我说先搬椅垫，你们就不要

365
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,710
Can we at least try living together? You might change your mind about marriage.
我们可以至少先试试同居吧？ 你或许会改变对婚姻的想法

366
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,910
Are you gonna change yours?
你会改变你的想法吗？

367
