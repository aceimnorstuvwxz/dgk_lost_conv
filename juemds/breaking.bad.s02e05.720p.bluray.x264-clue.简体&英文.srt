沃尔特  我们已经有了很大的进展
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

14
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:34,052
第一轮的治疗已经结束了
Here at the end of round one,

15
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,053
我保持谨慎乐观的态度
I'm going to recommend cautious optimism.

16
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,019
两个月以后  
We'll check back in two months,

17
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,041
我们会再看看你身体的反应  重新评估
See how you've responded, reassess,

18
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,023
然后决定你下一步的治疗方案
And decide our next move, if any.

19
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:46,050
就在你妻子的预产期  对吗
That's right around the time the baby's due, correct?

20
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,074
朝好的方面看吧
Try to think of this as good timing.

21
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:54,041
你会很会好起来的  会更像从前
You'll start feeling better soon, more like yourself,

22
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,026
头发也会长出来的
And your hair should start to come back.

23
00:02:57,089 --> 00:03:00,021
我已经有点习惯了这种光头造型了
I kind of gotten used to the old cue ball look.

24
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,065
应该说是流线型
I prefer to think of it as streamlined.

25
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:04,066
对  空气阻力小
Right. Aerodynamic.

26
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,061
不再困惑了吧
No more confusion?

27
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,087
当然不了
Absolutely none.

28
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,049
你们俩最近关系怎么样
How are you two holding up?

29
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:24,043
我是说  我们都挺忙的  不过
I mean, you know, we're busy, but...

30
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:25,050
我们处得不错
We're good.

31
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,083
当然
Absolutely.

32
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:29,048
一切都很好
It's all good.

33
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:38,014
不用保险支付  对吗
So, we're not going through an insurer. Is that correct?

34
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:39,054
没错  直接支付
Yes. Direct bill.

35
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,097
现在帮你把帐单打印出来
Just need to print it out for you.

36
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:23,009
我们不是讨论过会有现付折扣的吗
I thought we had discussed a cash discount.

37
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,011
没错  已经包括在内了
Absolutely. It's included.

38
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,027
提醒你一下
Just a reminder,

39
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:30,049
我们现在有个付款计划  
We do have a payment plan available,

40
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,087
你可能会感兴趣
should you be interested.

41
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,014
祝贺你
Congratulations.

42
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:43,033
谢谢你
Thank you.

43
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,084
那核磁共振怎么样
Then, what about the MRI?

44
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:01,009
你能给我解释一下
Can you please explain to me

45
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,023
诊断性和探索性的区别吗
the distinction between diagnostic and exploratory?

46
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:11,067
但是他的医生两个都订了
Yeah, but either way, his doctor ordered it.

47
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:17,036
当然要包括在内
It should be covered.

48
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:19,064
我会的  一式三份
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

49
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:24,005
很抱歉你没帮上什么忙
Well, I'm sorry you couldn't be of more help, too.

50
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,090
贱人
Bitch.

51
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,064
你和吸烟的人呆过吗
Been around someone who smokes?

52
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,096
医院帐单来了
The hospital bill came.

53
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:41,011
可真快啊
That was fast.

54
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:45,063
住院三天  总计一万三
Three-day stay: $13,000 and counting.

55
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:56,057
能让格雷琴和埃利奥特帮我们承担一点吗 
Is this something that Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

56
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:04,038
我知道那样做你会不乐意  不过
I know it's strictly your domain, but...

57
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,067
我相信他们愿意买单
They will. I'm sure they will.

58
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,086
我来处理
I'll handle it.

59
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:50,092
-给我塞拉曼加案子最新消息  -死了
- Bring me up to speed on Salamanca. - Dead.

60
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:52,099
-仅此而已  -完全没错
- Still? - Completely.

61
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,070
好的  很高兴你能来
Okay, then. Well, thanks for stopping by.

62
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,021
最近外面很平静
So things are quiet.

63
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:01,090
街上没什么人卖冰毒了
Not a lot of crystal on the streets right now.

64
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,095
很好
Good.

65
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:04,040
这种情况不会持续很久的 
That's not going to last.

66
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,098
等着看谁会重振旗鼓
Waiting to see who rallies the roaches now

67
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:07,075
现在屠库的生意很容易到手
 That his turf's up for grabs.

68
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:09,058
现在还没人接盘吗
No takers so far?

69
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:12,097
我们不断听到一个名字  海森堡
We keep hearing a name. Heisenberg.

70
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:15,052
最近几乎抓的小混混都提到这个名字
Lately, pretty much every dime-bagger we come across.

71
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:17,035
-海森堡  -对 
- Heisenberg? - Yeah, I know.

72
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:20,072
可能他会是下一个大毒枭
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

73
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,016
还是有人在秘密制造
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking

74
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,057
那些我们追查的冰毒
that big blue we keep finding.

75
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:27,076
无论如何  我们会继续跟进的
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

76
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,065
知道为什么鲨鱼在食物链的顶端吗  汉克
Know why sharks are at the top of the food chain, Hank?

77
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,097
因为它们有三排牙齿
'Cause they have three sets of teeth

78
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:37,099
能一口咬开任何东西吗
and will take a bite out of anything?

79
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:41,081
它们追踪上千英里
Some of those suckers travel thousands of miles

80
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,058
只为追捕自己的猎物
In pursuit of their prey.

81
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,042
对  我想我听说过
Yeah, I think I heard that.

82
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,093
你  就是一条大白鲨
You, my friend, are a great white.

83
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:53,027
觉得阿尔布开克联络处
How does Albuquerque Liaison,

84
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:56,067
三国边境封锁任务组怎么样
Tri-state Border Interdiction Task Force sound?

85
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:59,062
听上去像是升职
Like one hell of a promotion.

86
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,034
现在刚开始  我希望你能
As of the 1st, I want you to split your time

87
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,025
同时兼顾这里和埃尔帕索
Between here and El Paso.

88
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:05,073
谢谢你  长官
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

89
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,001
没有我你怎么办  格米
What you gonna do without me, Gomie?

90
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,003
当然是庆祝
Celebrate.

91
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:11,096
再也不用一周六天看到你这张丑脸了
I won't have to look at your ugly mug six days a week.

92
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:14,097
我可是智勇双全啊
Hey, buddy, I am the brains and the brawn.

93
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:15,094
我是全能王  
I'm the whole package.

94
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:17,065
还好没多吃东西  我都要吐了
I'm glad I didn't just eat.

95
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,024
真神奇他的头居然不会卡在门上
I'm surprised his head still fits through the door.

96
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:22,025
-想吃个饭庆祝下吗  -当然
- Wanna grab lunch? - Hell, yeah.

97
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,006
-因为是你请客  -就这么办

98
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,010
你们两个傻子到楼下等我
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

99
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,091
别迷路了
Try not to get lost on the way.

100
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,089
请讲  你好  里奇

102
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:36,062
当然  那可是埃尔帕索
Yeah, El Paso.

103
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,053
大人物来了
Here's the man.

104
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,010
恭喜你
Congratulations.

105
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:49,073
沙漠里两个  森林里两个
Hits two in the sand, two in the forest.

106
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:53,046
然后他说  四个一起上呀
And then he says, "Give me a four."

107
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:30,060
你吃了豹子胆  居然还敢回来
You got some nerve coming back here.

108
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,028
要么你就是比我想得还傻
Or you're even dumber than I thought.

109
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:36,004
可能都有吧
Maybe both.

110
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:47,035
赔给你拖车费  修理费
Balance for the tow, the repairs,

111
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:51,048
另外还有你大门的损失
And extra for, you know, damages and stuff to the gate,

112
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,052
和厕所
the toilet...

113
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:57,074
就跟我说的一样
Look, like I said,

114
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:01,008
我说话算话
My word is my bond.

115

要么就用你妹妹来抵
Your sister.

118
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:26,037
兄弟  我是认真的  我得把车停了
Dawg, I'm serious, all right? I got storage needs.

119
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:29,019
前面刮花了
And I got scratch up front.

120
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:31,068
我们可以  谈谈价钱
We could, you know, negotiate.

121
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:38,075
500元

-那就算了  -伙计  别这样

你的围墙太容易爬进来了
Your fence is too easy to climb.

130
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:03,035
停在里面  锁门  外加大门的优先使用权
Inside, padlocked, plus gate privileges.

131
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:06,072

- Come again? - Gate, in and out, privileges.

停在里面
Inside.

134
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,027
我不认识你  我也不认识杰克
And I don't know you. I don't know Jack.

135
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:30,030
那辆车卖吗
You selling?

136
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,010
9000块卖给你
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

137
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,046
那辆呢
What about that one?

138
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:48,020
开玩笑吧
Serious?

139
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:12,044
你是叫珍妮  对吗
It's Jane, right?

140
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:16,080
珍妮  这个地方太棒了
Well, Jane, I gotta say, this place is awesome.

141
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,085
真的吗  不是说套话
Really? Does it inspire awe?

142
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:21,004
不是  真的很棒
No. I mean, it's great.

143
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,093
就跟我想找的一样  我就这么个意思
Just what I've been looking for. That's what I meant.

144
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,043
我以前有一整栋房子
I had an entire house before,

145
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:26,025
整幢独立式别墅
Detached and all,

146
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,063
但我对打理草坪
But I was just tired of all the

147
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:30,047
房屋维护  还有摆设布置厌烦了
Lawn care and upkeep and whatnot.

148
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:34,047
百叶窗是新的  全都粉刷一新
Well, the blinds are new. Everything's been painted.

149
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,034
天啊
Jesus.

150
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:42,008
设施齐全
Utilities are included.

151
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,002
折叠式的  太好了
Stacking. Sweet.

152
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,065
-有有线电视吗  -已经装了天线了
- You got cable? - Already wired.

153
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:48,025
打个电话就能开通  很快捷
Just call to activate. High speed, whatever.

154
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,050
浴室  瓷砖很酷
Bathroom, cool tile.

155
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:52,084
卧室 
Bedroom.

156
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,065
很棒
Nice.

157
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,061
我很喜欢硬木地板
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

158
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:01,024
这么说  你有兴趣
So? You're interested?

159
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:02,094
毫无疑问
Definitely.

160
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,049
那你也接受NPNS
And you're good with NPNS?

161
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,078
对不起  你说什么
Sorry. What?

162
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,059
广告上说的  不准吸烟  不准养宠物
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.

163
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,034
你要吸烟就到外面去吸
You want to smoke, you do it outside.

164
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:16,053
-可以  不用担心  -按照惯例
- It's cool. No worries. - The usual drill.

165
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:19,049
W-2: 美国雇员必须填写的文件  包括年收入和缴纳的税

166
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:19,049
我要W-2表  最近的收入证明和雇主信息
I'll need a W-2 or a recent pay stub, current employer,

167
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,042
还有以前的地址什么的资料
Former address, you know, the yadda-yadda.

168
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:25,093
如果都没问题  我会打电话通知你
And if it's all copasetic, I'll call.

169
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,014
听我说
Look,

170
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:32,079
情况是  我可以
The thing is I can...

171
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,084
简直难以置信
Unbelievable.

172
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,099
最近我正处在过渡阶段
I'm currently in-between situations.

173
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:39,012
那我最近不准备出租
And I'm currently not renting.

174
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:41,062
我有钱  有能力付房租
I got the money and I'm totally good for it

175
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,073
一直都会有
For, like, ever.

176
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,064
别这样  唷  求你了  
Come on, yo, can you please,

177
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,060
就当是帮帮兄弟吧
Please just help a brother out?

178
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,043
唷  我老爸可没这么好说话
Yo, my dad's not really a "make exceptions" kind of guy.

179
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:51,078
-相信我  -你老爸
- Trust me. - Your dad?

180
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:54,014
房子是我老爸的  我帮他打理
Owns the place. I manage it.

181
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,004
我要的是白纸黑字
Pen on paper, that's what I need.

182
00:16:57,026 --> 00:16:59,026
否则你就到别的地方玩去
Or go run your game somewhere else.

183
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:01,066
别傻了  我无处可去了  这里就是我的家
Dude, I got nowhere else to go. This is it.

184
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,072
我真的没有骗你  相信我好吗
And I got no game, all right?

185
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,018
我只需要一个机会
I just need a chance.

186
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:13,065
我的家人把我赶了出来
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

187
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,062
很明显  我不太长进
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

188
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:19,088
再一次让他们失望了
Didn't meet their expectations, again.

189
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:22,088
所以我现在  无家可归了
So, you know, now I'm "gratis" or whatever.

190
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:23,046
但是知道吗  
But you know what?

191
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:27,024
我是个好人  工作努力
I'm a good person and I work hard.

192
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:29,082
我会每个月都准时付房租的
I will pay you every month and I will pay you on time.

193
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,029
我不会搞砸的  我发誓
I will not mess this up, okay? I swear.

194
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,017
现在租金涨价了
Rent just went up.

195
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:45,037
一个月多付一百
A hundred more a month.

196
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,004
那是现金价
That's the cash price.

197
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:52,087
你酷毙了  你不会后悔的
You rock. You won't regret this.

198
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,066
还有除了第一个和最后一个月
And, in addition to first and last,

199
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,005
我还想要你先多付两个月
I want two more months.

200
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,061
DBAA费用  恕不退款
DBAA fee, nonrefundable.

201
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:02,042
当然  DBAA  当然没问题 
Of course. No problem. DBAA. Obviously.

202
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,033
什么是DBAA
What's DBAA?

203
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:11,036
-"别做讨厌的人"  -我懂了
- "Don't be an asshole." - Gotcha.

204
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:13,054
我就住在隔壁
I live next door.

205
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:14,069
真的吗
Really?

206
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:17,029
别以为你有权利霸占着房子
And don't think for one second you have squatters' rights,

207
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,001
它不属于你
Because you don't.

208
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,087
如果你搞砸了  你就得马上滚蛋
If you blow this, I want you gone.

209
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,015
我了解你们这些人  我会把你一脚踹出门
I know guys that'll have your skinny ass

210
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:24,009
然后把东西扔出去  你连眼睛都来不及眨
Out back by the dumpster faster than you can blink.

211
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,042
我会帮你搞定这些  签名就行
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

212
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,042
顺便问问  你叫什么
Which is what, by the way?

213
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,067
杰西
It's Jesse.

214
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:36,082
杰西·杰克逊
Jesse Jackson.

215
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,075
真的吗
Seriously?

216
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,021
怎么了
What?

217
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:34,012
-你在干什么  -享受生活  还能干什么
- What are you doing? - Beating off. What's it look like?

218
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:37,072
我看到的确实是这样
That is, in fact, exactly what it looks like to me.

219
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:39,054
酿酒是一种艺术  玛丽
Brewing is an art form, Marie.

220
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,088
希望你也能懂得欣赏
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

221
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:43,050
这可是06年圣诞节的一批  快尝尝
Christmas, the batch of '06? Come on.

222
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:47,016
好吧  我直说吧
So, let me get this straight.

223
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,080
你居然请了病假躲在这里
You call in sick the day after receiving

224
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,067
还是在得到了梦寐以求的升职以后
A long-awaited career-boosting promotion

225
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,094
就为了在这里喝酒寻开心
So you can play October fest in your man cave?

226
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:01,046
我真的不明白  不懂
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

227
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:02,094
宝贝儿  放松点
Babe, relax.

228
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:06,065
别让我放松
Please, don't tell me to relax.

229
00:20:06,065 --> 00:20:08,094
-你知道我讨厌听到这话  -没错
- You know I hate that. - Right.

230
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:10,094
戴夫说我应该说出来
Dave said I should express that.

231
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:13,066
我想说的是一切都很好
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

232
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,008
我就想放天假
I can take a day.

233
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,058
没什么大不了的
No big deal.

234
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:22,009
现在  我可爱的小宝贝儿快走吧
Now, get that sweet ass out of here

235
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,025
不然我没法集中精力
So I can concentrate.

236
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:13,099
好吧  计划是什么
Okay, so what's the plan?

237
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:16,069
计划就是我们制毒
The plan is we cook.

238
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,013
我们为什么还要制毒
Why are we cooking

239
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:20,073
现在根本卖不出去
When we can't even move what we cook?

240
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,045
你觉得靠你自己能卖出去多少
Well, how much do you think you can sell on your own?

241
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:36,079
假设我白天制毒  你晚上去卖的话
Say if I cooked during the days and you worked the nights.

242
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,073
-傻瓜  -什么
- Dude. - What?

243
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,089
在屠库之前  那不是你的想法吗
Prior to Tuco, that was your plan, wasn't it?

244
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:44,049
我知道这比我们之前赚的少多了
I understand it'll be a fraction of what we brought in before,

245
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:46,060
但我们还有别的选择吗
But still, what choice do we have?

246
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,090
首先  别说什么我们
First of all, there's no "we."

247
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,063
你说的是我  一个人单干
You're talking me, solo,

248
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:53,019
在外面苦干还要担心吃子弹
Busting hump slinging shards.

249
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,086
我现在有案底了
I got profile now.

250
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:58,023
你不懂吗  有个禁毒署的家伙盯上我了
Don't you get that? A D.E.A.'s up my ass.

251
00:22:58,023 --> 00:22:59,038
我可不会为了那点小钱
I'm not exposing myself

252
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,054
把自己暴露了
to that level of risk for chump change.

253
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:04,013
-没门  -那你想怎么样
- No way. - Then what do you suggest?

254
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:06,050
我想我们谁
I don't think either of us are eager

255
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,092
都不会再想和屠库这样的家伙合作了
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

256
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,018
我现在有经济压力
I got bills, man.

257
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,031
你会有经济负担
You've got bills?

258
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,041
房租  唷  有责任了
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

259
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,083
我失去的远比得到的多 
I've already lost more than I have made,

260
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:25,004
我厌倦了整天在这儿胡搞乱来的日子
And I am tired of dicking around out here.

261
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:27,087
想知道我失去了多少吗
You want to know how much I've got left?

262
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:30,077
我第一轮的治疗结束了以后
After completing my first round of treatment

263
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:34,042
为世界上最贵的不在场证明买单
And financing the world's most expensive alibi?

264
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,056
什么都没了  都没了
Zero! Zip! Nothing!

265
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:38,091
之前的一切都付诸东流
I've got nothing to show for all of this.

266
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:40,032
一分钱都没能留给家人
Nothing for my family, which,

267
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,014
要是你还记得的话  那才是该死的重点
As you might remember, was the damn point!

268
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,034
但是现在认输并不是好主意
But seeing as throwing in the towel is not an option,

269
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:54,049
现在只有两条路可选
That leaves us with a total of two choices.

270
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,059
要么再和另一个杀人疯子做生意
We go into business with yet another homicidal lunatic

271
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,089
要么你和我开始
Or you and I start...

272
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:03,007
你尽你所能卖货
You selling whatever you can.

273
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:08,025
还有第三种选择
There's a third way.

274
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:11,058
是什么
And what would that be?

275
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,003
我们自己做屠库
We got to be Tuco.

276
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,012
省掉中间商  我们自己做经销
Cut out the middle man. Run our own game.

277
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:23,026
那你要怎么做
So you're going to, what?

278
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,035
用把猎刀把病毒吸进鼻子吗
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

279
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:29,038
把反对你的人都往死里打
You gonna beat your homies to death when they dis you?

280
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,031
听我说  我认识几个人
Look, I know some guys. All right?

281
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:33,073
我可以建立销售网络
I can create a network.

282
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:38,038
我们自己控制生产和分销
We control production and distribution.

283
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:39,070
我们从第一线退下来
That way, we stay off the front lines

284
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,084
不要自己去冒险
while moving some serious glass.

285
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:44,055
关键是能赚钱  对吗
The point here is to make money, right?

286
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:46,079
赚大把大把的钱
Sky-high stacks.

287
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:53,033
-难道我说的不对吗  -不是我不想这么干
- That's not the point? - No, I am not willing to do that.

288
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,063
谁说那关你的事了
Who said anything about you?

289
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,003
我不同意这个计划
I don't vote for this plan.

290
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:05,071
我不喜欢不认识的人加入我们的生意
I'm not comfortable bringing in unknown enties into our operation.

291
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:08,046
你没有投票的权利
You don't get to vote.

292
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:12,012
你再说一遍
I beg your pardon?

293
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,006
我们可是合作伙伴  记得吗
This is a partnership, remember?

294
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:17,024
我记得
I remember.

295
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:19,031
你制毒  我卖毒
You cook, I sell.

296
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:22,087
我们一开始就是这么分工的
That was the division of labor when we started all this.

297
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,038
现在也该这么保持下去
And that's exactly how we should have kept it.

298
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:27,099
这样我肯定不会让自己被锁在卡车里
'Cause I sure as hell didn't find myself locked in a trunk

299
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,062
还要被抢指着跪在地上等死
or on my knees with a gun to my head

300
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:33,074
在你这贪婪的老头来之前都不会
Before your greedy old ass came along, all right?

301
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,014
好吧  我承认还要学着慢慢来
All right, I will admit to a bit of a learning curve.

302
00:25:44,055 --> 00:25:47,060
可能我是太有野心了
And perhaps I was overly ambitious.

303
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:50,087
但无论如何  不会再发生了
But in any case, it's not gonna happen that way anymore.

304
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:54,028
非常正确  知道为什么吗
Damn straight. Know why?

305
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:56,083
因为我们这次按我的办法来
'Cause we do things my way this time,

306
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,013
否则我就不干了
or I walk.

307
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:05,096
你现在更需要我
You need me more than I need you.

308
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,051
沃尔特
Walt.

309
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:31,025
唷  瘦子皮特  最近怎么样
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?

310
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:33,069
康宝  见到你真好  
Eh, Combo. Good to see you.

311
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:35,086
欢迎光临寒舍
Welcome to my humble abode.

312
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:38,011
房子不错啊  伙计 
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

313
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,064
唷  猴子
Yo. Badger, hey.

314
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:43,048
房子真酷啊  伙计
Cool crib, man.

315
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:46,049
还有回声
It echoes.

316
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:51,078
我带你们虚拟地参观一下
Let me give you a virtual tour.

317
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:54,062
等离子彩电会挂在这里
Plasma is gonna go right here.

318
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:56,080
可能50英寸  壁挂式
Probably, like, a 50-inch wall-mounted.

319
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,020
等离子比液晶的牛多了  唷
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

320
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,022
才不  会烧屏的  唷
Nah. They burn in, yo.

321
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:04,050
但图画质好多了  黑色也很纯
But the picture's way sharper. Blacks are deeper, too.

322
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,004
马上三维电视机也要有了
They got 3-D coming out, like, any day now.

323
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:09,009
那才是我想要的
That's what I'm waiting for.

324
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:11,044
-A片  爽啊  -老天啊
- Porn, cuz! - Jesus.

325
00:27:11,044 --> 00:27:14,055
那可是三维立体的  感觉就在眼前
Like, 3-D ta-tas, like, right in your face.

326
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:15,050
我还要弄几个
I'm gonna get a couple of

327
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,095
零重力椅子放在这里
Those zero-gravity chairs for right here,

328
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:20,013
终极的观看享受
For your ultimate viewing comfort.

329
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,075
那可得花大价钱
Those are buck.

330
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:22,093
这里要弄得空旷些    
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.

331
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:24,082
亚洲现代风格
Very Asian-y, modern stuff.

332
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:27,041
风水  唷  我懂一些
Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.

333
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,037
我想放几支蜡烛
And I'm thinking, just a bunch of candles,

334
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:31,083
在这里弄个小喷泉什么的
Maybe one of those little fountain jobs right here.

335
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,020
肯定会超酷
It's gonna be chill.

336
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,063
女士们就喜欢搞那些烛光情调
The ladies, they cream up real nice for, like, candles and shit.

337
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:41,092
你肯定会艳福不浅啊
You are going to score, big time!

338
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:45,096
我们坐下来谈谈正事怎么样
All right, so how about we get, you know, down to it?

339
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:48,084
你们想吃的话  有点零食饮料
There's some refreshments over here if you want to partake.

340
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:52,078
还有别的什么吗
You got any other refreshments?

341
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,037
我已经戒了  有一阵子了
I could kick it. It's been a while.

342
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:59,057
我现在就想尝一口
I could totally go for a loving spoonful.

343
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:01,035
今天没有啤酒  也没有大麻
No bomb, no beer, no weed.

344
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,098
要抽自己回家抽  
You smoke it up on your own time.

345
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:05,050
在这里只谈正事
We're talking business here.

346
00:28:06,095 --> 00:28:09,035
听好了  现在这么干
So listen up. This is how it goes.

347
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:12,031
我给你们每人一盎司货
I front each of you an ounce.

348
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:16,038
你们卖2500我拿2000你们拿500
You sell it for 2,500. I keep the two, you keep the five.

349
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:19,017
别揩油  老老实实卖  懂吗
No cutting it. You sell it as is, all right?

350
00:28:19,017 --> 00:28:21,028
2500一盎司
2,500 an ounce?

351
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:23,087
价钱有点好像太高了
That's kinda, like, hopeful, bro.

352
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:27,030
街上都只卖1700  1800
Street's maybe 17, 18.

353
00:28:29,013 --> 00:28:31,074
这可是最上乘的货
This is the best shiz ever.

354
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:33,043
阿爹阿娘都会想要尝尝
Everybody and their mother's gonna want a taste.

355
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:36,076
还有  现在还有谁在卖货
And second, who else is selling right now, huh?

356
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:40,041
-外面确实断货了  -大家都去教堂了
- It's dry out there, that's for sure. - Church.

357
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,091
所以重点是你们想怎样
So you point it how you want, okay?

358
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:43,086
男女老少随便怎么来
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

359
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:47,037
但是我要保证我那份2000  没得商量
But I make what I make. Two large. No exceptions.

360
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:49,079
少了我的  你就给我走人
Short me, you're out.

361
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,064
揩油  也给我走人
Cut it, you're out.

362
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,092
而且要快
Period.

363
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:57,040
我给你们的可是大好的赚钱机会
This is a big opportunity I am giving you.

364
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,090
听懂了吗
Understand?

365
00:28:59,032 --> 00:29:01,061
猴子  怎么样
Badger, what is this?

366
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:05,070
大好机会
A big opportunity.

367
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,043
说的没错  这只是第一步
Exactly. All right? This is the ground floor.

368
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:13,041
兄弟们  能走多远要靠你们了
Gentlemen, how far you go is up to you.

369
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,032
那拿货出来吧  唷
So bring out the product, yo.

370
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,058
不在这儿  以后也不在这儿
Not here, all right? Not ever.

371
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,040
直接出货  我会告诉你们地点时间
Blind drop. I will let you know when and where.

372
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:24,015
好吗
All right?

373
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:27,022
我会通知你们
You'll be hearing from me.

374
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:29,077
现在我有大量的货要出手
Now, I got mad volume,

375
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:33,050
卖得越快  赚的也越多
So you move it quick, you move it right.

376
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,063
我的货源源不断
There is always more.

377
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:41,008
别做讨厌的人  生意开张了
DBAA, mo-fos.

378
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:43,051
你们加油干
All right? Apply yourselves.

379
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,098
那就是个龌龊的角落
It's an armpit.

380
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:26,035
不是龌龊的角落
It's not an armpit.

381
00:30:27,055 --> 00:30:29,044
对不起  你说得对 
Excuse me. You're right.

382
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:31,054
那里是西南方的巴黎之城
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

383
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:34,014
看在上帝的份上  那可是德克萨斯啊
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

384
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:37,035
就在没有王法的墨西哥边境上
Right on the border of lawless Mexican hell.

385
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:40,012
人头  他们会在那里扔人头
Human heads, they leave.

386
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:43,042
大毒枭们  会在那里抛尸  
The cartels, they litter the place with human heads.

387
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:46,061
这就是派我去那里的原因
Pretty sure that's why I'm going there.

388
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:51,059
好像还应该大肆宣传庆祝一样  
It's like a calling card or a shout-out or something.

389
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,088
要是华盛顿的话  我还能跟着一起去
Now, D.C., on the other hand, I could get behind.

390
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,072
你在那里埋头苦干
You just do your time like a good boy,

391
00:30:57,072 --> 00:31:00,055
没几年就能在乔治城可爱的公寓大厦
And I could see us in a cute little condo in Georgetown

392
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:01,099
住上了
in a couple of years.

393
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:18,073
我上网
I went online

394
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:21,096
看了超棒的
To this fantastic

395
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:24,096
华盛顿地产网站
real estate website for D.C.

396
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:29,003
我说不清  好像那里很有
There's just so much, I don't know,

397
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:31,023
文化气息
culture there.

398
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:33,091
我和汉克上司的妻子梅琳达谈过
I was talking to Melinda, Hank's boss's wife.

399
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:36,059
那个留着钢盔头  永远画着唇线的女人
The one with the helmet hair and the permanent lip liner.

400
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,022
总之  她对我说
Anyway, she was saying that...

401
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:45,095
道歉吧
Apologize.

402
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:49,055
什么
What?

403
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,087
我不想
I will not listen

404
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,093
再多听一个字
To one more word

405
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,000
除非你先道歉
Until you apologize.

406
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:01,006
为了什么
For?

407
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,059
你心里清楚着呢  玛丽
You know perfectly well, Marie.

408
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,087
-很明显  我完全  -你撒谎了
- Well, obviously I don't... - Your lies.

409
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,006
对我说谎了
to me.

410
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,058
在商店里顺手牵羊
The shoplifting?

411
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:12,038
所有的一切
All of it?

412
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:15,062
难道你真的以为
Did you really think it was all just

413
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:17,046
这一切都能就这样算了吗
neatly gonna go away?

414
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:21,035
如果不是你硬要还回去的话
If you hadn't tried to return it...

415
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:23,013
道歉
Apologize.

416
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:28,072
这是你最后的机会  我是认真的
Now or never. I mean it.

417
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,066
否则我们就一刀两断
Or it'll never be the same.

418
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:36,059
为什么这样惩罚我
Why are you punishing me?

419
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:40,033
如果你完全不尊重我
If you don't respect me

420
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:43,088
不想道歉的话  那就告诉我实话
Enough to apologize, to tell me the truth, then...

421
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,036
我想找回以前的妹妹
I need my sister back.

422
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:10,074
对不起
I'm sorry.

423
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,035
对不起
I'm sorry.

424
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,062
你想要听血淋淋的细节吗
You want the gory details?

425
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:31,089
不  你不会想听的
No, you don't.

426
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,058
会让你睡不着的
Keep you up at night.

427
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:36,011
那么
So...

428
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:39,068
当时吓人吗
Was it scary?

429
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,082
非常恐怖  年轻人
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary, you little punk.

430
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:44,039
老天啊
Jesus.

431
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:46,095
但你开枪比他快
But you were way faster than him.

432
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:49,045
我还在这里  不是吗
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

433
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:54,053
你揍扁他  还出名了
Hell, yeah. Kick ass and take names.

434
00:33:54,053 --> 00:33:56,091
-儿子  -不用  没事
- Son. - Nah, it's fine.

435
00:33:58,047 --> 00:33:59,088
你知道是什么感觉吗
You know what it is?

436
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:03,050
一个蟑螂从冰箱底下爬出来  你怎么办
A cockroach comes out from under a fridge, what do you do?

437
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,004
你根本不用想
I mean, you don't think about it.

438
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:08,074
你会打死它们
You stop them down.

439
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:12,040
他们怎么会变成那样
Where do they come from?

440
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,084
我是说罪犯  像你打死的那个
Criminals, like the one you...

441
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:20,054
你觉得是什么原因让他们变成了罪犯
What do you think it is that makes them who they are.

442
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,091
伙计  你最好问我关于蟑螂的问题
Buddy, you might as well be asking me about the roaches.

443
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:30,017
我所知道的就是有一大群的罪犯
All I know is there's a whole armada.

444
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,067
伙计  我去撒个尿
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

445
00:36:49,026 --> 00:36:50,033
警察
Cops!

446
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,059
我不肯定是你
I wasn't sure it was you.

447
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,035
新车吗
New car?

448
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,072
东西放在厢式车上了
Keeping things on the D.L.

449
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,067
我猜你的办法不奏效吧
I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.

450
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:10,065
你那份
Your half.

451
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:14,039
15000  我承诺过的
15K. That's what I'm talking about.

452
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:18,075
不用客气
You're welcome.

453
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,044
上帝啊
Jesus.

454
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,094
帮我做做算术  好吗
Help me understand the math, okay?

455
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:27,026
我给了你一磅  对吗
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

456
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:30,069
每盎司  你和我平分2000
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

457
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:34,057
每人1000  1磅也就是16盎司
$1,000 each. 1 pound, that's 16 ounces.

458
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:39,063
16盎司应该是16000才对
16 ounces should net to me $16,000.

459
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:40,062
是16
16,

460
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,072
不是15
Not 15.

461
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:45,071
出了点状况
Something came up.

462
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,043
出了状况
Something came up?

463
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:51,031
我的一个人被一帮吸毒的困住了
One of my guys got held up by a couple junkies.

464
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:56,001
损失了一盎司  但还好瘦子皮特没事
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay? Skinny Pete's cool.

465
00:38:58,037 --> 00:39:00,029
所以你的意思是
So you're saying that

466
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:03,082
你的人被抢劫了  或者说  你被抢劫了
Your guy got robbed. Or, rather, you got robbed,

467
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:06,034
但是没关系
But it doesn't matter.

468
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:10,033
傻瓜  那个叫损耗  
Dude, it's called "breakage," okay?

469
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:12,071
就像大超市  货品总会有损耗
Like K-Mart. Shit breaks.

470
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:14,092
而且你觉得这些都可以接受
And you're thinking this is acceptable?

471
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:18,004
这就是做生意的代价  唷
It's the cost of business, yo.

472
00:39:18,004 --> 00:39:20,005
你要为了1000块跟我烦吗
You're sweating me over a grand?

473
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:21,037
我只是个化学家
Look, I'm just the chemist, here.

474
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:23,052
我可不是街上的小混混  唷
I'm not the street guy, yo.

475
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:26,077
对我来说你所谓的损耗
But it seems to me that what you call "breakage"

476
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:30,013
只是让自己看起来像傻子
Is just you making a fool of yourself.

477
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:33,032
我还要送你另一个专业术语
I've got another technical term for you.

478
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:36,019
不可持续的商业模式
"Non-sustainable business model."

479
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:38,027
你只看到了负面
You're focusing on the negative.

480
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:42,087
我们每天赚6000块  你还有什么问题
Six grand a day we're making. What's your problem?

481
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:45,043
消息泄露了怎么办
What happens when word gets out,

482
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:48,043
你雇的小丑可不会小心谨慎
And it's open season on these clowns you've hired?

483
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:52,021
一旦每个人都知道了杰西·平克曼
Once everyone knows that Jesse Pinkman,

484
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:56,005
大毒枭  被打劫了也不出声
Drug lord, can be robbed with impunity...

485
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:57,089
伙计  算了吧
Man, come on.

486
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:00,098
你以为屠库那样的人会有损耗吗
You think Tuco had breakage?

487
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:06,058
他确实会有  他会打断别人的骨头
I guess it's true, he did. He broke bones.

488
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:09,085
他会把在他地盘撒野的人头都拧碎
He broke the skull of anybody who tried to rip him off.

489
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:12,029
你还想要1000吗  是不是
You want another grand? Is that it?

490
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:15,054
-不是我想要说的  -拿着  给
- Not my point. - Take it. Here.

491
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:21,094
你现在有15000  昨天你还什么都没有
Look, you got 15,000 you didn't have yesterday.

492
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:24,044
我们在赚钱  总会有些情况
We're making bank. Shit happens.

493
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:27,023
我的人知道要怎么做  他们非常小心
My guys get what they're up against, and they're careful.

494
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:28,063
我也一样
So am I.

495
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:31,054
你就坐在家里好吃好喝共享天伦吧
And you're all tucked in at night with your precious family.

496
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,054
别再像怪人一样想这想那了
So why don't you just stop being such a freak about everything?

497
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:37,027
你的分工非常明确
You've made the division of labor very clear.

498
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:42,018
唷  说真的
Yo, I mean, seriously.

499
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:44,067
你到底想我怎么样
What the hell do you want me to do?

500
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:15,021
对不起
Sorry.

501
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,040
你溜进来了
You snuck in.

502
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:19,031
我都不知道你回家了
Didn't even know you were home.

503
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,065
你在吃什么
What you eating?

504
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:26,001
三明治  想吃的话冰箱里还有一个
A panini. There's another one in the freezer if you want it.

505
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:29,011
我以为我们从不吃那些东西
I thought we nixed those, huh?

506
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:35,080
我是说  那些不是低钠的吧
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones with the off-the-chart sodium?

507
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,039
我突然很想吃
I had a craving.

508
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:40,096
难得吃一次没什么大不了的
Once in a while is no big deal.

509
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,085
小沃尔特去哪里了
So where's Junior?

510
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:50,070
出去了
Out.

511
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:53,070
和谁
With whom?

512
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:02,010
去哪里了
Out where?

513
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,088
某个地方吧  我不知道
Somewhere. I don't know.

514
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:08,070
晚上9点之前会回来
He'll be back by 9:00.

515
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:14,069
我还以为你会对儿子的去向有所了解
I just thought you might have a clue where your son is.

516
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,075
那你为什么不知道
Why don't you?

517
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,032
为什么总是我一个人来关心他去哪里
Why am I the only one who needs to keep track of our son?

518
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,062
告诉你  沃尔特  你想知道就自己去问
I'll tell you what, Walt. You want to know where he is, ask him.

519
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:27,088
像我一样打电话给他
Just pick up the phone like I do.

520
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:47,033
可能你会知道
Perhaps you might know something...

521
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,028
这个
About this.

522
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:54,036
可能
Perhaps.

523
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:57,055
但也可能
And then again,

524
00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:00,026
我不知道  沃尔特
Perhaps I don't, Walt

525
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,002
可能我梦游时抽过
Perhaps I smoked them in a fugue state.

526
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,002
我想要你解释一下
I'd like an explanation.

527
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:12,003
-你不会想再说下去  -你为什么要抽烟
- You really don't want to go down... - Why would you do this?

528
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:13,076
看在上帝的份上  你还怀着孕
You're pregnant, for God's sakes.

529
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:15,001
三根半香烟
Three and a half cigarettes

530
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:17,047
不会对孩子怎么样的
is not going to do a thing to the baby.

531
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:19,088
-不会怎么样的  -很高兴你这么肯定  医生
- Nothing. - I'm glad you're so sure, Doctor.

532
00:43:19,088 --> 00:43:22,077
三根半  就这么多  剩下的都扔了
Three and a half. That was it. I tossed the rest.

533
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:24,060
你肯定很想听到这个
And I'm sure you'll be very glad to hear that, yes,

534
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,009
没错  我感到羞耻
Yes, I feel ashamed.

535
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:33,066
斯凯勒  做这样的事
Skyler, This is something that...

536
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:37,078
-一点都不像你  -真的吗
- This is so unlike you. - Oh, really?

537
00:43:38,027 --> 00:43:39,092
你怎么会知道
How would you know?

538
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,080
不用  谢谢
No, thank you.

539
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,047
你问我想要你怎么做
You had asked me what I want you to do.

540
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,095
我想你把这个处理掉
I want you to handle it.
