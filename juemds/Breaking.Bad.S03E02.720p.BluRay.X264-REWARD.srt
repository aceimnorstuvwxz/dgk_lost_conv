早上好  警官
Good morning, Officer.

17
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:04,040
-先生  能把音乐关小吗   -噢  好的
- Sir, can you turn the music down? - Oh, yeah.

18
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:06,034
好的
All right.

19
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:08,034
关小的意思是关掉
Down means off.

20
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:11,048
当然  好的
Of course. Okay.

21
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:13,074
知道为什么要你靠边停吗
You know why I pulled you over this morning?

22
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:16,028
我很  很确定我没有超速
Well, I'm-- I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.

23
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:18,062
我装了定速巡航  所以我...
I've been using the cruise control, so I--

24
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:20,015
不  先生  是你的挡风玻璃
No, sir. Your windshield.

25
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:24,012
请出示驾照和行驶证
License and registration, please.

26
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,092
好的
Right.

27
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,096
这...这是515航班造成的
This-- This was from Wayfarer 515.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,041
-我家正好就残骸区中  -好的
- Um, my house was in the debris field. - Okay.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,077
恩  而且
Uh, and that's--

30
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,077
飞机上掉下的碎片
that's what shattered my windshield--

31
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,048
打碎了我的挡风玻璃
some piece of wreckage from the plane.

32
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:49,051
我明白
I understand.

33
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,078
你知道515航班  那次坠机事件
You know of-- of Flight 515, the plane crash?

34
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:57,072
-你戴着绶带  -是的  先生
- You're wearing the ribbon.  - Yes, sir.

35
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,069
我非常清楚515航班
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

36
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:01,099
我是那天在现场第一批反应过来的一员
I was one of the first responders on the scene that day.

37
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,089
那你现在在做什么
Then what are you doing?

38
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:06,069
传讯你  先生
Citing you, sir.

39
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:09,023
什么  什么  你不相信我
What? What, you don't believe me?

40
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:11,040
先生  不管挡风玻璃是怎么损坏的
Sir, regardless of how that windshield was damaged,

41
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:13,070
在此情况下驾驶这辆车都是不安全的
this car is unsafe to drive in this condition.

42
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:15,073
请呆在车里
Stay in the car, please.

43
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:21,064
等等  等一会  就一会
Wait. Wait just a minute. Just one minute.

44
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,086
先生  我要求你呆在车里
Sir, I asked you to stay in the vehicle.

45
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:23,043
不  不  不
No, no, no.

46
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:26,014
-我有权利从自己的车里出来  -先生  听着
- I can get out of my own car. - Sir, listen--

47
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:27,038
不  不  不  你听我说
No, no, no. You listen to me.

48
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,028
现在是你听我说
It's time for you to listen to me.

49
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:30,066
先生  你需要做一下深呼吸
Sir, what you need to do is take a deep breath,

50
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:32,038
-冷静一下  -这是美国
- Calm down. - This is America.

51
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:33,062
现在回到车里
And get back in that car now.

52
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:35,019
-我有权利  -你能明白么
- I have rights. - Do you understand that?

53
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,069
至少有起码的礼貌把我的话听完
At least have the common decency to hear me out.

54
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:39,032
你现在立刻退后
I need you to step back right now.

55
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:41,016
-你有没有听到我说什么  -先生  冷静
- Did you even hear what I said? - Sir, calm down.

56
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,036
你现在竟然给我开罚单  我告诉过你
Now you're giving me a ticket? I told you

57
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,029
我家就在残骸区
that my house was in the debris field.

58
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:48,039
你有没有稍微注意到这意味着什么
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?

59
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,012
先生  冷静
Sir, calm down.

60
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,020
地狱之火雨点般撒落在我的房子上
Hellfire rained down on my house

61
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,076
-请你立刻后退  -落在我孩子睡觉的地方
- Sir, I need you to step back now. - Where my children sleep!

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,060
在我院子里散落着尸体的碎片
There were body parts in my yard!

63
00:03:55,063 --> 00:03:58,000
-先生  最后一次警告你  -你在耍我
- Sir, this is your last warning. - You gotta be kidding me!

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,034
你有两秒钟时间退后
You got about two seconds to stand down,

65
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:01,017
否则我将对你使用胡椒喷雾器
or I'm gonna pepper spray you.

66
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:02,010
你有胡椒喷雾  棒极了
You're gonna pepper spray? Perfect!

67
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:05,004
真的是太棒了  对一个在美国宪法保护下
That is just perfect! Pepper spray the man

68
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,088
表达自己观点的人使用胡椒喷雾器
who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!

最近  埃尔帕索暗中有些小动作
Lastly, a little something from down El Paso way.

84
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,084
边境巡逻队遇到的多重凶杀案
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides

85
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:42,044
只是在边境这边
just this side of the border.

86
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:44,037
出了华雷斯和拉雷
Truck turn out to be a chicken run

87
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,058
卡车就成了小鸡快跑
out of Juarez and Laredo.

88
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,058
边境巡逻队和这些走私贩子
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek

89
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,065
玩了两年捉迷藏
with these polleros for two years.

90
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:53,015
但是这一次  他们刚一过来
But this time, as soon as they made it across,

91
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,088
有人就攻击了他们  狠狠地攻击了他们
someone hit them-- hit them hard.

92
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:58,042
我们这里说的是一个司机和九个非法移民
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.

93
00:04:58,045 --> 00:04:59,092
没有枪手的迹象
No sign of the shooters.

94
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:01,082
这辆客车装的可不仅仅是人
This truck was carrying more than just people.

95
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:04,032
我们在找什么  烟草  可卡因还是冰毒
What are we looking at? Weed, coke, or meth?

96
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:07,036
都不是  他们看起来不像是在运输毒品
Nah. Doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.

97
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,043
那边境巡逻队干嘛踢给我们
So, why did the Border Patrol kick this to us?

98
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:11,050
他们没踢给我们  是我要过来的
They didn't. I pulled it.

99
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:13,066
你问我  这是卡特尔集团高层的杰作
You ask me, this's high-end cartel work.

100
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,050
也许是洛泽塔斯团伙
Los Zetas, maybe.

101
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:19,000
问题是  为什么我们的非军事区
Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action

102
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,097
 华雷斯暴行: 墨西哥北部边境奇瓦瓦州的华雷斯Juarez因贩毒和暴力而“闻名”  被人称为“鬼城”  今年以来  已有包括16个警察在内的280人被犯罪集团杀害

103
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,097
会出现华雷斯暴行
on our side of the DMZ?

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,031
他们发送消息或清除道路
They sending a message or clearing a path?

105
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:27,041
或者这是要阻止一场特殊的边界斗争
Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?

106
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,038
也许其中一个入境的墨西哥人
Maybe one of those extra-crispies

107
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,065
知道了他不该知道的
knew something he shouldn't.

108
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:33,068
不管怎么样  眼睛放亮点
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

109
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:36,022
好吧  就这样  没什么要说的了
All right. That's it. Slow news day.

110
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:38,039
补充一点
Add one more to the countdown.

111
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,032
哦  什么  格米
Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomie?

112
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:42,036
我们还等着你那著名的蓝色冰毒的进展呢
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.

113
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,012
自从上次见过它已经过去29天了
29 days since we saw it last.

114
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:48,033
哦  是啊  仍在逍遥法外  格米  别担心
Yeah, well, it's still out there, Gomie. Don't worry.

115
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:50,056
当地警察  我得接这个电话
Local PD. I gotta take this.

116
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,070
格米  打你的皮纳塔去吧
Gomie, go beat your Piñata.

117
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,070
Piñata: 挂起来让小孩子挥棒子打的一种东西  打破了就有糖果掉出来

118
00:05:52,073 --> 00:05:55,073
其他聊天打屁的  安静点
Rest of you jokers- too damn quiet in here.

119
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:58,000
去抓坏蛋
Go catch some bad guys.

120
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,007
施拉德
Schrader.

121
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:02,011
嘿  保罗  怎么了
Hey, what's up, Paul?

122
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:05,027
什么
What?

123
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:56,012
杰西
Jesse?

124
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,019
嗨  爸爸
Hey, Dad.

125
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:01,095
你在整修这栋房子
So you're fixing up the house, huh?

126
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,012
就小修一下
Doing a little work, yeah.

127
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:07,053
恩  那我就先走了
Uh, I'll bounce.

128
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,060
做的不错
It's-- It's cool.

129
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,053
你最近好吗
You doing okay?

130
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:16,050
嗯  我很好
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

131
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:19,007
我只是开车经过
I just happened to be driving by

132
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,084
看见牌子
and saw the sign.

133
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:23,068
那你要卖这个地方吗
So, you're selling the place.

134
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,091
在这种经济形势下
In this market.

135
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:27,078
你能相信吗
Can you believe it?

136
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:31,091
你把车房给挪了挪  这想法挺大胆
I see you moved the garage. That's bold.

137
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:34,075
是你母亲的主意  这可是大工程
Your mother's idea. It's quite an operation.

138
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,018
我们粉刷了所有的墙面  所有的主卧室
We did, all new stucco, all the master suite,

139
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:39,092
喷沙打磨  熏蒸消毒了地下室
sandblasted, fumigated the basement...

140
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,092
好极了
Right on.

141
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:46,059
是啊
Yeah.

142
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:50,013
整修一下肯定能提高转售价值
Fixing up the place totally increases resale value.

143
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:52,076
那是我读到的  我想说的是  就像
I read that in- I want to say, like,

144
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,046
时代周刊里说的
Time magazine.

145
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,040
那楼上浴室你是怎么处理的
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?

146
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:02,017
全部重做  浴室和厨房全铺新瓷砖
All redone. New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens,

147
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,017
花岗岩台面  全新设备
granite countertops, new appliances--

148
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:06,091
全部是最好的
all top of the line.

149
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:09,034
天呐  太棒了  爸爸
Damn. That's great, Dad.

150
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,034
我能随便参观一下吗
Think, uh, I can get a tour?

151
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,081
恩  这些师傅正加紧完工呢
Eh, these guys are trying to finish up.

152
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,078
我们最好还是别妨碍他们
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.

153
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,033
如果你想看看的话
There are pictures on the Web site,

154
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,095
网站上有图片
if you wanna take a look.

155
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,086
好吧
Cool.

156
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,083
你看上去气色不错
You're looking healthy.

157
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:33,056
我会告诉你母亲的  她会很欣慰的
I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy.

158
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,003
多谢
Thanks.

159
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:41,040
我想说  我可以时不时的来看望你们
You know, I could come by sometime

160
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:44,004
吃个晚饭或做点什么别的
for, uh, dinner or something.

161
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,024
好啊
Yeah.

162
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,031
改日吧
Sometime.

163
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:53,041
好的
Okay.

164
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:55,038
回见  爸爸
Later, Dad.

165
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:10,006
你知道的  听着
You know, look,

166
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,063
他是怀恩中学的高中老师
he's a high school teacher over at Wynne.

167
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:15,050
一辈子从未出过任何乱子
Never been in trouble a day of his life.

168
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,050
后来他发现自己有肺癌
Found out he's got lung cancer,

169
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:20,052
然后他老婆把他这倒霉蛋从家里踢了出去
and now his wife kicks the poor out of his own house.

170
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:23,014
我的意思是  兄弟们
I mean, look, guys,

171
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:25,087
如果说谁心里有点火
if anybody rates a little slack,

172
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:28,037
也就是他了
here's the guy.

173
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,098
嘿  沃尔特  嗯
Hey, Walt, uh,

174
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:41,025
你还记得卡瓦诺警官吗
You remember Officer Cavanaugh?

175
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:51,023
警官  我很抱歉对您发火
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper.

176
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:54,056
我的这种行为无法原谅
There's no excuse for my behavior.

177
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,090
太无礼了
It was disrespectful.

178
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,036
她要跟我离婚
She's divorcing me.

179
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:31,099
我不知道该怎么跟你说  老兄
Oh, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.

180
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:34,033
事已至此了
It is what it is.

181
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,057
她还不准让我见孩子
She doesn't want me to see the kids.

182
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:45,097
她是这么说的
She said that?

183
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,041
是的
Yeah.

184
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,079
你没写信也没给我打电话
You don't write? You don't call?

185
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,096
天呐
God.

186
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,027
这是场灾难
It's a disaster.

187
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,040
这不是灾难
It is not a disaster.

188
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:28,064
-哦  好的  -这不是灾难  行了吧
- Oh, okay. - It's not a disaster, all right?

189
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:30,016
她不会去告诉警察
She's not going to the cops.

190
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:32,028
她也不会告诉任何人
She's not gonna tell a living soul.

191
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:34,028
你想知道为什么吗
You wanna know why?

192
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,033
一个词  利益双关
one word "Blowback."

193
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,022
如果她泄露秘密
If she blabs,

194
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:43,055
对她来说也是灾难
it'll be a disaster for her.

195
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,069
那个缉毒所的妹夫
That DEA brother-in-law?

196
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,029
也跟着倒霉
Whew! Screwed.

197
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,096
你就在他的眼皮子底下犯事
You were right under his nose.

198
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:51,038
他要是幸运的话今后也就只能
He'll be lucky if they let him

199
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:53,040
在消闲商店里抓抓吸毒的
bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.

200
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,083
孩子们呢  打电话给菲尔医生说
The kids-- Paging Dr. Phil.

201
00:11:55,087 --> 00:12:00,023
我爸爸是毒贩子  我妈妈把他告发了
My daddy's a drug dealer, and my mommy turned him in.

202
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:02,020
现在房子也没有了
And the house-- gone.

203
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,062
逮捕她  然后把孩子们都赶出去
RICO her and the kids out on the street.

204
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:06,091
还要和他们继续争执的话  只能祝你好运了
Good luck arguing with them on that.

205
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:09,024
不会的  这些都不会发生
No. It's not gonna happen.

206
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,091
她在虚张声势
She's bluffing,

207
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:14,005
而且她也明白
and she knows it.

208
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:22,009
她是否去跟警察告密
Her going to the police

209
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,089
这不是重点  索尔
is not the point, Saul.

210
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:27,059
她要走出我的生活  你明白吗
She's out of my life. Do you understand?

211
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:30,013
我失去了我的家庭
I've lost my family,

212
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,056
我在乎的一切都没了
everything that I care about.

213
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,073
嘿  兄弟
Hey, buddy,

214
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:39,007
恩  太糟了
uh, it's bad.

215
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,057
好吧  这是灾难
All right... It's a calamity,

216
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,004
但我们留得青山在  不怕没柴烧
but we live to fight another day.

217
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:48,017
等过一段时间  风平浪静了
And after a decent interval of time,

218
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:49,098
然后
Well,

219
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,054
天涯何处无芳草啊
There are other fish in the sea.

220
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:56,051
你已经有很长时间没在这个圈子里了
You've been out of circulation for a while.

221
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:59,098
我的意思是  外面的世界很精彩
I mean, you'll be just amazed at what's out there.

222
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:02,032
泰国妞  捷克妞
Thailand, the Czech Republic...

223
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:05,056
我是说  那些女人都会万分荣幸
I mean, those women are so grateful

224
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,086
的到这儿来
to even be here.

225
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,039
与此同时呢
In the meantime,

226
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:13,056
闲则生非
idle hands are the devil's playthings,

227
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,016
所以  你应该重新开始
So, uh, you should get back on the horse

228
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,060
做你最拿手的事
and do what you do best.

229
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:22,074
第一步  和我们的朋友谈谈并开始制毒
First step, talk to our friend and get cooking.

230
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:33,028
我不能做坏人
I can't be the bad guy.

231
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:35,098
什么
What?

232
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:40,035
我不能做坏人
I can't be the bad guy.

233
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:46,086
好吧
Okay.

234
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:52,080
那么  这样吧  我们再联系
You know, we'll, uh-- we'll revisit.

235
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,057
只是  恩
Just, uh,

236
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,020
答应我你不会把自己吊死在壁橱里
Promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.

237
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:33,076

241
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:59,092
他老婆可能是个麻烦
We may have a wife problem.

242
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:03,055
给我密切关注这事
Look, I need eyes on it.

243
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,029
你有地址吗
You got an address?

244
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,081
晚饭大概要晚点才能吃了
Hey, dinner's gonna be late.

245
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:30,060
汉克姨夫和玛丽姨妈带外卖了
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout.

246
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,074
如果你饿的话

247
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:37,015
我可以先给你弄点简单的吃

248
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,043
好吧
Okay.

249
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,048
把番茄酱拿给我好吗
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?

250
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,049
怎么了
What?

251
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:22,049
我吃够反式脂肪酸了
I've had enough trans fat for one lifetime.

252
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,010
何不开两天车到附近海滩去
A two-day drive from the nearest ocean,

253
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,019
你就能吃到生鱼了
and you're eating raw fish.

254
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:26,073
这就是我的意见
That's all I'm saying.

255
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,084
那米诺鱼会更新鲜
Been a while since that minnow been swimming.

256
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:31,020
对吧  老兄
Right, buddy?

257
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:38,057
你们知道  弗林

259
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:43,037
如果你们有什么消息
I don't know. If you know of anything, you might wanna--

260
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,058
我叫小沃尔特
My-- My name's Walter Jr.

261
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,004
你好像
Like-- Like--

262
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:49,075
你难道连他的名字都不愿提吗
What, you-- you can't even say his name?

263
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,008
如果你改变主意不想叫弗林了
Um, if you've changed your mind about being called Flynn,

264
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,029
只需告诉我
All you need to do is just tell me

265
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,052
-你不想叫这个名字  -你知道吗
- That you don't want to be called Flynn. - You know what?

266
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,069
爸直到第四节课才来
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period,

267
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:00,082
他的眼睛都红了
and his eyes were all red

268
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:03,005
像是哭过了一样
like he'd been crying or something.

269
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,001
但你一点都不关心
But you-- you don't even care.

270
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,058
现在他都不愿送我回家了
And now, he won't even drive me home.

271
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,051
他不说为什么
He won't say why,

272
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:14,022
但我知道肯定是你从中作梗
But I know it's because you told him not to.

273
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,055
-亲爱的  我  -你什么
- Honey, I  - What?

274
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,022
我不知道你有什么毛病
I don't know what your problem is.

275
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:21,029
大概你不再爱他了
You may not love him anymore,

276
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:24,055
但是我爱
But I do.

277
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,092
为什么你非得
I mean, why you gotta be--

278
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,079
非得像个贱人
Why-- Why you gotta be such a-- a bitch?

279
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,062
别这样说
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Oh...

280
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:34,065
-汉克  -你不能这么和妈妈说话
- Hank-- Hank-- Hank  - You don't talk to your mom that way.

281
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:37,052
没事
It's-- It's-- It's all right.

282
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:44,019
斯凯勒  我知道你这样做
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons

283
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:46,036
一定有自己的理由
for...all of this.

284
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,010
我
I...

285
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:52,040
斯凯
Sky, uh,

286
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:55,000
我知道这不关我的事
I-- I know it's none of my business,

287
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:56,067
但是
But, uh,

288
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:01,094
不让沃尔特见孩子...
Keeping Walt from the kids...

289
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,005
你是对的  汉克
You're right, Hank.

290
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,096
这不关你的事
It's none of your business.

291
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,093
我的天
Oh, my God.

292
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,090
到了现在  你还能说
After all of that, please tell me

293
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:25,000
你对他们的事不好奇吗
That you are still not curious.

294
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,067
没什么可好奇的
There's nothing to be curious about.

295
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,034
拜托
Please.

296
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:30,087
今天我听说了怀特还有一部手机
The day I heard there was a second cell phone, I knew.

297
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,088
这种事我看过几百次了
Believe me. I've seen it a hundred times.

298
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:35,085
好吧  那是什么
Okay. All right. So, what?

299
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:38,062
别卖关子了  到底是什么事
Stop dancing around it. What is it exactly

300
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:40,015
什么事你看了几百次
that you have seen a hundred times?

301
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,065
告诉我吧
Please, please, enlighten me.

302
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:44,059
像沃尔特那样的人
Look, a guy like Walt--

303
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:46,076
你知道的  好好先生  正直  聪明
A nice guy, decent, smart, you know?

304
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,016
实话实说  他却不成功  生命到头了
Let's face it-- underachiever, dead-end life, okay?

305
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:53,046
他罹患癌症  时日无多  加上中年危机
He gets cancer. Time's running out. Midlife crisis.

306
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,063
他承受不了  爆发了  出轨了
He acts up. Steps out.

307
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,040
然后被老婆逮住
Then the wife-- she catches him.

308
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,067
这都是老掉牙的故事了
I mean, it's a story as old as time.

309
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,077
用用脑子吧  玛丽
Look, do the math, Marie.

310
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,041
只有这种可能
Only comes out one way.

311
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,061
看看沃尔特
Knowing Walt, he, uh,

312
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,091
那么内疚  估计是自己向她坦白的
felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.

313
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,075
是吗  我
Yeah, I--

314
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:14,095
我不知道
I don't know. I think...

315
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:17,082
如果他出轨了  她应该会告诉我
If he cheated on her, that she would've told me by now.

316
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:21,022
我就是觉得
It just feels like...

317
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,019
事情比出轨更严重
something more.

318
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,056
是  是  日以继夜  还用问吗
Yes, yes, yes. 24-7 coverage. Need you ask?

319
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:36,025
还要我怎么做
How much is this gonna run me?

320
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,042
老天  我入错行了
Jesus. I'm in the wrong business.

321
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,002
我再打给你
Yeah. I'll call you.

322
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:44,082
浪子回头啦
Return of the prodigal.

323
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:46,022
欢迎回归现实
Welcome back to the land of the living.

324
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:47,059
-感觉如何  -很好
- How you feeling? - I'm good.

325
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,032
当然如此  世界任你享用
Of course you are. The world's your oyster.

326
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:53,005
我说得对吗  拥有成堆的现金
Am I right? Unencumbered young man

327
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,045
可以随心所欲的年轻人
with, uh, stacks of cash.

328
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:58,095
我可嫉妒你了
Hey, I'm, uh-- I'm jealous.

329
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:01,072
我发誓  绝对是嫉妒了
Hand to God, I'm jealous.

330
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,012
说到现金
Yeah, speaking of cash,

331
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,059
你知道最近谁最让我心痛吗
Uh, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?

332
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:09,039
你的老搭档  这家伙
Your former partner. This guy...

333
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,016
没命地干  是吧
He works like a bastard, right?

334
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:13,023
白手起家
Builds a business, single-handed.

335
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:15,096
结果大生意来了  他呢
Finally, the big money shows up, and what does he do?

336
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,090
他不干了
He walks out.

337
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,000
他有那么高的天赋
Talent like that,

338
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:23,033
却弃之不用
and he just flushes it down the crapper.

339
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:25,087
就好像米开朗琪罗不去画画
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

340
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,037
我知道你洗手不干了
Look, I know you're out of it and all,

341
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,087
但你
But you--

342
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,094
你会和他谈谈的吧
You wouldn't talk to him, would you?

343
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,066
帮助他清醒过来
I mean, help him pull his head out of his ass?

344
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:36,094
好吧  好吧  不管他了
Alright. Alright, stretch that.

345
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:40,063
他不会听我的  也不会听你的
He won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you,

346
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,005
无意冒犯
All due respect.

347
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:47,038
你想要工作吗
You want a job?

348
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:49,092
工作
A job?

349
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:51,092
谁要找我
Who's got a job for me?

350
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:54,009
我
I do.

351
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,000
我是想
Thought I'd, uh,

352
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:28,064
来看看  你不介意的话
Well, visit, if you don't mind.

353
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,071
当然不介意  你不
No, of course not. You don't, uh...

354
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:32,071
-你不需要用这间房间吧  -不用
- You don't need the room, do you?  - No.

355
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:35,068
我的东西摊得比较开
I just needed some more space to spread out.

356
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:37,071
我来看看小霍莉
Just wanted to say hello to little Holly here.

357
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,065
嘿  小姑娘  你好啊
Hey, girl. Hi.

358
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:42,022
没事啦  高兴点儿
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

359
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:44,005
这就对了
Oh, yeah.

360
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,045
真是个小美人  你看她
She is a beauty. Look at her.

361
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,056
谢谢你通融让我带她来
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.

362
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,073
我只是希望你能全心投入工作
Well, I just wish we had you back full time.

363
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,083
你们也给这里带来许多朝气
You do brighten up the place.

364
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,017
听我说  相信我
Listen, believe me, this is, uh...

365
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,010
我不想这样
I don't wanna bring this up,

366
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:07,004
但是  这些季度报表我不能签
but I... I can't sign off on these quarterlies.

367
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:10,011
对不起  真的不能签
I'm sorry. I just can't.

368
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:14,071
有问题吗
Is that right?

369
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:19,051
就算你真的要这样做  泰德
If you're gonna do this, Ted,

370
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:22,015
也不能如此明目张胆
you can't be so glaring about it.

371
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:26,035
明目张胆
Glaring.

372
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,036
好吧
Okay.

373
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,029
听起来蛮严重
That does sound bad.

374
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:34,012
跟我说说是什么问题
Uh, show me what's bothering you.

375
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,093
凯勒
Keller.

376
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:44,097
不
No.

377
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,013
又是
Again...

378
00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:47,034
我很抱歉
God, I'm sorry.

379
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:49,034
我知道你的感受
I know how you feel about this.

380
00:25:49,037 --> 00:25:51,057
不明来源收入
Revenue with no backup.

381
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:55,008
这里  这里  还有这里
Here, here, and here.

382
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,011
我都不知道该怎么说
I don't even know what to say.

383
00:26:09,052 --> 00:26:11,086
好吧  这个可以修正的  是吧
Okay. This is- This is fixable, right?

384
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:16,012
你看我把两万八千八百元销掉
How about if I just push, uh, 28,800,

385
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:18,093
延到下季度如何
um, out of this into next quarter?

386
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:22,013
那样的话你可以签吗
Would you sign it then?

387
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,030
我  呃
I'm--

388
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,053
我得说
I'm just saying

389
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:32,094
我不能签  因为这笔收入现在已经存在了
I can't sign it as it currently exists.

390
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:35,017
那好吧
Fair enough.

391
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:37,011
我自己处理
I'll take care of it.

392
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,004
多谢你预先通知我
Thank you for the heads-up.

393
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:42,088
这种事以后不会再发生了  我保证
Well, you won't have to deal with this again, I swear.

394
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:46,048
如果你的孩子们知道了怎么办
What if your kids found out?

395
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:52,029
我的孩子们知道什么
If my kids found out?

396
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,029
你做的这些事
This... what you're doing.

397
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:57,022
总有一天  他们会长大
I mean, someday, they're gonna be old enough.

398
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:59,049
你怎么对他们解释
How would you explain it to them?

399
00:27:04,016 --> 00:27:06,063
你这是为难我呀  为什么呢
Put me on the spot, why don't you?

400
00:27:08,037 --> 00:27:11,037
我想  我或许
I guess maybe I'd, um...

401
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,017
我想  我或许是有污点
I'd say that, uh, I might have feet of clay that...

402
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:17,041
但是我所做的一切  都是为了他们
But that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.

403
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:19,097
知道吗  是为了更好地培养他们
You know? Trying to provide.

404
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:23,041
我会让他们
And, uh, I'd ask them

405
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:26,091
尽量花些时间去了解
to try to take the time to understand...

406
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:30,088
你知道吗  事实上
You know what? Truth is,

407
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:32,089
我还没有想过那么远  斯凯勒
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.

408
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:36,049
我一直是在奋力挣扎  所以
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...

409
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,069
我该回去了
I better get back to it.

410
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,004
上帝啊
Oh, God.

411
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:53,084
嗨  沃尔特  听我说
Hi, Walt. Listen.

412
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:56,098
我现在不方便讲话  我在工作
I'm... I can't talk- I'm at work right now.

413
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,048
什么
What?

414
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,088
路易斯开车送他来的  我到家的时候他已经在了
Louis dropped him off. He was here when I got home.

415
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:04,005
不  不  当然不  他得回去
No, no, no. Of course. No. He's not staying.

416
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:05,095
他明白的
He understands that.

417
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:07,095
你要我送他到哪里都可以
I'll... I'll bring him anywhere you want.

418
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:10,002
爸
Dad...

419
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:13,008
那个  现在是交通高峰
Well, yeah, it is rush hour.

420
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:14,039
我是说  我当然可以逆着车流
I mean, I could fight traffic

421
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,002
送他去贝内克家
and bring him down to Beneke now,

422
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:19,033
但如果我们...  岂不是更方便
but wouldn't it be easier if we...

423
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:21,026
好  好的  很好
Right. Okay. Good.

424
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,056
我们在家等你
So we'll meet you at the house.

425
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,043
好的  再见
Okay. Bye.

426
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:28,047
你为什么这么做
W-Why are you doing this?

427
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:32,034
她不让我见你
She's just trying to k-keep me from seeing you,

428
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:34,011
你却帮着她
and you're helping her.

429
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:36,078
不  不是这样的  儿子
No. No, son. I mean, your--

430
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:40,041
你妈妈...  她是有理由的
your mother... she has her reasons.

431
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:42,041
什么理由
What reasons?

432
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:47,018
就是
They're, uh...

433
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:49,059
就是
Well, they're...

434
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:55,056
这个不太好讲  但是
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate, but--

435
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:59,033
我是说  每件事情都是有
I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story.

436
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:02,053
两个方面的
Always. But, uh,

437
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:04,083
她呢
she, uh...

438
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:12,014
现在只能这样
This is just how it has to be.

439
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,054
暂时的  好吗
For now. Okay?

440
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:17,021
听我说  家毕竟是家
And, look, your home is your home,

441
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:19,061
你属于那里  好不好
and that is where you belong, okay?

442
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:21,045
可是你也属于那里
But it's where you belong.

443
00:29:21,048 --> 00:29:24,022
爸  那是你的家
Dad, it... it's your house.

444
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:26,015
汉克姨夫  玛丽姨妈
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie--

445
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:28,009
所有人都知道你没有做错
everybody knows that you hen't done

446
00:29:28,012 --> 00:29:30,043
任何事情
anything wrong.

447
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:34,026
大家都站在你这一边
Everybody is on your side.

448
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,083
这个  这
Well, it's... it's...

449
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:42,060
这不是哪一边的问题
it's not about taking sides, though.

450
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:46,017
你怎么  你怎么能让她这样对你
How can... How can you let her treat you like this?

451
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:47,068
-好了  -你  你怎么
- Now, come on. - How... How...

452
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:49,078
怎么可以听之任之
How can you just... just take it?

453
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:52,088
听我说  好不好  无论怎样
Just listen to me, okay? No matter what,

454
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:54,038
这些事情绝不会影响到
all of this has nothing to do

455
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,005
我们对你的感情
with how we feel about you, okay?

456
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:59,089
我们俩都非常非常的爱你  知道吗
We both love you very, very much, okay?

457
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:03,089
你和你妹妹永远都是第一位的  永远
You and your sister will come first, always.

458
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,003
别难过了
Now, come on.

459
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:11,036
让我们
Let's, uh...

460
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,093
乐观地看待这件事
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?

461
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:16,036
我们两个都要
Both of us.

462
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,030
振作起来
Let's just buck up.

463
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:23,006
然后我送你回家
Then I'll take you home.

464
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,086
我得先
Uh, let me first just

465
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:31,053
去下这老旧的卫生间
hit the old bathroom here.

466
00:30:49,024 --> 00:30:51,001
你好
Hello.

467
00:30:51,004 --> 00:30:53,001
下午好  很高兴见到你们
Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.

468
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,051
-索尔·古德曼  -很高兴见到你
- Saul Goodman. - Nice to meet you.

469
00:30:54,055 --> 00:30:57,078
你不会就是夜间广告里的那个律师吧
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?

470
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:59,078
快打电话给索尔!
Better call Saul!

471
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:04,009
我的口头禅哦
I get it all the time.

472
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,036
我们来此是就马戈街9809号房屋出售一事
We're here to discuss the sale of the property

473
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,099
进行磋商
at 9809 Margo.

474
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:11,053
我知道  老客户了  是吧
I get it. Flat-fee clients. Am I right?

475
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:14,086
好了  伙计们  你们今天交好运了
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

476
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,067
我所代理的客户不愿透露姓名
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.

477
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,034
况且  对我们而言
However, for our purposes, you might just as well

478
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:23,084
赚大钱才是重点
visualize a large bag of money.

479
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:27,097
他希望在今天通过现金交付购置你们的房产
This individual wants to buy your house today, for cash.

480
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:30,094
-现金交付  -我理解  在此种经济环境下
- Cash? - Cash. I know. In this economy.

481
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,001
事实上  我客户
In fact, the money is

482
00:31:32,001 --> 00:31:34,028
账户上的余额已所剩无几
already burning a hole in my client's account.

483
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,055
就这点你可以咨询加德纳先生
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.

484
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:37,072
我已经把账务明细给他看过了
I've shown him all the pertinent financials.

485
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:40,018
这也是为何我们坐在这里的原因
It the only reason we're sitting here.

486
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:42,012
很好
Fair enough.

487
00:31:42,015 --> 00:31:44,079
我们需要签订一些合同并进行公证
We, uh, get a few papers signed and notarized,

488
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:46,046
现在就可以进行
we can take care of this right now.

489
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:49,049
我也会在今天下午将钱汇给你们
In fact, I can wire you your money this very afternoon.

490
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:53,033
但唯一值得商榷的是
There's just one little hair in the soup--

491
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,063
价格
uh, the price.

492
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:02,030
我们觉得87.5万很合理
We feel 875 is very fair.

493
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:05,074
但我想或许还有点回旋余地
But I suppose there's always a little, uh, wiggle room.

494
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:10,018
那么就40万
Well, you wiggle us on down to 400,

495
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:12,001
你们商量下吧
and you got yourselves a deal.

496
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:15,091
40万  开什么玩笑
400,000? What is that, a joke?

497
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:18,038
不是  这是我的报价
No, that's my offer.

498
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:20,088
还不到一半的价钱
That's less than half price.

499
00:32:20,092 --> 00:32:23,012
光翻新就差不多花了那么多
We put almost that much into the renovations alone.

500
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:25,042
我们就别再讨价还价了
Why don't we just cut the clown act

501
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:28,002
你就报个实价吧
and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?

502
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:30,086
40万  这是我最后的报价
400,000. That's my final offer.

503
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:32,079
-真是浪费时间  -无稽之谈
- Well, this is a waste of time. - Ridiculous.

504
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,003
你怎么会觉得
How could you possibly imagine

505
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:35,076
-我们会接受这个报价呢  -得了吧  杭
- that we would entertain this? - Come on, Hon.

506
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,076
我也不清楚  只是在听闻制毒室后
I don't know. I just thought some allowance was in order

507
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,000
觉得能在价格上有所减让
once I heard about the meth lab.

508
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:42,003
该实验室据说在地下室
The one that used to be in the basement.

509
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:45,044
我看了下你们签署的告知声明
I looked over your signed disclosure statements,

510
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,020
并没有提到制毒室
and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.

511
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:50,021
没有  没有  在这里提到了白蚁检测
No. No. Oh, you got your termite inspection.

512
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:53,004
这个不错  但还是没有制毒室
That's good. But no meth lab.

513
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:56,028
有人会将掩盖重罪的行为
Now, some would call that fraud

514
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:58,065
称之为欺诈
in service of concealing a felony.

515
00:32:58,068 --> 00:33:00,085
我则是个开明的人
I, myself, am more open-minded.

516
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:03,092
但这事有点棘手
But it is tricky.

517
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:06,089
别误会  我很赞同你们的作法
Don't get me wrong. I applaud your c--.

518
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:09,022
我是指  向买家隐瞒
I mean, good try in sneaking

519
00:33:09,026 --> 00:33:12,012
该房子曾用于制毒这招很聪明
a meth-contaminated property past the buyer.

520
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:14,089
可以卖个好价钱
I mean, you know, could've been a good deal for you.

521
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:18,009
太可惜了  如今我可以
Too bad. Now, I could

522
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:21,060
提起诉讼  将此房产无期限扣押
file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely,

523
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:24,006
我也可以提起刑事诉讼
or I could start some criminal proceedings.

524
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,020
但这都是你我所不乐于见到的
But I don't think any of us want that now, do we?

525
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:30,060
怎么样  顾问  你同意吗
How about it, counselor? Do you concur?

526
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,062
到了
Ta-da.

527
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:53,049
拿好  儿子
Here you go, son.

528
00:33:55,022 --> 00:33:58,092
好了  这里又不是魔鬼岛
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

529
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:06,053
行了
Okay. Ooh.

530
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:13,037
我们到了
Here we go.

531
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,015
好啊
Oh. Hey.

532
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,029
你好
Hello.

533
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:24,040
我带了披萨来
Uh, mmm. Brought pizza.

534
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:27,060
是啊  可是我在做饭了
Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

535
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:30,037
好吧  那放冰箱里吧
Oh, okay. I'll just, uh, put it in the fridge.

536
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:33,001
第二天吃更可口
It's even better the next day, huh?

537
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:37,038
你来啦  宝贝
Hi, honey.

538
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,099
抱歉
Sorry.

539
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:45,019
是啊
Yeah.

540
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:48,066
好吧  斯凯勒
All right. Skyler...

541
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:54,076
亲爱的  我们楞在这里算怎么回事
Honey, what kind of example do we want to set here?

542
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,043
对吧  我们不能坐下来
Right? I mean, can't we at least just sit down

543
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:59,063
一起吃块披萨吗
and eat a piece of pizza together?

544
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:03,050
不能像成年人一样处理问题吗
Just to hash things out like adults? You know--

545
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:06,037
需要讨论的
We have...discussed

546
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:08,037
我们都已经讨论过了
everything we need to discuss.

547
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:11,014
我想我已经说得很清楚了
I thought I made myself very clear.

548
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:17,011
我放下就走
I got dipping sticks.

549
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:41,072
这是沃尔特的临时号码
You've reached Walt's temporary number.

550
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:44,002
请留言
Please leave a message.

551
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:50,016
今早我出去拿报纸
When I went out this morning to get the newspaper,

552
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:53,023
发现屋顶上有张披萨
I saw a pizza on our roof.

553
00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:56,010
你知道是怎么回事吗
Would you know anything about that?

554
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:59,057

天啊  说曹操曹操到

杰西  房子卖掉了
Jesse, the house has been sold.

573

新房东随时会来

574
00:38:14,046 --> 00:38:16,079

579
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:09,058
老天
Jeez.

580
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,046
操  不

上帝
Oh, God.

它已干涸
It was dead

583
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:09,081
♪ You see, I've been through the desert ♪

584
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:12,004
♪ on a horse with no name ♪

585
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:16,018
♪ It felt good to get out of the rain ♪

586
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:18,068
♪ in the desert ♪

587
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:56,052
是我  有些事要告诉你
It's me. There's something you should know about.

588
00:43:58,058 --> 00:44:00,052
稍等
Hold on.
