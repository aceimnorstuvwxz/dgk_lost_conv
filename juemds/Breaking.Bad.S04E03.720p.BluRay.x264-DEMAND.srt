狗娘养...
Son of a--

第四季 第三集
S04E03: Open House

3
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,190
我不会走的
I'm not leaving.

4
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,300
沃尔特  我是不会走的
Walt, I'm not leaving.

5
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,570
天呐
Oh, my God.

6
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,200
我能听见你的手机铃声
I can hear your cell phone ringing!

7
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,700
真是莫名其妙
This is ridiculous. I can't--

8
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,870
你怎么了
Uh, what is going on with you?

9
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,360
我给你留了23条语音信息
I've left you, like, 23 messages.

10
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,259
然后呢
And?

11
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,340
然后呢
And?

12
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,540
我得跟你谈谈洗车店的事
We need to talk about the car wash.

13
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,270
斯凯勒  我现在没时间谈这个事
You know, Skyler, now is not a good time for me, okay?

14
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,440
咱们改日吧
Can we talk about this later?

15
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,620
不行  不改日
No, okay? We can't.

16
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,770
你为什么...
Why are you do--

17
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,240
我的天
Oh, Jesus.

18
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,440
出什么事了
What happened?

19
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,170
没事  撞了一下而已
Nothing. I just bumped it. That's all.

20
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,670
好吧  我必须进屋去
Okay, I'm-- I'm coming in.

21
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,570
说说  到底是怎么回事
Okay, exactly what happened?

22
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,500
情况很复杂  我也不想讨论这事
It's complicated, and I don't wish to discuss it.

23
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,570
不用你操心
It's none of your concern.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,700
你有危险吗
Are you in danger?

25
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,670
沃尔特  你看着我的眼睛
Walt, I need you to look me in the eye

26
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,700
马上告诉我  你有危险吗
and tell me right now, are you in danger?

27
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,270
这样吧
You know what?

28
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,540
就说我现在要操心的事情
Let's just say that I have a hell of a lot more

29
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,530
非常多
on my mind right now

30
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,470
顾不上谈论洗车场的事情
than thinking about buying a d--- car wash.

31
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,640
好吧
Okay.

32
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,300
所以  你能别烦我吗...
So if you could just please...

33
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,200
好吧  那我们去找警察
Okay. Then we go to the police.

34
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,640
什么
What?

35
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,930
都招了吧
We tell them everything--

36
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,670
你是一名毒贩  担心自己的生命安全
that you're a drug dealer afraid for your safety,

37
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,870
以及你家人的安全
and the safety of your family.

38
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,870
还有  你需要帮助
...and you need help.

39
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,100
你有选择的余地吗  沃尔特
What choice is there, Walt?

40
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
选择余地
What choice?

41
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,070
如果你有危险
If you're in danger--

42
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,670
那就绝对应该...
...then it would be absolutely--

43
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,600
停吧  停吧
Stop, stop, stop.

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,700
你一直在说我"有危险"
You keep saying that word "Danger"--

45
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,230
-"危险"  -但你刚才说...
- Danger. - But you just said--

46
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,170
不  我从没用过这个词
No, and I have never used that word.

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,870
我说情况很复杂
I said things were complicated,

48
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,280
然后你就失态了
and then you flew off the handle.

49
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,890
对  那还不是因为看你伤成这样
Yeah, I flew off the handle when I saw that, okay?

50
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,600
你是怎么受的伤
Where'd that come from? Hmm?

51
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,270
洗澡时摔倒了吗
A fall in the shower?

52
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,310
知道吗  你太过偏激了
Uh, this is just so passive-aggressive, you know? I--

53
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,910
太过偏激
Passive-aggressive? Are y--

54
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,380
我就两天
I go two days

55
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,440
没给你回电话  就两天
without returning your phone calls, two days,

56
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,770
就出了一点小插曲
and I have one minor little incident,

57
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,340
然后你就告诉我
and now you're telling me to--

58
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,470
我应该去找警察自首  天呐
I should turn myself in to the police, for God's sake.

59
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,150
-小插曲  -对
- A minor little incident? - Yes.

60
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,270
什么小插曲
What minor little incident?

61
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,040
我跟一个同事起了争执
I had an argument with a co-worker.

62
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,640
好吧
Okay?

63
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,440
然后呢
And?

64
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,310
我们起了争执
I had an argument.

65
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,340
当时在酒吧里
We were in this bar,

66
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,900
我们正在讨论
and we were discussing

67
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,670
一个特别的商务策略
a particular business strategy,

68
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,670
争论过于激烈  无法控制
and it got heated and out of control,

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
然后他就打了我  就一下
and he hit me-- once.

70
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,140
我没有还击  因为他比我岁数还大
And I didn't retaliate because he's a much older man.

71
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,570
仅此而已
And that's it.

72
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,670
你和人在酒吧打架
You were in a bar fight?

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,300
对  斯凯勒
Yes, Skyler,

74
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,230
我和人在酒吧打架
I was in a bar fight.

75
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,470
那你没事吧
So you're okay?

76
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,940
真没事
Really?

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,270
对  我没事
Yes. I'm okay.

78
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,700
我觉得  到最后
And I think in the end

79
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,940
这其实是一件好事
it may have been a good thing, actually,

80
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,970
因为我们就可以冰释前嫌了
because we were able to clear the air

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,570
就是  互相尊重
and, you know, mutual respect.

82
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,170
所以
So--

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,770
冷冻青豆
Frozen peas.

84
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,240
什么
What?

85
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,840
消肿效果最好
It's the best thing for the swelling.

86
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,700
其实没怎么肿
Oh, it's not really swollen.

87
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,620
只是...
It's--

88
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,850
没有青豆
No peas.

89
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,710
你连冰都没有
You don't even have ice.

90
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,990
我去买点青豆  还有冰
I will get peas. I will get ice.

91
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,970
青豆和冰  我记下来了
Peas and ice. I'm writing it down.

92
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,840
我要你...
I need you to...

93
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,090
向我保证
promise me that

94
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,050
-如果你有危险的话...  -斯凯勒

95
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,200
答应我
promise me.

96
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,260
没问题
Absolutely.

97
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,970
那么...
So--

能给我单独介绍这房子吗
Any chance of a top-off?

103
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,900
我们应该能帮上吗
Oh, I think we can help you out there.

104
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,000
你感觉如何

很漂亮  很宽敞
Oh. Very nice. Very open.

106
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,700
同感  很敞亮

107
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,700
充足的日光照射
A whole lot of natural light.

108
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,500

很高兴见到你

111

113
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,300
后边还有一个独立的小屋
That's a non-attached casita out in back,

114
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,190
可以作为办公室或者会客厅

你已经结婚了吧
I see you're married.

118
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,670
不  离了  刚离不久

119
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,000
恶习难改
Old habits.

120
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
对不起
Oh. I'm sorry.

121
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,470
有孩子吗
Any children?

122
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,050
有  是个小男孩

多大了
Oh. How old?

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,740
五月份满四岁
Uh, he turned 4 in May.

125
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,670
双子座  肯定会喜欢后院的
He's a Gemini. Would love this yard.

126
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,000
足够搭一座儿童爬梯
Oh, well, plenty of space for a jungle gym,

127
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,870
附近的幼儿园也很棒
and the neighborhood preschool is fantastic.

128
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,440
我还是想在家教艾利
Oh, well, I think Eli is going to be home-schooled.

129
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,330
那也很好
Oh, well, great.

130
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,890
不是因为什么宗教因素
Not for religious reasons or anything.

131
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,740
我只是想让他得到足够的重视
I just want to make sure that he's getting enough attention.

132
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,190
他还是会去参加夏令营之类的
He'll still go to summer camp and whatnot,

133
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,210
和孩子们一起玩
you know, play dates.

134
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,050
我可不想让他不合群
I don't want him to be socially awkward.

135
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,450
当然  非常理解
Oh, no. Makes a lot of sense.

136
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,740
他考分非常高
He tests very highly--

137
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,150
优于96%的孩子
96 percentile--

138
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,610
但是右脑和左脑
but that whole right brain, left brain--

139
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,677
也得要平衡才行
you want those in balance.

140
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,670
你说小屋里铺有管道  对吗
You said the casita has plumbing?

141
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,100
我出去会踩到泥
I will go out with clay,

142
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,700
所以需要自来水冲洗
so I need access to running water.

143
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,240
那水管是为小型卫生间配备的
Well, it's pipe fitted for a quarter bath,

144
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,670
做工作室再合适不过了
so make a perfect studio.

145
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,800
这行得通
This could work.

146
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,640
是医生的主意
H---, that's the doctor's plan

147
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,560
让她的病人得到放松
to get her patients at ease,

148
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,870
你懂的
if you know what I mean.

149
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,240
可是  护士  我可不是
But, nurse, I'm not one--

150
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,300
我回来了
Hello! I'm back!

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,970
汉克
Hank?

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
在呢
Yeah.

153
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,740
我跑了三家不同的商店
I had to go to three different places

154
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,240
去找你喜欢的润肤霜
to get the moisturizer that you like,

155
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,470
还是买到了
but I got that,

156
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,540
还买了你要的啤酒和薯片
and I got your Shiner Bock and your chips,

157
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,260
还忍不住买下了
and I couldn't resist.

158
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
《梦幻足球》的全攻略
The Complete Encyclopedia to Fantasy Football.

159
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,770
上面列了所有近期排名
Look, it has all the latest rankings.

160
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,870
玛丽  我说的是奇多斯薯片  不是炸多斯
Marie, I said Chee-tos, not Fritos.

161
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,100
什么
W-Wait. Uh--

162
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,540
我一直说的是奇多斯
I must have said Chee-tos, like, ten times.

163
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,100
你想要我给你写下来吗
You need me to write it down for you?

164
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,380
不用  我也不想你这么挑剔  你这暴脾气
No, and I don't need you to be mean about it, either, Mr. Grumpy.

165
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,240
我只是说说而已
Well, I'm just saying, you know.

166
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,040
我说的是奇多斯  奇奇奇
I said Chee-tos. Ch-Ch-Ch sound,

167
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,540
实在不可能会听成炸多斯吧
virtually impossible to confuse Chee-tos with Fritos,

168
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,540
在我看来
it seems to me.

169
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,670
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

170
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,070
回商店
Uh, back to the store, I guess.

171
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
给
Here.

172
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,980
选拔赛还有两个月呢
And the draft's not for two months,

173
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,870
这排名毫无用处
so this is useless.

174
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,440
难以置信
Can you believe it?

175
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
什么
What?

176
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,760
什么  这玩意儿
What? This.

177
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,040
你过去也总觉得这地方会被窃听
Well, you always thought this place could be bugged.

178
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
现在有答案了
Now we know.

179
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,280
是啊  可我不喜欢
Yeah, well, I don't like it.

180
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,380
这有碍工作
It's a violation of the work space.

181
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,710
我想是吧
Yeah, I guess.

182
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,580
想做点什么吗
Want to do something?

183
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,280
做什么  比如
Do something? Like what?

184
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,580
开卡丁车
Go-karts?

185
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,770
卡丁车  什么
Go-karts? What--

186
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,680
体育馆那边有跑道
Yeah, there's a track down by the Coliseum.

187
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,010
挺好玩的
It's pretty fun.

188
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,440
不了
No.

189
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,980
其实  我
Actually, I have--

190
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,910
我要去见人
I have a meeting, so--

191
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,630
好吧  无所谓
All right. Whatever.

192
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,940
改天吧
Rain check?

193
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,940
当然了
Yeah, Sure.

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,310
你近来如何
How you doing?

195
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,980
挺好的
Good.

196
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,010
是吗
Yeah?

197
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
你还好吗
You okay?

198
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,140
有什么要跟我聊的吗
Is there, uh, anything we should talk about?

199
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,880
你的眼睛怎样了
How's your eye?

200
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,110
没事
Yeah, it's fine.

201
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,180
有什么要聊聊的吗
Anything we should talk about?

202
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,210
无论如何
For what it's worth...

203
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,540
替你把那废人给铲除了
getting the shit kicked out of you...

204
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,710
不是说你已经适应了  但是
not to say you, uh, you get used to it, but...

205
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,140
你确实有点适应了
you do kind of get used to it.

206
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,080
四个字  美甲沙龙
Two words-- nail salon.

207
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,480
洗钱再合适不过了
It's perfect for money laundering.

208
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,580
这个行业  现金流充足
It's a high volume cash-preferred business

209
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,940
雇佣的是正经员工
with a discreet work force.

210
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,910
我是说  不需要她们保什么密
I mean, nobody does "Mister, me know nothing"

211
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,180
比莫卡佳阿波夫人和她手下妞们好过多了
better than Mrs. Mookjaiaporn and her gals.

212
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,780
古德曼先生
Mr. Goodman--

213
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,980
请叫我索尔
Saul, please. Now,

214
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,540
对这店里的女主人
for the lady of the house--

215
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,240
请给点掌声
drum roll, please--

216
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,540
可以终生享受
how about a lifetime supply

217
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,440
法式光疗甲和去角质服务
of French manicures and enzyme peels?

218
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,080
没错  来吧  犒劳自己下
Ah, yeah. Go ahead, pinch yourself.

219
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,940
古德曼先生  我们不打算买美甲沙龙
We're not buying a nail salon, Mr. Goodman.

220
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,740
我们要买洗车店
We're getting the car wash.

221
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,940
抱歉  我是不是听岔了
I'm sorry. Am I missing something here?

222
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,010
你不是已经试过了吗
I mean, didn't you already try that?

223
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,990
没错  沃特告诉我
Yeah. I mean, Walt told me

224
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,140
你跑去找那个博格丹
that you, uh, took a run at this Bogdan character,

225
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,150
他根本无心跟你讨价还价
and he wrestled you into submission with his eyebrows.

226
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,880
要价一千万美元  对吗
10 million, that was the asking price, right?

227
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,240
显然他有提高到两千万了
Apparently, he upped it to 20.

228
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,210
这交涉得可真好
Ha ho! Nice negotiating.

229
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,310
你谈崩了  这很正常
Yeah. I-- Hey, you bombed. It happens.

230
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,440
打电话给我就对了
You were smart to call me.

231
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,680
现在  你们就退居幕后  放轻松
Now-- Uh, you just sit back, relax,

232
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,030
让专业人士来接管
and let a professional take over.

233
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,780
是谁
Who is that?

234
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,980
来找我的  抱歉
That's for me. Excuse me.

235
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,420
你想干什么  我在谈正事
What do you want? I'm in a meeting.

236
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,710
你之前怎么没想到
Why didn't you think of that before?

237
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,980
这不是我...
It's not my--

238
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,740
我谈正事呢
I'm in a meeting.

239
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,580
修尔可以借用下厕所吗
Can Huell use your bathroom?

240
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,840
修尔是谁
Huell?

241
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,080
当然  上楼就是
Uh, sure. The top of the stairs.

242
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,480
他很快的
He'll be quick.

243
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,640
是胃不舒服
It's a stomach thing.

244
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,940
我们说到哪儿了
So where were we?

245
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,020
专业
Professionalism.

246
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,640
对了  这人要是不想卖  就不会卖的
Yeah. Um, so the guy won't sell, he won't sell.

247
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,210
我可不干
I don't accept that.

248
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,010
他不卖  我可不干
I don't accept that he won't sell.

249
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,440
我想他是缺乏足够的
I-- I think he just lacks the proper...

250
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:49,658
动机
motivation.

251
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,210
动机
Motivation. Oh. Uh,

252
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,280
是说我们常说的"动机"吗
as in "Motivation" motivation?

253
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,990
我就是确认下  我们说的是一码事
I mean, just so we're on the same page here.

254
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,880
你是说我们开一个他无法拒绝的价钱吗
You're saying we make him an offer he can't refuse?

255
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,540
那可就太戏剧性了  不行
Nothing so dramatic as that, no.

256
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,140
动机
Motivation.

257
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,880
转变态度
Attitude adjustment.

258
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,710
你这妻子太精明了
This one, she's a keeper.

259
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,310
查账可以构成动机
Well, an audit can be highly motivating.

260
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,180
我有个朋友是管税收的
I know a gal over at Tax and Revenue.

261
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,510
让她拿着博格丹的账本查上10分钟
You give her ten minutes on this Bogdan fella's books,

262
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,110
保证让他大难临头
she'll have his sky raining frogs.

263
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,980
不行  这事不能引起税务部门注意
No, we don't want to draw any unwanted tax attention.

264
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,360
不然博格丹卖给我们之后他们还会查
We don't want them looking at us after Bogdan sells.

265
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,110
好吧  非法移民突查怎么样
All right. How about an I.C.E. raid?

266
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,040
他厂里一定有非法劳工
You know he's got illegals working over there.

267
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,340
不可能没有
I mean, he just has to.

268
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,930
我们不想连累无辜的穷苦人  不行
We are not getting a bunch of poor innocent people in trouble, no.

269
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,180
对  而且这些工人你们接管以后也要用
Yeah. And also, you're going to need them after you take over. Tck.

270
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,210
那恐怖主义如何
Hey. How about terrorism?

271
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,510
"胡佛探员  我跟你说"
"Oh, Agent Hoover, I got to tell you,

272
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,380
"最近那家洗车厂"
"I've seen some real Islamic comings and goings

273
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,780
"总有伊斯兰人来来去去"
over there at the car wash."

274
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,280
对  缠着头巾的男人开着货车
Yeah, I mean guys in turbans pulling up in vans

275
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,300
诸如此类的
and stuff like that. Ha ha!

276
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,374
索尔  博格丹是罗马尼亚人
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.

277
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,010
好吧  不过是随便说说
Okay, well, we're... we're just spitballing here, so...

278
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,612
行  这招总可以
Okay, there's always...

279
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,410
"你这地方不错"
"You got a real nice place here.

280
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,880
"出什么事的话就太可惜了"
A shame if something happened to it."

281
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,280
这个角度
That angle.

282
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,580
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

283
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,440
用暴力手段吗
Violence?

284
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,140
调整态度
Attitude adjustment.

285
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,510
不行  这可不行
Oh, no. That? No.

286
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,180
我说的绝对不是这个意思
That is not at all what I meant.

287
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,880
我...我们不做那种事
I... We do not do that.

288
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,810
我们不是那种人  对不对
That's not who we are, right?

289
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,510
对  不行  不行
Yeah. No. No.

290
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,510
她说的对
No, she... she's right.

291
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,910
你们看  这么明显的事还用我说吗
Look, do I need to state the obvious?

292
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,230
这片的洗车厂肯定不下十几家
I mean, there's got to be dozens of car washes in this area.

293
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,110
谁说非要这一家了
Who says it has to be this one?

294
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,280
我说的
I do.

295
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,180
我说非这家不可
I say it has to.

296
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,310
为什么
Why?

297
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,610
我就要这家
I just do.

298
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,640
天...
G....

299
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,310
这倒说明问题了
Well, that clears things up.

300
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,940
我不喜欢那个人  博格丹
I don't like him... Bogdan.

301
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,440
他跟我甩脸色  对你无礼
He was condescending to me, rude about you,

302
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,540
我不喜欢他
and I do not like him.

303
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,040
就这么简单
Simple as that.

304
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,280
我最欣赏爱憎分明的女人了
Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do,

305
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,060
可是  在我们这行
but, uh, in this business,

306
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,740
沃尔特可以帮我作证
and Walt can back me up on this,

307
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,610
最最要紧的就是
the number 1 rule is...

308
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,280
不要感情用事
don't take things personally.

309
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,740
你刚才说...对我无礼是什么意思
What do you... What do you mean, rude about me?

310
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,480
他话里话外说你...
Something along the lines of...

311
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,140
不够个男人  不敢自己去见他
you weren't man enough to face him yourself.

312
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,420
什么
What?

313
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,020
说你让你女人替你做生意
That you had to send your woman to do your business for you.

314
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,640
好吧  身为你们的律师
Okay, uh, speaking as your lawyer,

315
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,910
我得把这话说在前面
I'm going to go on record

316
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,264
这不是个好主意
and say this is a bad idea.

317
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,440
我建议你们不要...
Now, I advise against...

318
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,680
就要这家了
It's this one.

319
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,980
好吧  那...
Okay. So, uh...

320
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,380
我们要做的就是  想出一种非暴力的
all we have to do is think of a nonviolent,

321
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,380
不会引起怀疑的方法  买下洗车厂
unsuspicious way to purchase the car wash

322
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,500
还要...  不伤及无辜
that... that... that protects the innocent

323
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,310
又不能花费2千万美元
and doesn't cost $20 million.

324
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,010
你们一个一个说
Don't everybody speak at once.

325
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,540
你好
Hi.

326
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,810
有什么我可以帮忙解答的吗
Can I answer any questions?

327
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
好多勺
Oh. Spoons.

328
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,910
没错  这家主人热爱收藏
Yes. The owner is quite the collector.

329
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,080
是不是很独特
Aren't they something?

330
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,010
50个州的都有
One for each of the 50 states.

331
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,640
事实上波多黎各不能算州
Uh, Puerto Rico is technically a territory.

332
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,110
说不定他们觉得...
You know, maybe they were thinking...

333
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,380
没准儿呢
some day.

334
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,680
没有地下室是吗
Uh, so no basement.

335
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,610
抱歉  没有地下室
No basement. Sorry.

336
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,040
这是个问题  我弟弟是维和部队的
That's a problem. My brother's in the Peace Corps,

337
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,510
18个月之后才回来
and won't be back for 18 months,

338
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,610
我答应帮他保存家具
and I said I'd hang on to his furniture.

339
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,410
如果你需要储物空间
Well, if you're looking for storage space,

340
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,910
这里的阁楼很宽敞
there's an attic area that's sizeable.

341
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,840
阁楼更好
Oh. Huh. Well, an attic might be even better,

342
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,010
只要干燥就行
as long as it's dry.

343
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,480
-我带你去看看  -好
- Let's take a tour. - Okay.

344
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,210
其实呢  这边有宣传单
Actually, I have a handout for you.

345
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,810
信息上面都有
It has all the information.

346
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,710
我是斯蒂芬妮・多斯威尔
I'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way.

347
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,180
我叫夏洛克・布拉特纳
Charlotte Blattner.

348
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,440
很高兴认识你  夏洛特
So nice to meet you, Charlotte.

349
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,590
我也一样
You, too.

350
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,480
我就给他下了最后通牒
So I just told him point-blank...

351
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,740
"你是我丈夫  我爱你"
"You're my husband, and I love you.

352
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,110
"可是你已经53岁了"
"But you're 53 years old.

353
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,540
"这工作压力太大  太辛苦"
"This job has just gotten too stressful

354
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,340
"你该辞职了"
and difficult, and it's time to quit.

355
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,680
然后奇迹发生了  他听了我的
And, miracle of miracles, he listened.

356
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,080
他一定是对工作非常着迷
Still, what a fascinating career that must have been for him.

357
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,340
的确是
It was. I mean,

358
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,080
宇航局就像我们的第二个家
NASA was like a second family to us,

359
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,710
可是  你也知道
but, you know,

360
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,480
该开始新的旅程了
it was time for a new adventure,

361
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,280
靠着他的养老金
so, between his pension

362
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,510
和我做手模赚的钱
and the income I bring in from hand modeling,

363
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,740
我们过得比较富足
we're, you know, comfortable.

364
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,940
地板是重铺的吗
Uh, when were these floors redone?

365
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,180
两年前
Two years ago,

366
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,640
灶台是全新的
and the counters are brand new.

367
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,540
看得出来  洞石
I can tell. Travertine.

368
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,340
很好
Hmm. Nice.

369
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,840
有孩子吗
Any children?

370
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,340
没有
No.

371
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,540
我不太想要孩子
I don't really want kids.

372
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
我是不是不该有这种想法
Is that horrible for me to say, do you think?

373
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,380
没有啦  不是所有人都得生小孩的
Not at all. Not everyone has to have children.

374
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,140
你该去跟我丈夫谈谈
Hmm. You should talk to my husband.

375
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,610
这是垃圾处理机吗
Uh, garbage disposal?

376
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,719
瞧瞧这个
Check it out.

377
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,078
不错哦
Score, yo.

378
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,660
我非常喜欢你们家
I really love your home.

379
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,560
谢谢你  米米
Well, thank you, Mimi.

380
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,440
有一种欧洲风情
It has a... very European feel.

381
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,340
是吗
You think?

382
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,750
我在伦敦住过几年
Oh, I lived in London for years,

383
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,520
是的  感觉很熟悉
so yeah, this feels familiar.

384
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,950
伦敦什么地方
Where in London?

385
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,020
60年代我在厄普伍德驻守
I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s.

386
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,490
市中心
Right downtown.

387
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,800
可是我们通常都不在那里
But we were almost never there.

388
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,170
我丈夫是插画师  所以我们经常旅行
My husband is an illustrator, so we traveled a lot...

389
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,740
巴黎  意大利  丹麦
Paris, Italy, Denmark.

390
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,930
那都是在孩子上学以前的事了
it was before the kids were in school,

391
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,890
整理下行李就能到处走
so it was easy to pick up and go.

392
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,000
那时候我的小女儿  露西
That was before my youngest, Lucy,

393
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,360
还未被诊断出患有心内膜炎
was diagnosed with endocarditis.

394
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,350
可怜的孩子
Oh, my.

395
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,990
老天  那是不是
Gosh, is that, uh--

396
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,360
是心脏瓣膜发生了细菌感染
It's a bacterial infection of the heart valves.

397
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,730
那  确实会...
It's-- Yeah, it can be--

398
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,030
真遗憾
Mmm. That's terrible.

399
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,760
她现在还好吗
Is she all right?

400
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,030
你的女儿
Your daughter.

401
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,630
她现在身体可好
Is she okay?

402
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,760
还好  多谢关心
Yes. Th-Thank you.

403
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,760
医生给她装了人工瓣膜
Um, the doctor's put her on a prosthetic valve,

404
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,900
所以她...  露西挺好的
so she's-- Lucy's fine.

405
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,860
能跑能走  还能骑马
Running and walking, riding horses.

406
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,960
谢天谢地
Well, thank goodness.

407
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,330
是啊  我们很幸运
Yeah. We're...very lucky.

408
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,260
请留步  小姐
Excuse me. Miss?

409
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,090
房子不错  多谢
Very nice. Thank you!

410
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,960
我报警了
I just called the police.

411
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,990
好的
Okay, then.

412
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,410
我知道你偷了那把勺子
I know you stole that spoon.

413
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,450
什么勺子  你说什么呢
What spoon? What are you talking about?

414
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,520
你是个小偷
You're a thief.

415
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,060
-你再说一遍  -还是个谎话精
- Excuse me? - And a liar,

416
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,410
乱编故事  你是有什么问题吗
making stories up about yourself. What's wrong with you?

417
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,630
拜托  你才哪里不对劲吧  女士
No. What's the matter with you, lady?

418
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,430
你最好给我闪开
You better just back off, okay?

419
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,230
我丈夫是毒品管制局的探员
My husband is a DEA agent.

420
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,730
我还以为他是名宇航员或是插画家呢
I thought he was an astronaut or an illustrator.

421
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,490
你最好能够自圆其说
You better get your crazy lies straight.

422
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,790
听好了  肥婆
You know what, fatty?

423
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,390
你该庆幸我有约在身  没工夫跟你耗
You are so lucky that I am late for an appointment.

424
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,590
你哪儿都别想去
You're not going anywhere.

425
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,510
放开我的包
Let go of my purse.

426
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,060
-放手  -等警察来了再说
- Let go! - Not until the police get here.

427

放手  你给我放手
Let go of it! Let it go!

428
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,630
放手

429
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,030
放  手
Let it...go!

430
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,530
你  给我等着
You are in big trouble.

431
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,690
喂
Yeah.

432
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,260
等等等  慢点说
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

433
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,290
慢

慢着点  从头开始
Slow down. Start from the--

435
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,930
你
You--

436
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,260
你在哪里
You're where?

437
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,730
你他娘...
Why the f--

438
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,960
你干什么
Why are you--

439
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,560
你老毛病又犯了  是不是
Are you seriously doing this to me again?

440
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,990
老天
Jesus, just st--

441
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,790
你别哭行吗
Would you stop crying?

442
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,830
我去找人解决  别乱动
I'll make a phone call. Just sit tight.

443
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,290
你在哪里被抓的
Where do they got you?

444
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,560
好消息  警官和房主谈过了
So good news. The officer spoke to the homeowners,

445
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,100
他们不会提起诉讼
and they're not going to press charges.

446
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,796
很好  那我也不会
Good. I won't, either.

447
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:42,760
好的  那么  我们走吧
Okay, then, so we're good to go.

448
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,060
走吗
You ready?

449
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,790
玛丽  你想回家吗
Marie, you want to go home?

450
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,190
玛丽
Marie?

451
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,400
(索尔・古德曼 ，律师)
(SAUL GOODMAN,ATTORNEY AT LAW)

452
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,800
你好  我是斯凯勒・怀特
Yes, it's Skyler White

453
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,990
找索尔・古德曼  谢谢
calling for Saul Goodman, please.

454
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,690
对  事关重大
Yes, it is important.

455
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,260
谢谢
Thank you.

456
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,590
抱歉  结果一样
Sorry. Same as before.

457
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,479
但这样不行啊
But this is not right.

458
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,030
你不能让我关门  不能这样
You cannot shut me down. You cannot do this.

459
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,030
沃利兹先生  我由里至外地检测了您的污水
Mr. Wolynetz, I've checked your waste water inside and out.

460
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,430
也检测了排水沟
I've checked your runoff gutters,

461
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,990
但这里的污染物含量更高
and now out here more contaminants--

462
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,800
有氨  丙酮
ammonia, acetone,

463
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,860
苯和硝基苯
benzene, nitrobenzene.

464
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,860
不不不  肯定是误会
No, no, no. This is a mistake.

465
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,440
加里人呢  他会告诉你
Where is Gary? He will tell you

466
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,760
我的肥皂很好  很环保
my soap is very good, very green.

467
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,160
不  不是你肥皂的问题
No, your soap is not the issue.

468
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,660
而是你过滤系统的问题
It's your filtration system.

469
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,090
最起码  你得更新一下
At the very least, you'll need to retrofit.

470
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,470
但如果你的污水将渗入地下水中
But if you're leeching into the ground water,

471
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,490
就此地看来是非常有可能的
which is looking like a real possibility here,

472
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,990
你就需要替换整个系统
you're going to need to replace your system entirely.

473
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,890
替换  你知道那要花多少钱吗
Replace? Do you know how much cost that is?

474
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,330
二十万
$200,000.

475
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,160
我知道这是道坎
Look, I understand it's a hardship.

476
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,290
我们也可以给你一份核准供应商名单
If you like, we can give you a list of approved vendors.

477
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,840
你要是准备着手更换
If you get going immediately,

478
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,590
请务必在四至五周内完成
your down time shouldn't be any more than four or five weeks.

479
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,290
好吧  抱歉  你说得对
Okay. So sorry. You're right.

480
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,610
即刻起  我们会加倍小心
From now on, we will be extra careful

481
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,480
减少污水排放
and, uh, clean.

482
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,460
停止污染  行吗
No more pollution, okay?

483
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,060
-可以了吗  -抱歉
- Yes? - No, I'm sorry.

484
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,100
目前的状况需要你暂停所有商业活动
The state requires you to suspend all commercial activity

485
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,860
直至此污染等级降低至最低标准
until these levels reach the mandated minimums.

486
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,660
那个加里人呢
Where is usual man? Where is Gary?

487
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,560
他被调配去拉斯克鲁塞斯了
He got transferred to Las Cruces.

488
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,690
如果你想申诉  可以联系...
If you'd like to file an appeal, you can contact--

489
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,630
我什么都没做错
I have done nothing wrong.

490
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,590
告诉我啊  为什么要我停止营业
Tell me, why you shut me down?

491
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,990
我犯了什么法
What laws did I break?

492
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,060
什么法  好几个呢
What laws? Several.

493
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,430
告诉我哪个法哪一条  不然我不接受
Tell me exact specific laws, or I refuse.

494
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,690
-要听具体的吗  -快说
- Specific? - Right now.

495
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,060
那个...
The--

496
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,290
给我说清楚
Tell me exact--

497
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,430
-具体是...  -快说
- The specific laws... - What laws?

498
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
等等
Hold on, okay?

499
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,460
别急  别急
Hold on. Hold on.

500
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,430
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

501
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,090
好了好了
Okay. Okay.

I-- I'm okay. Is there a problem?

531
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,940
没有  没事
No, no. Everything's fine.

532

天呐  又怎么了
Ah, Jesus. What now?

537
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,980
她抢银行了吗
She rob a bank?

538
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,740
老兄  最近好点了吗
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

539
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,580
能有什么怨言
Oh, well, can't complain, you know.

540

每天都好一点
Every day a little better.

541

那很好  你看上去气色不错
That's good. You're looking good.

542
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,040
谁让哥天生丽质呢
Yeah, well, handsome was never the hard part.

543
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
快进来坐
Come on in. Grab a seat.

544
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,380
东西随便扔哪里
Yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere.

545
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,110
听着
Listen, uh...

546
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,640
再次为那天的事感谢你
thanks again for the other day.

547
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,480
这整件事
You know, this-- this whole thing,

548
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,780
对她来说  很难接受
it's, uh, it's been hard on her.

549
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,280
不用谢  小事一桩
Forget it. Glad to help.

550
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,040
看来你在收集石头
So, rock collecting?

551
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,340
这些是矿石
They're minerals. Yeah.

552
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,180
实际上我在做目录
Uh, it's cataloging them--

553
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,980
分类  再加个标记
sort them, label them.

554
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,680
可够我忙的
Um, it's actually a lot of work.

555
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,540
是吗  看上去是的
Yeah? No, it looks like it.

556
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,710
找我什么事
So, what's up?

557
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,480
实际上  我是来找你帮忙的
Well, actually, I could use your help on something.

558
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,810
谋杀案  有可能还和毒品有关
Homicide, possibly drug-related.

559
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,440
你想让我跟进这个案子
You want my help on the case?

560
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,210
你当我是铁人吗
What am I, Ironside?

561
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,280
不  可你是个缉毒警察  熟悉本地的行家
No. But you're a drug cop who knows the local talent,

562
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,340
而且我还帮过你一个忙
and you're a pal I just did a favor for,

563
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,040
所以就让我占用你几分钟时间
so let me pick your brain a second.

564
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,245
你对一个名叫
You ever come across a guy

565
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:40,950
盖尔・伯蒂彻有印象吗
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

566
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
没有
No.

567
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,210
有人朝他脸上射了一枪
Someone came along and shot him in the face.

568
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
然后呢
Okay.

569
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,440
没有强行进入的迹象
No signs of forced entry,

570
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,040
也不像是抢劫案
no signs of robbery.

571
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,740
这只是冲动犯罪
Okay, so it's a crime of passion.

572
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,040
和毒品有什么关系
Where's the drug angle?

573
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,140
我们在他房间发现了一本笔记本
We found a notebook at his place.

574
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,950
我觉得你会感兴趣  就为你复印了一份
I made a copy for you in case you're interested.

575
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,110
它看上去和制作甲基苯丙胺的实验室有关
Looks like it pertains to some kind of methamphetamine superlab.

576
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,640
这上面都是些科学公式
It's filled with scientific formulas

577
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,850
和化学药品清单及图案
and chemical purchase lists... drawings,

578
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,210
整页整页都是这些东西
pages and pages of this stuff.

579
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,040
这事肯定不简单  可我又不是行家
It looks big time, but I'm no authority,

580
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,480
所以来问你是否愿意看一下
so I wonder if you might take a look.

581
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,140
得了吧  提姆  说真的
Come on, Tim, seriously.

582
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,510
这算什么  对我的一种施舍
What is this, some kind of a charity thing?

583
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,410
我认为你的专家意见会有帮助
I thought your expertise could be useful here.

584
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,610
我现在躺着就像在三垒上
I'm lying here like, uh, third base,

585
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,280
每天的事情就是吃喝拉撒
living from bowel movement to bowel movement.

586
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,580
我自己都觉得我很没用
I'm not even useful to myself.

587
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,140
想问我的意见
Want my advice?

588
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,510
把它给史蒂芬・戈麦斯
Take this to Steve Gomez.

589
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,640
他会帮你的
He'll help you out.

590
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,870
要是我把这给史蒂芬・戈麦斯
I give this to Steve Gomez,

591
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,140
这就会变成毒品管制局的案子
and all of a sudden it becomes a DEA case.

592
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,480
这对我又有什么好处
What good does that do me?

593
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,880
要是你能看一眼
If you could just take a look,

594
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,240
告诉我这是什么
tell me what I got here,

595
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,910
我会十分感激的
I'd really appreciate it.

596
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,410
好吧
Whatever.

597
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,440
多谢了  老兄
Thanks, man.

598
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,310
慢慢来
You take it easy.

599
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,710
我还能干什么
That's what I do.

600
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,610
你那方法是不错
Well, it was a good try.

601
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,980
好啦  该睡觉觉咯
Here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah.

602
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,850
你真乖
Oh, you're great.

603
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,850
这么说
So...

604
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,680
美甲店还是比较靠谱的
Nail Salon sounded promising.

605
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,410
你觉得怎样
What do you think?

606
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,640
我觉得我们应该等等
I think we wait.

607
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,310
等等
Wait.

608
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,010
斯凯勒  都已经5个小时了
Skyler, it has been five hours.

609
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,380
他会打来的
He'll call.

610
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,740
等等吧
Ahem. Just wait.

611
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,010
等等吧
Just wait.

612
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,310
听着
Look.

613
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,110
这是个好办法  不错的主意
It was a good idea. It was a great idea.

614
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,280
可没作用
But it didn't work.

615
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:50,210
我们就当是吸取了一次教训
So why don't we simply chalk it up as a learning--

616
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,910
这里是怀特家
White residence.

617
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,140
你好啊  沃利兹先生
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

618
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,980
问我还有兴趣吗
Am I still interested?

619
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,610
那就得看情况了
Well, I-- I think that depends.

620
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,850
是的  87.9万美元是最初的报价
Yes, 879 was the original offer,

621
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,180
可现在我觉得贵了
but that seems high to me now.

622
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,910
我现在出价80万
Now I'm offering 800.

623
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,280
别  别  别  别这样
No, no, no. No, no. Don't do that.

624
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,470
-想知道原因  -别这样
- Why? - Don't do that.

625
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,630
因为你是一个令人讨厌的人  沃利兹先生
Well, because you're an unpleasant person, Mr. Wolynetz.

626
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,230
你非但对我不敬  还不尊重我的丈夫
You were rude to me and disrespectful towards my husband.

627
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,510
-斯凯勒  -还有就是
- Skyler-- - And furthermore,

628
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,950
我已经见过其他卖家了
I've met with quite a number of sellers,

629
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,050
这市场比我想象的要疲软许多
and the market seems much softer than I thought.

630
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,310
所以我报价80万
So 800.

631
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,110
你真是一派胡言  80万
You are talking crazy. 800?

632
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,480
你真是一个疯女人
You are a very, very crazy lady.

633
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,610
我知道你很失望
Well, I understand that you're disappointed,

634
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,580
可这是我的最后价位
but that is my final offer.

635
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,340
很遗憾我们没能做成交易
I'm sorry we couldn't make it work.

636
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,410
再见
Goodbye.

637
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,410
你在做什么
What are you doing?

638
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,310
我在谈判
I'm negotiating.

639
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
为什么这么做
Why?

640
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,910
因为我想花得少一点
Because I want to pay less.

641
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,310
便宜7.9万
$79,000 less?

642
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,780
就为这点小钱  你知道我现在一天赚多少
Who cares? Do you know how much I make in a day?

643
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,140
知道  所以我们才要谈判
Yeah, but that's the very reason we need to negotiate.

644
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,370
我们不希望因为我们
We don't want to arouse suspicion

645
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,600
没有讨价还价而引起猜疑
by not trying to get a good deal.

646
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,620
听着  我懂你的想法
Look, I get the logic. I do.

647
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,200
可你有点过分了
But you just went too far with it.

648
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,910
你居然骂他
You're calling him names?

649
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,580
我可没骂他
I didn't call him names.

650
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,950
我只是说他很无理
I said he was unpleasant.

651
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,540
他不会回你电话了
Well, he's not calling you back.

652
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,910
你不会真以为这会成功吧
I mean, you didn't honestly think that worked.

653
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,710
没错
Yeah, I do.

654
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,980
这下彻底没戏了
No way. Sorry. No.

655
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,980
该想想别的主意了  好吗
It's time to move on, ok?

656
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,910
我这就给索尔打电话
I'm going to call Saul.

657
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:42,110
我的电话呢
Where's my phone?

658
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,201
别接
No.

659
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:04,810
-为什么  -先别接
- What?  - No, just...

660
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:05,809
-还等什么
- What for?

661
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,880
等等  等等
Wait, wait.

662
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,940
等什么
For--

663
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:11,787
我的老天爷
Oh, my God.

664
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,580
您好
Hello.

665
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,820
您好  沃利兹先生
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

666
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,780
没人真正关心这些东西在哪里
No one's really paying attention to where these things are.

667
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,670
它们遍布世界各地  到处都是
I mean, there's got to be thousands of them all over the world

668
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,740
被装上渔船  朝咱们开来
and on boats coming right for us.

669
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,110
之后放进巨大的冷冻车上
And put on inside an ice cream truck,

670
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,910
开到旧金山
drive it into San Francisco.

671
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,040
我一点都不害怕被食人鱼吃掉
I'm not even that scared of burning up in cannibalism.

672
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,040
对于我来说  我只是担心
To me the things that-- thing that worries me

673
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,630
被蹂躏
is-- is getting trampled

674
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,210
或在铁丝网上被挤来挤去
or-- or shoved up against a chain link fence

675
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,040
因为你如果真的仔细想想的话
because if you really think about it,

676
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,740
如果你真的被压在铁丝网上挤来挤去
if you were against a chain link fence

677
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,260
你肯定会
and you've got a-- a lot--

678
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,170
我是说肯定有很多人想要逃离
I mean a lot of people trying to escape,

679
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,740
他们就会拼命向前推搡
pushing hard enough forward.

680
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,300
这不是开玩笑  你会被人挤穿过
It's not a joke. You're going to get squeezed

681
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,920
那道铁丝网
right through the chain links

682
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,980
就像华润或其它肉类
like Pla-Doh or some kind of soft meat.

683
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,610
这是不可避免的
Uh, and this is inevitable, okay?

684
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,180
这是你或我或任何人都无法阻止的
And there's nothing you or me or anyone can do about it.

685
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,380
如果这个铁丝网柱被死死地
And if the fence posts are stuck deep--

686
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,980
卡在水泥最深处
really deep with the cement way down inside the ground,

687
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,619
这种事绝对会发生的
then it's definitely happening to you.

688
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,015
就像墙上的血
Blood on the wall.

689
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:17,140
中了
Yeah. Bitch.

690
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,540
有人被杀了  肯定有人被杀了
Somebody got shot. Somebody probably got shot.

691
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,850
就像那些肉
Like soft meat, man,

692
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,910
就像那些
right through--

693
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,850
被铁丝网挤穿的肉
being squeezed through there like soft meat.

694
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,310
就像那些被铁丝网挤穿的肉
Like soft meat, right through the chain.

695
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,010
被铁丝网挤穿
Right through the-- Right through the chain.

696
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,440
无可避免
It's-- It's inevitable. Just--

697
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,240
来钱啦
Money!

698
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,180
太好了
Ohh, nice.

699
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,140
敬
To...

700
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,380
洗车和洗钱
clean cars and clean money.

701
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,610
干杯
Hear, hear.

702
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,340
我说什么来着
You see?

703
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,440
咱们能买到这个洗车场
I told you we'd get it.

704
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,210
是吗
Did you?

705
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,910
说真的  你这仗干得可真漂亮
Seriously, that was really great work.

706
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,480
佩服
It's impressive.

707
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,610
谢谢
Thank you.

708
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,710
索尔也帮了点小忙
And Saul finally came through.

709
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,540
他找了那个人
Well, I mean, he found the guy, right?

710
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,510
是啊  他找了那个人
Well, yes, he found the guy,

711
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,240
但每步都是我给的指示
but I told him what to do and what to say.

712
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,280
对 你说的对  这才是最难的地方
You're right. That's the hard part.

713
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,010
但是索尔也挺有用
But yes, Saul was, uh... finally useful.

714
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,380
得给他点奖励
Throw him a bone.

715
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,950
天呐
Oh, my God.

716
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,410
这酒真的很好喝
This is truly amazing.

717
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,970
这瓶最起码得值320美元
Yes, well, it better be at $320 a bottle.

718
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,510
什么
What?

719
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:44,580
波尔罗杰牌  维斯顿・丘吉尔先生香槟
Cuvee Pol Roget Sir Winston Churchill.

720
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,210
很明显是他最爱的香槟酒
Apparently, it was his favorite champagne,

721
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,480
所以他们以他的名字命名
so they just named it after him.

722
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,280
你是如何支付的
How did you pay for it?

723
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,010
我不明白你的意思
What do you mean?

724
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,000
现金  我付现金
Ah. No. Cash. I paid cash.

725
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,810
不是  我是在问你沃尔特・怀特
No, I'm-- I'm asking how did you, Walter White,

726
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,240
一名失业的前中学教师如何能买得起
an unemployed schoolteacher, pay for it?

727
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,640
你该怎样解释
How do you explain it?

728
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,040
斯凯勒  我买的时候没人看到我
Skyler, no one saw me.

729
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,910
卖给你的人绝对看到了  但这不是重点
Whoever sold it to you did, and that's not the point.

730
00:43:09,912 --> 00:43:12,747
重点是我们破产了  记得吗
The point is we're broke, remember?

731
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,710
我是指  我还在等你的失业救济支票
I mean, I'm waiting for your unemployment check to come

732
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,410
来支付电话费
so I can pay the phone bill.

733
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,410
我要求电力公司延长我们的交款期
I asked for an extension from the power company.

734
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,680
为啥  因为严格意义上讲  我们没钱
Why? Because on paper, we have no money.

735
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,840
你多虑了
You are completely overreacting.

736
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,820
我不会为用微不足道的方式庆祝而道歉
I'm not apologizing for wanting to celebrate in some small way.

737
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,340
我不是要求你道歉  沃尔特
I'm not asking you to apologize, Walt.

738
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,360
我是要求你变得聪明点
I'm asking you to be smart.

739
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,415
我就买了一瓶香槟
I bought one bottle of champagne,

740
00:43:36,415 --> 00:43:39,810
就一瓶  斯凯勒
one single bottle, Skyler.

741
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,240
我付了现金  仅此而已
I paid cash. That's it.

742
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,130
也只能就此打住
That's all it takes, okay?

743
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,240
想想水门事件吧
I mean, look at Watergate.

744
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,710
就那么一小块胶带
One... One little piece of duct tape

745
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,980
-留在门上   -我的天呐
-left in a door  -Oh, my G--.

746
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,964
把美国总统拉下马
...brought down the President of the United States.

747
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,770
什么  我成尼克松了吗
What, I'm Nixon now?

748
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,910
不是  我的意思是
No, what I'm saying is

749
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,270
细节决定成败
the devil is in the details, okay?

750
00:43:55,273 --> 00:43:58,522
只要我们的故事里有一点点疏漏
One little mistake, one slip-up in our story,

751
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,594
都会把我们俩毁了的
that could ruin us.

752
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,040
好吧
Fine.

753
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,380
得赶紧把证据消灭掉
Got to destroy the evidence.

754
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,080
每次当我看到眼前这个画面
When I look at this-- this image

755
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,740
这份档案的一部分
that is part of the record,

756
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,280
我很担心这对于我们来说
I am very concerned about what sort of distraction

757
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,610
将是多大的干扰
that can be,

758
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:34,980
不管是怎样的标识
whether it's from any sort of signage

759
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,780
尤其是这样每五秒钟更换一次的标识
but especially a signage that's changing every five seconds.

760
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,940
谢谢
Thank you.

761
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,550
还有其它问题吗
Any other questions?

762
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,310
在这级第二个位置有个请求
We have a motion and a second on the floor

763
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,680
同意此项上诉

00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,740
已经有五位提出反对意见  上诉失败
There's five no's, and that motion fails.

768
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,380
在此我想为此教育广播公司及卢波公司的
I would like to make a motion to uphold the decision

769
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,910
调查与决定提出支持议案
and the findings of the EBC and the Lupo.

770
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,650

We have a motion and a second

by Councilor Cooke. Any questions?

772
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,140
没有  所有人都同意
I see none. All those in favor,

773
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,550
此全员同意意味着否定上诉
signify by saying yes to deny the appeal.

774
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,750
同意者请举手并示意同意
