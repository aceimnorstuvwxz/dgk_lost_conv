00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,057
-你好  又见面了  -你好
-Well, hello again.  - Hi!

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,027
希望我们没有太迟
I hope we're not too late.

11
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,047
不不不  时候刚好
No, no. Perfect timing.

12
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,038
斯坦  这是我丈夫沃尔特
Okay, Stan, this is my husband Walt.

13
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,084
你好  沃尔特  很高兴见到你
Hi. Good to meet you, Walt.

14
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:53,011
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:55,045
-桑迪亚实验室的人是吧  -没错
- Sandia Laboratories, huh?  -Yeah.

16
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:58,018
我听说你们研发了不少好东西啊
I hear some pretty fascinating stuff goes on out there.

17
00:00:58,022 --> 00:01:00,012
你知道的
Ah, well, you know--

18
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,068
最近在忙什么
Working on anything you can talk about?

19
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:04,055
我寻思着是不是某种大型空间激光器
I'm picturing giant space lasers.

20
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:05,085
我说的没错吧
Am I right?

21
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,069
说实话  我干的活你肯定觉得无聊
Honestly, what I do would bore you senseless.

22
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,066
大型空间激光器
Oh! But giant space lasers?

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,006
这个听上去挺棒的
Now, that sounds cool.

24
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,013
下次管理层开会  我会给他们提一提
I'll have to bring it up at our next staff meeting.

25
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:14,066
那我得要提成哦
Well, just remember I get a cut.

26
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:15,099
没问题  我们一言为定
All right, that's a deal.

27
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,066
就这儿了  亲爱的  怎么说
So this is it, honey. What do you say?

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,023
-你想参观一下吗  -当然
- Do you want to take a tour?  - Sure.

29
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:21,036
来吧
Okay.

30
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:26,007
这样吧  你们单独慢慢看
Look, how about I give y'all some privacy?

31
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,087
我去车里打几个电话
I'll go out to the car and make a few calls.

32
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:30,054
你们慢慢看  不着急
Take as much time as you need.

33
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,081
好的
All right. Good.

34
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:32,087
谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

35
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,005
人不错  不是急性子
He's actually a nice guy. He doesn't push.

36
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:39,011
对
Yeah.

37
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,018
你看到了  这里
So, as you can see, there's, uh...

38
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:44,008
这里挺通风
there's a kind of flow going on here.

39
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,069
-客厅也很棒  -不错
- It's a nice big living room.  - Yeah.

40
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:49,079
这是饭厅
And this is the dining area.

41
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:52,009
-饭厅是吧   -没错
- Ah, the dining area. Right.  - Yes.

42
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,039
还有
Oh, and, uh--

43
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:57,059
-游泳池  -游泳池不错
- It's got a pool.  - Oh, pool is nice.

44
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,066
后院有点小
Backyard could be a little bigger.

45
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,093
可以在这儿吃早餐
Um, and-- Oh, there's a breakfast bar

46
00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:07,057
-感觉不错  -挺好
- kind of dealie here which is nice.  - Jesus.

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,057
你看  厨房也挺宽敞的
And, uh, I don't know, the kitchen's really spacious

48
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:13,078
电气用具也基本齐全
and, you know, got good appliances, and--

49
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,028
有几间卧室
How many bedrooms?

50
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:16,081
三间
Three.

51
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,081
给你说过了
Told you.

52
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:19,038
户型都不错
They're all pretty good size, and--

53
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:21,095
这是第一间
Oh, this is the first one here.

54
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:24,065
后面还有两间
And then there's two more at the back.

55
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,045
只有三间卧室吗
Only three bedrooms?

56
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,086
怎么说也得五间吧
I think we're gonna need at least five.

57
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:29,086
不觉得吗
Don't you think?

58
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,046
-五间  -是的
- Five?  - Yeah.

59
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,026
什么  我像这么能生的吗
What? Do I look like I'm about to drop a litter?

60
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,083
-不  不  -喂
- No, no, no, no, no, no.  - Dude.

61
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:40,003
不  我们最终会有三个孩子
No, we'll have three kids total, eventually.

62
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:42,053
但需要一间空房来当书房
But we'll need a spare room for a study

63
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:45,000
这样我就能在家工作  你也可以写作
so that I could work at home and you can write.

64
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,001
所以我觉得
Nah, I don't--

65
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:49,098
这儿小了点
I don't think this is gonna be enough.

66
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:54,085
好吧  那酒窖呢
Okay. Um, what about a wine cellar?

67
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:57,025
咱们肯定不能
I mean, we certainly cannot be expected

68
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:58,095
没有酒窖吧
to live without a wine cellar.

69
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,032
很好笑
Very funny.

70
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:03,032
我只是觉得咱们应该把眼光放高一点
I just think we need to set our sights high is all.

71
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:04,099
至少比这地方高
At least higher than here.

72
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:08,029
沃尔特  这是个很好的社区
Walt, this is a good neighborhood.

73
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:10,006
这里有所很棒的小学
It's got a good elementary

74
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,086
所以高中也应该不错
and supposedly a very good high school.

75
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,023
相信我
And believe me--

76
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:17,003
我都仔细比对过了
'cause I have definitely looked everywhere--

77
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,060
这儿价格真的不错
for our price range,

78
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,020
简直是物美价廉
this is as good as it gets.

79
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:22,031
价格再高点也不是问题
Well, then let's stretch our price range.

80
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,064
真的
Truly.

81
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,068
我的意思是  干嘛买个初级的房子
I mean, why buy a starter house

82
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:29,048
然后过个一两年又得搬家
when we'll have to move out in a year or two?

83
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,038
你赢彩票了吗
Did you win the lottery and not tell me?

84
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,075
我是认真的
I'm serious.

85
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:37,055
别这样  干嘛这么谨慎
Come on. Why be cautious?

86
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:39,039
人往高处走
We've got nowhere to go but up.

87
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:57,040
绝

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:57,040
命

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:57,040
毒

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:57,040
师

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:57,040
第三季

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:57,040
第十三集

93
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,086
喂
Yeah.

94
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,023
沃尔特  看见我们了吗
Walter, you see us?

95
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,066
看见了
Yeah, I see you.

96
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,027
我希望你能从车上下来
I'd like you to exit your vehicle

97
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,054
然后慢慢朝我们走过来
and start walking toward us.

98
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:05,027
然后呢
And then what?

99
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,051
然后我需要
I'm gonna need some...

100
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:11,058
保证
some kind of assurance.

101
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,062
我保证我能从这直接杀了你
I assure you I could kill you from way over here,

102
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:16,058
如果这能让你感觉好点的话
if it makes you feel any better.

103
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:15,015
沃尔特  你最近可没闲着
Walter, you've been busy.

104
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,055
把你的手
You want to put your arms out

105
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:18,028
抬起来
to the sides for me, if you would?

106
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:37,080
你知道我从周四开始就没睡觉
You know I haven't slept since Thursday?

107
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:41,001
我整晚都在外面给你擦屁股
I was out all night cleaning up after you.

108
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,094
我需要睡眠
I need my sleep.

109
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:46,078
你叫我别姑息折衷
You said no half measures.

110
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,021
没错
Yeah.

111
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:51,092
你要这么曲解  我也没办法
Funny how words can be so open to interpretation.

112
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:56,019
车修了吗
You get your car fixed?

113
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:57,066
还没
Not yet.

114
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,079
最好把车修好
You're gonna want to get your car fixed.

115
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,089
先把目前这档子事解决了再说吧
Let's see how this goes first.

116
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,067
情况恶化了吗
Has your condition worsened?

117
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,087
什么
Excuse me?

118
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,004
你的身体状况  恶化了吗
Your medical condition, has it grown worse?

119
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,014
据我所知  没有
Not that I know of, no.

120
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:48,097
-耳鸣吗  -不
- Is there a ringing in your ears?  - No.

121
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,031
是否看见亮光或是幻听
Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices?

122
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,041
我很好  多谢关心
I'm quite well, thank you.

123
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:57,028
不  显然你不好
No. Clearly you are not.

124
00:08:57,032 --> 00:09:00,082
有理智的人  可不会干出这样的事
No rational person would do as you have done.

125
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,079
解释一下吧
Explain yourself.

126
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,073
我的合伙人差点被人打死
My partner was about to get himself shot.

127
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:12,090
我不得不进行干涉
I intervened.

128
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,020
这种没用的瘾君子
Some worthless junkie--

129
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:18,051
你冒着把我们全暴露的危险  就为了他吗
For him you intervene and put us all at risk?

130
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:20,011
这种卑鄙小人
Some contemptible junkie

131
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:22,031
叫他和解  却连8个小时都管不住自己
who couldn't keep the peace for eight hours?

132
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:25,034
没错  他是管不住
That's right. He couldn't.

133
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:28,001
因为你的两个毒贩杀了个11岁的孩子
He was angry because those two dealers of yours

134
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:30,055
所以他很生气
had just murdered an 11-year-old boy.

135
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,032
我听说了
I heard about it.

136
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:35,009
他应该让我来处理
He should have let me take care of them.

137
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:37,002
也许吧
Maybe.

138
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:38,083
但也许他认为
Then again, maybe he thought

139
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:40,056
就是你下的命令
it was you who gave the order.

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,033
你在质问我
Are you asking me

141
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:49,014
是不是我下令杀那孩子的
if I ordered the murder of a child?

142
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:53,041
我永远不会那么问
I would never ask you that.

143
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,071
平克曼现在在哪里
Where is Pinkman now?

144
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:05,025
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

145
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,099
至少是千里之外了
A couple of time zones away, at least.

146
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:13,026
当然这只是我的猜测
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

147
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,036
因为他有够花一辈子的钱了
He has enough money to last forever.

148
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,086
他知道自己要亡命天涯
He knows he needs to keep moving.

149
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,083
你找不到他的
You'll never find him.

150
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,070
这倒不见得  沃尔特
I don't know, Walt.

151
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:24,020
你忘了我是干什么的吧
It's what I do, after all.

152
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,041
现在跟他没关系了
He's out of the picture.

153
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,047
我救了他的命  是我欠他的
I saved his life. I owed him that.

154
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:33,054
现在我跟他两清了
But now he and I are done,

155
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,088
不正合你意吗
which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it?

156
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:44,099
我一直认为你是个务实的人
You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man,

157
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:48,066
如果可以  我想和你谈谈选择的问题
so if I may, I would like to review options with you

158
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:52,080
你有两个选择
of which it seems to me you have two.

159
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,000
选择一
Option A--

160
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:56,067
此时此地  把我干掉
you kill me right here and now.

161
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,097
很明显这对你来说再容易不过了
Apparently, I have made that very easy for you.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,037
你可以杀了我  没有目击者
You can kill me-- no witnesses--

163
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,078
再花上几个星期  几个月的时间
and then spend the next few weeks or months

164
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:09,058
追查杰西·平克曼的下落  把他也干掉
tracking down Jesse Pinkman, and you kill him too.

165
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:12,078
在我看来  这毫无意义
A pointless exercise, it seems to me.

166
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:14,062
不过这就是选择一
But that is Option A.

167
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:16,012
选择二呢
What is Option B?

168
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:17,059
我继续制毒
I continue cooking.

169
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:20,079
你我都把平克曼给忘了
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

170
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,099
就当什么都没发生过
We forget this ever happened.

171
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:26,000
就当是我们互惠而长远的合作中
We consider this a lone hiccup

172
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:30,090
的一次小插曲
in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement.

173
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:34,027
我比较倾向选择二
I prefer Option B.

174
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,088
你需要个新助手
You'd need a new assistant.

175
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,035
-我可以去找  -不
- I could get right on that.  - No.

176
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,072
这次我来选人
This time, I choose.

177
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,061
你的车
Your car.

178
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:09,074
去修一下
Get it fixed.

179
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,021
知道了
Yeah.

180
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,042
至于吗
Really?

181
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:21,058
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

182
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,045
谢谢
Thanks.

183
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,062
很高兴我能回来
It's good to be back.

184
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:31,039
那么  我们开始吧
Well, shall we?

185
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,053
当然  盖尔  开始吧
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

186
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,060
犀牛怎么样
What about that rhinoceros?

187
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:48,020
你觉得那适合当宠物吗
You think he'd make a good pet?

188
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:49,094
-不适合  - 不适合吗
- No.  - No?

189
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,024
你觉得当你叫它时
Don't you think if you called to him,

190
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:52,078
它会跑过来吃饭吗
he'd come running for his supper?

191
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,002
我打赌它会跑来
I'll bet he would. I bet he'd come running.

192
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:58,021
你好傻  爷爷
You're silly, Pop Pop.

193
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,058
确实有点
Well, a little.

194
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:01,038
但它可能会把东西都撞翻
But he'd probably knock everything over.

195
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:03,002
而且它还有个大鼻子
Plus, there's that big nose of his.

196
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:05,055
那不是鼻子  是角
That's not a nose. That's a horn.

197
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:07,029
是吗
Is that so?

198
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:09,019
它鼻子很小的
His real nose is little.

199
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:13,066
跟你在一起我能学到好多东西
I learn all kinds of things being with you.

200
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,013
好了  乖孙女  这些给你
Okay, June Bug, these are for you.

201
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:21,047
剩下的呢
What about the rest?

202
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,070
剩下的是我的
The rest are for me.

203
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:23,070
才不是呢
No, they're not.

204
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:25,047
你太老了  不适合玩气球
You're too old for balloons.

205
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:28,078
再老都不为过
Oh, you're never too old for balloons.

206
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:31,081
来抱抱  看到你妈妈了
Give me a hug. Oh, I see your mama.

207
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,018
快去吧
Don't keep her waiting.

208
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:34,018
再见  爷爷
Bye, Pop Pop.

209
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:35,048
再见  宝贝
Bye, baby.

210
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:40,016
我求求你  你不要杀我  你千万不要杀我

211
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,078
我不能死  我有三个小孩子

212
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:43,058
求求你  求求你  不要杀我
Please. Please, no.

213
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,001
我求你你不要杀我

214
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:04,063
周  你欠我个解释
Chow, do you have anything you want to tell me?

215
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,096
感谢上帝你来了
Thank God you're here.

216
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,073
他们囚禁我
They keep me prisoner.

217
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:10,007
他们囚禁你
They keep you prisoner.

218
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,037
我没为他们做任何事
I don't do nothing for them ever.

219
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,064
他们想逼我就范
They try and make me.

220
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,071
我拒绝了
I say no.

221
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,074
他们偷走了我的化学材料
They steal my chemicals.

222
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:19,074
我阻止不了
I can't stop them.

223
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,001
我只是个商人
I am businessman.

224
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:22,001
你是个商人
You're a businessman--

225
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,005
外面的那位女士
The lady out front--

226
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,095
女士  你还在那里吗
Hey, lady, are you still there?

227
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:27,058
问她还在不在
Ask her if she's still there.

228
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:30,036
潘  你还在吗

229
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:33,016
我当然还在  我还能去哪里啊

230
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:38,016
你们在干什么呀  我得赶回家了
我有小孩子要照顾  我老公一定急死了

231
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:41,016
你钱付不够  我前面死了个男人耶

232
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,080
她还在
She says yes.

233
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,050
她会开车吗
How's her driving?

234
00:18:46,054 --> 00:18:48,087
开车  她开车开得好吗
Driving. Is she good behind the wheel?

235
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:51,031
很好  她开得很好
Good. She's good driver.

236
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:54,025
有驾照吗  可靠吗
Licensed? Dependable?

237
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:55,071
她有辆凯美瑞
She has a Camry.

238
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:58,008
很好
Good.

239
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:04,082
卡车明天一早就会到这儿
The trucks will be here first thing in the morning.

240
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,032
我强烈建议你
I strongly recommend

241
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:08,069
下次记得回我们电话
that you return our calls next time.

242
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:10,093
让她载你去医院吗
So have her drive you to the hospital.

243
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,040
鞋忘拿了
She's gonna need her shoe.

244
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,008
他们从哪截的货
Where did they cross?

245
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:32,025
好像是拉雷多
Laredo, looks like.

246
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:34,068
但他们没有派出最厉害的手下
They didn't exactly send their A players.

247
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,079
如你所言  只是帮派行为而已
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.

248
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:42,009
他们在找弱点下手
Probing for weakness.

249
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,015
貌似没成功
Well, they didn't find any.

250
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:50,006
有平克曼消息吗
What about Pinkman?

251
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:54,012
我正在调查
I'm making inquiries.

252
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:11,035
好了  第二步
Done. That's two?

253
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,015
关上吧
All right. Let's close it up.

254
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:23,006
拉下来
Bring it down.

255
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,020
准备
Ready?

256
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,040
很好  好了
Great. Okay.

257
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:32,061
搞定
We're good.

258
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,005
你可以摘掉面具了
You can take your mask off now.

259
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,073
那家伙不走吗
Does that guy ever leave?

260
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,099
不走
Nah.

261
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,083
什么时候开始的
When exactly did that start?

262
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:00,037
刚开始的
It's new.

263
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,007
我们...
We had a...

264
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:07,061
替代你的那位  出了点小插曲
We had a little drama with the person you replaced.

265
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:10,051
我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

266
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:12,025
不必  没事
No, it'll be fine.

267
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:14,001
会好起来的
Things will continue to smooth out,

268
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,088
一切都会好起来的
and, yeah, it'll be fine.

269
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:25,036
顺便问下  和我工作你有什么顾虑吗
By the way, if you're at all worried about working with me...

270
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,033
没  没有
No, I'm not.

271
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,020
因为不论上次我有什么缺点
Because whatever my shortcomings last time,

272
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:33,000
我希望从现在开始  一切都能完美
I intend for things to go perfectly from here on out.

273
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:34,050
所以  如果有什么...
So, if there is...

274
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:36,074
盖尔  你很棒
Gale, you're great.

275
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,000
真的
Seriously.

276
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,034
我只是...
I just...

277
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:41,094
所有事情  你怎样想
However you like things to be done

278
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:44,081
我们就怎样做
is exactly how we are gonna do them.

279
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:46,011
绝对的
Period.

280
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:48,062
从现在起
From here on out.

281
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:52,035
所以呢
So, uh...

282
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:54,005
请指导我吧
please teach me.

283
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,086
好
Okay.

284
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:27,034
盖尔  很高兴见到你
Gale. It's good to see you.

285
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,024
福林先生
Mr. Fring.

286
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:30,081
真是...
Wow. This is, uh...

287
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:32,028
我该事先打个电话的
I should have called first.

288
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:34,028
没有打扰到你吧
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

289
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,075
没有  完全没有
No. No, not at all.

290
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:37,098
请进
Please come in.

291
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:42,079
要喝点什么  薄荷甜酒怎么样
Can I offer you something? Creme de Menthe?

292
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:45,079
不  不必  谢谢
Oh, no. No, thank you.

293
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:48,032
请恕我这般打扰
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

294
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:51,096
一点也没打扰
Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.

295
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:57,043
我有事要和你商量
I need to talk to you about something...

296
00:23:57,047 --> 00:23:58,074
一件很紧迫的事
something rather pressing.

297
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:06,038
我想知道  在必要的情况下
If push came to shove, I was wondering

298
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:10,035
你多久之后可以独立制毒
how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself.

299
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,085
在助手的协助下
You and an assistant.

300
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:14,035
为什么
Why would...

301
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:19,029
为什么会有这种必要
Why would push come to shove?

302
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:20,086
沃尔特有没有跟你提起过
Has Walter ever talked to you

303
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:24,028
他是为何入这行的吗
about why he got into this particular line of work?

304
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,027
我猜我以为是  佣金丰厚的缘故
I guess I assumed it was because it pays so well.

305
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,087
这是自然  不过具体来说
Oh, it is, but specifically.

306
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,000
他有和你说过他的健康问题吗
Has he ever spoken to you about his health problems?

307
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:39,054
这不奇怪
Oh. I'm not surprised.

308
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:41,028
他不太喜欢和人交流
He's a very private person.

309
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:45,082
他有什么健康问题
What exactly are his health problems?

310
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:47,028
他患有癌症  时日无多
He's dying of cancer.

311
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:50,092
所以他才来干这个
It is why he does this,

312
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:52,026
为了养家糊口
to provide for his family,

313
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,049
他已经做到了
which he has accomplished.

314
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:55,066
他的家人以后将衣食无忧
They will never want for anything.

315
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,013
他保证了这一点
He's seen to that.

316
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:05,027
他还有多长时间
how long does he have?

317
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,090
这就是问题所在
That is very much the question.

318
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,084
他不愿意谈这件事
He does not want to talk about it,

319
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:12,034
每次我跟他提起...
and every time I bring it up with him...

320
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,015
我认为他还没完全接受这个事实
I don't know that he's fully accepted the reality of it.

321
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,045
不是我冷血
And not to sound cold-blooded,

322
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,085
我毕竟是个生意人
but I am running a business here.

323
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,042
不  我能理解
No, I... I understand.

324
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:27,082
我在这里...
I have...

325
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:29,059
投入了很多资金
a very large investment in this.

326
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:30,083
总开销非常大
There is so much overhead

327
00:25:30,086 --> 00:25:32,076
我负担不起停工
that I can't afford to shut down,

328
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,056
哪怕一个星期也不行
not even for a week.

329
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,073
所以你能明白我的担忧
So you understand my concern

330
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,094
以及对不停工的迫切希望吧
and my desire for continuity?

331
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:42,074
明白  完全明白
I do, absolutely.

332
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:44,077
只要沃尔特愿意
Now, I intend to keep Walter on

333
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:47,034
我会留他一直工作
as long as he wants,

334
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,015
前提是他身体情况允许
assuming he's physically up to it.

335
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:54,052
但他既然不能或者不愿意
But as he cannot or will not

336
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:57,049
告诉我他还可以工作多久
tell me how long that might be,

337
00:25:57,052 --> 00:26:02,019
我不得不为最坏的情况做好打算
I must prepare for the worst-case scenario.

338
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:05,016
最坏的情况
The worst-case scenario.

339
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:15,054
我想如果我们能...
I suppose if we had...

340
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:18,054
再在一起制几批货的话
at least a few more cooks together...

341
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:20,061
现在还没准备好吗
You don't think you're ready now?

342
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:26,005
他真的是...
Well, he is such a...

343
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:28,099
大师级的
a master.

344
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,072
总有我学不尽的知识
There's always more for me to learn.

345
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:39,028
可是我想如果我们能再...
But I'm thinking that if we had...

346
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:43,083
比如  一两批货
say, one or two more cooks?

347
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:51,047
一批
One more...

348
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:52,071
我想就可以了
I guess, would do it.

349
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:53,074
应该能行
I suppose.

350
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,085
我相信你  盖尔
I believe in you, Gale.

351
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:00,082
我知道一旦时机成熟
I know that when the time comes,

352
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,052
你一定会准备好的
you will be ready.

353
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,090
怎么了
What's up?

354
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,041
沃尔特
Walt?

355
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,093
那个...
Is there, um...

356
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:37,076
清理催化剂床有什么特殊诀窍吗
any particular trick to purging the catalyst bed?

357
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:42,033
没有  直接清理就是了
No, it's pretty straightforward.

358
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,080
到时候我会告诉你
I'll show you when we get there.

359
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:12,012
什么事
Yeah.

360
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:13,076
告诉他我在开会
Tell him I'm in conference.

361
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,057
你看不到我在开会吗
Can't you see I'm in conference?

362
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,004
我在找你的一名客户
I'm looking to find a client of yours.

363
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:28,074
希望你可以帮个忙  给我他的地址
I was hoping you could help me out with an address.

364
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:30,021
哪位客户
Which client?

365
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:32,071
杰西·平克曼
Jesse Pinkman.

366
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,051
电话簿上找找杰西·平克曼
Jesse Pinkman in the phone book Jesse Pinkman.

367
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:37,048
这个人怎么找呢
Hmm. How would one track him down?

368
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:38,058
我也想知道
I wonder.

369
00:28:42,046 --> 00:28:43,079
你还没走
You're still here.

370
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:45,036
你给我仔细听好  索尔
I need your full attention, Saul.

371
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,073
我要杰西·平克曼当前的行踪
Jesse Pinkman current whereabouts.

372
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:49,083
你赶紧告诉我  就可以继续享受你这个
The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back

373
00:28:49,086 --> 00:28:51,060
天知道是什么的鬼东西
to whatever the hell this is exactly.

374
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,033
你当我是高年级纠察员吗  "当前的行踪"
What am I, eight-grade hall monitor? "Current whereabouts."

375
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:56,077
迈克  我实话跟你说
Let me tell you something, Mike...

376
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,034
你老实躺着
You are good right there.

377
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:02,055
我也找个舒服地方坐
Now, let's both get comfortable.

378
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:09,029
我说我要找平克曼
Now, when I say I'm looking for Pinkman,

379
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:11,059
你我都心知肚明  对吧
we both know why, don't we?

380
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:13,046
你给我装糊涂
And you pretending otherwise

381
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,066
只会浪费我的时间
only wastes my time

382
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,040
只会惹恼我
and serves to annoy me.

383
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:19,020
迈克
Mike, uh,

384
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,080
律师这行有它的规矩
there are rules to this lawyer thing.

385
00:29:21,084 --> 00:29:23,004
是吗
Is that right?

386
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:24,038
是
Yeah.

387
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:27,014
律师-当事人保密特权  这很重要
Attorney-client privilege. That's a big one.

388
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:29,031
我也同样在为你保密
And that's something I provide for you.

389
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,054
所以如果我出卖平克曼
So if I give up Pinkman, well,

390
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:33,025
你就得问了
then you're gonna be asking

391
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:35,008
索尔这么轻易出卖他们
"Old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy.

392
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:36,088
怎能保证他不出卖我呢
What's to keep him from giving me up?"

393
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:39,079
看吧  这样哪还有信任
You see? So then where's the trust?

394
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:44,039
我可以把你活埋到沙漠里  你信吗
I trust the hole in the desert I'd leave you in.

395
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:48,026
也对
Yeah, it's an argument.

396
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,070
所以...
So...

397
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:55,074
别逼我把你打成瘸子
don't make me beat you till your legs don't work.

398
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:57,087
告诉我哪里能找到他
Now tell me where to find him.

399
00:29:57,091 --> 00:30:00,021
识时务者为俊杰
You know it's the right thing.

400
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:06,098
我不能说  迈克
I can't tell you, Mike.

401
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:09,062
好吗
All right, I--

402
00:30:09,065 --> 00:30:12,009
听我说  我要是告诉你了
Look, if I was to tell you,

403
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:14,075
我就...我良心过不去
I just-- I couldn't live with myself.

404
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,012
对不起
I'm sorry.

405
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,083
但是万一我把地址
But who's to say I didn't write

406
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:23,006
写在日程表上
the address down in my day planner?

407
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,007
或是草稿纸上
Or on a scratch piece of paper somewhere?

408
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,060
出于职业需要  我记下了地点
Who's to say I didn't write down a location

409
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:32,027
但结果不小心被人看见了
strictly for my own professional use?

410
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:38,071
请别碰我桌上任何东西
Do not touch anything on my desk.

411
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:41,068
我要出去一下  给我自己泡杯雀巢咖啡
I'm gonna leave the room, make myself a Nescafe.

412
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:01,043
我这是在罩着你
I'm just looking out for you, that's all.

413
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:03,050
就像是母鸡护小鸡
Like a mother hen.

414
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:05,017
相信我
Believe me,

415
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:07,027
洗钱已不是过去那回事了
money laundering ain't what it used to be.

416
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,084
真怀念八十年代
God, do I miss the '80s.

417
00:31:08,088 --> 00:31:10,071
你这是白费功夫
Wasting your time.

418
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:13,031
我要买洗车场  说完了
I'm buying the car wash. End of story.

419
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:16,032
看一眼这地方  你就会喜欢上的
Well, one look at this place, you're gonna fall in love, so--

420
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,070
怎样  我说的没错吧
Huh? Was I right?

421
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:36,000
打着灯笼也找不到
Where else are you gonna find

422
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:38,017
这种只收现金  而且还这么好玩的地方
a cash-only business that's this much fun?

423
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,074
除非是那种[挂按摩院招牌的]妓院
Unless we're talking massage parlors,

424
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,051
不过我没找到
and I don't see it.

425
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:43,068
进来瞧瞧
Shall we?

426
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:52,055
你玩过激光枪战游戏吗
You ever actually play laser tag?

427
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:56,046
是个不错的有氧运动  而且还能朝小孩子开枪
It's good cardio. Plus you get to shoot at kids.

428
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:08,097
那边过去有碰碰车
You got your bumper cars over there down that way.

429
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,037
游乐场在这里
Got your arcade right here.

430
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,014
最新潮的电子游戏全有
All the latest video games.

431
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:13,084
小吃吧在那边儿
Snack bar is over there.

432
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:16,011
可以卖啤酒给家长
Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents.

433
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:17,098
是笔全新的收入
That's a whole new revenue stream.

434
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:19,051
行了行了
All right, enough.

435
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:21,018
我们安全了
We're good.

436
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:24,015
我的老天爷
Holy Christ.

437
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:25,062
安全了
We're good?

438
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:27,052
你觉得这种情况叫安全吗
This constitutes good where you're from?

439
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,039
我的车被人窃听
My car is bugged.

440
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:30,062
我只是说有可能被窃听
I said maybe-- maybe--

441
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:31,096
还被人跟踪
I'm being followed.

442
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:34,006
你他妈这次让我淌的是什么浑水
What the hell have you gotten me into?

443
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:35,043
我自己的私人侦探
My very own P.I.

444
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:36,066
跑来威胁  要打断我的腿
is threatening to break my legs.

445
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,053
就好像玛格侬威胁
That's like Thomas Magnum threatening

446
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:41,027
那个神经兮兮的小胡子[美剧私家侦探玛格侬]
that little prissy guy with the mustache.

447
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,047
太过分了
Over and above.

448
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,077
这早超过了我能给你提供的服务范围
Service-wise, is is over and above.

449
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:46,071
要是你我能躲过这一劫
You and I survive this,

450
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:48,094
我真要重新考虑加钱了
oh, I'm seriously rethinking my pricing.

451
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:50,058
没错  还有你
Yeah. And that goes

452
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,095
你要双倍  嬉皮小子
double for you, Hip-Hop.

453
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:55,005
那家伙不是傻子
My guy's no dummy. Right?

454
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:57,032
我们只有24小时
So I give us maybe 24 hours

455
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,052
赶在他发现地址是假的之前
before he figures out that address goes nowhere.

456
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:02,022
你们做好你们的事  赶紧的
You guys do your thing. Make it snappy.

457
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:05,033
我去看看有没有俄罗斯方块可以玩
I'll go see if they have Tetris or something.

458
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:15,044
你怎么样
How are you holding up?

459
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:19,071
你呢
You?

460
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,074
我干回我的老本行了
I got my old job back.

461
00:33:22,078 --> 00:33:25,055
至少在盖尔接手之前  他们不会杀我
At least until they kill me and Gale takes over.

462
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:29,002
盖尔是他们的人  对吧
He's their boy, huh?

463
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:31,038
没错
He's their boy.

464
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,012
你觉得你还剩多少时间
How long you think you've got?

465
00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:37,036
他问了我很多问题
Well, he asks a lot of questions

466
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,099
关于制毒过程的
about the cooking process.

467
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:41,006
我尽量含糊其辞
I try to be as vague as possible,

468
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,053
但那个维克多一直在监视着我
but I got that guy Victor watching me,

469
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:45,020
我说的每句话他都听着
listening to every word I say.

470
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:48,087
也许我还活着的唯一原因
Maybe the only thing that's saving me

471
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,060
是盖尔的过度严谨
is Gale's fastidiousness.

472
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:53,057
一旦他有把握了
Once he feels confident

473
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:56,004
掌握了我全部方法
that he knows my entire method...

474
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:03,062
那我们怎么办
So what do we do?

475
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:09,072
你知道该怎么办
You know what we do.

476
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:20,053
一定还有别的路子
There's got to be some other way.

477
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,071
也许直接自首对你比较好
Maybe it's better for you to just go to the cops.

478
00:34:26,074 --> 00:34:28,037
对吧
All right?

479
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,091
我也不敢相信自己嘴里说出这话
I mean, I can't believe I'm saying that at all,

480
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:34,028
但是为了你家人着想
but for your family?

481
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,082
缉毒局肯定巴不得抓到你这样的人
The DEA would love you.

482
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:38,052
还有你可以透露给他们多少黑幕
All the shit you could tell them?

483
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:41,055
联邦证人保护  是很好的选择
Federal Witness Protection, that's a good deal.

484
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,076
至于我  我会自己跑路
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.

485
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:45,099
我能逃得掉
I mean-- I'll make it.

486
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,063
我们的确风光过
We had a-- We had a good run.

487
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,070
但已经结束了
But it's over.

488
00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:59,011
绝不找缉毒局
Never the DEA.

489
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:03,098
制毒不能停止
The cook can't stop.

490
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,091
这一点我确定无疑
That's the one thing I'm certain of.

491
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:08,071
货不能断
Production cannot stop.

492
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:10,018
古斯可担不起断货
Gus can't afford to.

493
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:16,019
所以假如我是他唯一的制毒师
So if I'm the only chemist that he's got,

494
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:18,029
那我就有了筹码
then I've got leverage.

495
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,096
能让我活命
And leverage keeps me alive.

496
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,026
也能让你活命  这点还是能保证的
It keeps you alive, too. I think I can see to that.

497
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:27,050
如果我是他唯一的制毒师
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.

498
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:41,011
我下不了手  怀特老师
I-- I can't do it, Mr. White.

499
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:46,075
就像你说的  我...
Like you said, I'm--

500
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,019
我不是个...
I'm not a...

501
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:51,062
我下不了手
I can't do it.

502
00:35:58,037 --> 00:35:59,043
那我来
I'll do it.

503
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:04,014
我需要
I'm gonna--

504
00:36:04,017 --> 00:36:06,041
我需要你的帮助
I'm gonna need your help.

505
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:07,047
他们日日夜夜都
I mean, they're watching me

506
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,091
在监视我
day and night.

507
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:11,034
我根本没机会和盖尔独处
They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment.

508
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,085
而且  我甚至都不知道他住哪儿
Hell, I don't even know where the man lives.

509
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:16,068
黄页上找不到他
He's not in the phone book.

510
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:18,002
在网上也查不着
I can't find him on the Internet.

511
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:20,029
我不能在实验室动手
I can't do it in the lab.

512
00:36:20,032 --> 00:36:21,082
维克多一直在那儿
Victor's always there.

513
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:27,009
但如果能够给我哪怕一个小时
But if I could just...

514
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:29,086
摆脱掉维克多
shake Victor for even an hour one night,

515
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,090
我想那么
I think then that...

516
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:35,023
也许我就能
I may be able to...

517
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,091
把这件事弄成一场意外
make it look like an accident.

518
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,051
一定还有别的办法的
There's got to be some other way.

519
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:48,082
我洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

520
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:52,079
但事情到了你我与他  只能存活一方的境地
But when it comes down to you and me versus him--

521
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:54,035
我只能说抱歉了
I'm sorry,

522
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,026
真的很抱歉
I'm truly sorry--

523
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,046
死的必须是他
but it's gonna be him.

524
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:05,050
你是我唯一的优势
You are the only edge that I've got,

525
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:08,000
他们还不知道你在城里
as long as they don't know that you're in town.

526
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:09,090
我需要你跟踪他
But I need you to track him.

527
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,090
给我他的地址
Get me his address,

528
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:13,051
其他的我来做
and I'll do the rest.

529
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:23,085
听着  杰西  我救过你的命
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

530
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:30,086
你这次能救我吗
Are you gonna save mine?

531
00:38:45,081 --> 00:38:47,071
告诉我  你找到他了
Please tell me you found him.

532
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:52,032
胡安塔波林荫大道  6353号  6号公寓
6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard, Apartment 6.

533
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:57,049
还在听吗
You there?

534
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:59,066
恩  是的
Uh, yeah.

535
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:02,079
胡安塔波林荫大道  6353号  6号公寓  知道了
6353 Juan Tabo, Number 6. Got it.

536
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:07,097
他在家吗
He's home?

537
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,037
在
Yep.

538
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,030
那地方有人监视吗
Anyone watching the place?

539
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:16,017
貌似没人监视
No. Looks pretty much wide open.

540
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,018
你打算什么时候行动
When are you gonna do it?

541
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:24,042
今晚
Tonight.

542
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:26,002
等天黑
Once it gets dark.

543
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:33,012
怀特老师  别这么做
Don't do this, Mr. White.

544
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:35,016
求你了
Please.

545
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:36,069
去自首吧
Go to the cops.

546
00:40:09,026 --> 00:40:10,046
出事了
We got a problem.

547
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,036
实验室里有些化学物品泄漏了
Some kind of chemical leaking in your lab.

548
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,023
你得跟我走一趟
You gotta come with me.

549
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:20,061
我  我开车跟着你
I'll, uh-- I'll follow you.

550
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:22,047
他们让我带你去  我就得带你去
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.

551
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,011
来吧  上车吧
Come on, get in the car.

552
00:41:31,011 --> 00:41:33,011
我不太懂  也许是某个桶漏了
I don't know if it's a barrel leak or what,

553
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:35,061
但下面真的很臭
but you got something mighty stinky down there.

554
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:42,022
你先请
After you.

555
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:47,006
沃尔特  你越快找出原因
Walter, the sooner you figure out what this is,

556
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:48,086
我们就都能早点回家
the sooner we all go home.

557
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,053
求你别这样
Please don't do this.

558
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,037
迈克
Mike...

559
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,041
你不必这样做的
you don't have to do this.

560
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:05,084
不幸的是  我必须得这么做  沃尔特
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do, Walter.

561
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:07,068
请下楼
Downstairs.

562
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:10,008
我会免费制毒
I'll cook-- I'll cook for free.

563
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:11,045
不会再有任何麻烦了
And there won't be any more trouble.

564
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:12,048
-我向你保证  -不行
- I promise you. - No.

565
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:14,035
-好吗  让我和古斯谈谈  -不行
- Okay, if I could just talk to Gus, - No.

566
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,072
-我相信他会明白的  -不行
- I know I can make him understand. - No.

567
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,029
-如果我能和古斯谈谈  -不行沃尔特
-If I can talk to Gus-- No. Walter?

568
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:18,059
我能说服他的
