7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,066
你
You are..

8
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,003
有货吗
You selling?

9
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:31,084
我不懂你什么意思
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,020
好  那就算了
OK. That's cool.

11
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:40,023
我的意思是  如果你有货
I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling,

12
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,044
我想来点儿试试
I could maybe do with a teenth.

13
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:48,036
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding, right?

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,044
伙计  我已经闻到条子的味道了
Dude, I so smell bacon.

15
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:54,039
什么  你在说什么
What? What are you talking about?

16
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:55,086
我不知道为什么
Gee, I don't know.

17
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:58,046
那边  那辆棕色货车
How about over there. That brown van.

18
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:02,091
-那是你的  对吧  -什么棕色货车
- That's yours, right? - What brown van?

19
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,077
停得那么隐蔽
Parked all inconspicuous.

20
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,069
肯定是警车
It's a cop van.

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,091
那里居然还有一辆
Another one right over there.

22
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:15,010
"杜克城市鲜花店"  别装了
"Duke city flowers"? Come on!

23
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,000
就不能有点创意吗
Can't you at least be original?

24
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:20,024
伙计  我真的只想买点货
Dude, I just want to get high.

25
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:21,066
一辆鲜花货车
A flower van.

26
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,061
知道吗  你们应该开辆垃圾车
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,090
说真的  不是想要冒犯你
Seriously. And I don't mean to disrespect.

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,055
但是如果你真的藏了一堆条子
But if you put a bunch of cops

29
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,097
在垃圾车后面
In the back of a garbage truck

30
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,007
我就不可能真的以为
There's no way I'm seriously thinking

31
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,078
垃圾车后面会有条子跳出来
That there's cops in the back of a garbage truck.

32
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,084
只是建议  唷  你们可以考虑一下
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

33
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:41,010
考虑一下  孩子们
Think about it, boys!

34
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:45,036
好吧  我找错人了
All right. I'm hitting it.

35
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:48,055
你们这些人会这么容易放弃吗
You dudes give up that easy?

36
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:49,095
我不是条子
I'm not a cop.

37
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,070
那就把衣服撩起来
Then lift your shirt.

38
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,032
让我看看有没有带窃听器
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

39
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:58,018
好吧  知道吗
All right, you know what?

40
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,063
为了证明你就是个混蛋
Just to show you you're being an asshole.

41
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:03,036
我被白光刺得睁不开眼了
I'm blinded by white.

42
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:04,097
王八蛋
Douchebag.

43
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:07,025
别这样  只是开玩笑  回来吧
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

44
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,010
别生气  坐下  来吧
Don't walk away angry. Sit down. Come on.

45
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:14,045
你在抱怨什么
I mean, what are you complaing about?

46
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,099
你还算有点腹肌
You got abs, man. Kinda.

47
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,024
随你怎么说
Whatever, dude.

48
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,021
我不太想买了
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.

49
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:23,050
你已经把我的瘾都搞没了
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.

50
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,044
伙计  别这样
Come on. Don't be like that.

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,040
我只是要先证明
I just need you to prove it, you know?

52
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:30,087
证明你不是条子
Prove you're not a cop.

53
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:33,039
要怎么做你才相信
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

54
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:35,091
我也不知道
I don't know.

55
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,079
有了
I got it.

56
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:41,041
到那里  给那家伙脸上来一拳
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.

57
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:42,058
哪个
Which dude?

58
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,038
那个吗
That dude?

59
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:46,076
没门  他会把我揍扁的
No way. He'd kick my ass.

60
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,002
那倒是真的
True that.

61
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,079
太难了
This is so hard, you know?

62
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:58,015
我知道了
I know.

63
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,017
很容易
It's simple.

64
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,005
如果你问一个条子他是不是条子
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,

65
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,048
他有责任告知你身份
He's, like, obligated to tell you.

66
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,035
宪法里那么规定的
It's in the constitution.

67
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:09,046
美国宪法吗
Constitution of America?

68
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,060
来吧  你问吧
So go ahead and ask.

69
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,028
你是条子吗
Are you a cop?

70
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:19,039
不是这样的  应该正式一定
Not like that. ask it, like, official.

71
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,072
你是一位警官吗
Are you a police officer?

72
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:25,072
不 我不是一位警官
No.I am not a police officer.

73
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,085
那好吧  一口175
Okay, then. 175 for a teenth.

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,065
谢绝还价  唷
The price is the price, yo.

75
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:38,041
好吧
All right.

76
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,039
给  好好享受
There you go. Enjoy.

77
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,039
谢了  伙计
Thanks, man.

78
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:19,019

80
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:23,032
趴到地上
On your stomach, get on the ground!

81
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,010
不许动
Hold it, don't move!

待好别动
Stay down!

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,020
绝

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,020
命

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,020
毒

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,020
师

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,020
第二季

第八集

89
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:50,057
我原本有份好工作
I had a good job

90
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:53,005
直到老板指控我偷东西开始
until my boss accused me of stealing.

91
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,097
快打电话给索尔
I'd better call Saul!

92
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:03,017
我刚从聚会回来  担心生意的事
I was out partying, minding my own business...

93
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:06,043
你被捕了
You are under arrest.

94
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:08,034
快打电话给索尔
I'd better call Saul!

95
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:12,061
我是索尔·古德曼  你知道自己拥有的权利吗
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights?

96
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:15,012
宪法规定你有  我也说你有
The constitution says you do. And so do I.

97
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,045
除非你被定罪  在此之前我都相信
I believe that until proven guilty,

98
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:20,063
这个国家的男女老少都是清白的
Every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent.

99
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,080
这就是我为你而战的原因  阿尔布开克
And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque!

100
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:24,031
快打电话给索尔
Better call Saul.

101
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:26,044
索尔·古德曼  律师

102
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,069
我真的该买点家具了
I really need to get some furniture.

103
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:38,051
建议你从床开始
I suggest you start with a bed.

104
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:43,062
天啊  真想在这里抽一口
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,035
-你不能  -我知道  我知道
- Well, you can't. - I know. I know.

106
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,072
只是说说
I'm just saying.

107
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:53,094
别以为我闻不出这里有大麻的味道
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

108
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,007
你最好祈祷味道快点散掉
You better seriously hope that airs out.

109
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,069
我爸会扣你的押金的
My dad will keep your security deposit.

110
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:02,084
他的鼻子就像寻血猎犬一样灵敏
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.

111
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,033
是吗
Yeah?

112
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,049
你被他抓住过吗
Has he ever caught you?

113
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,044
有啊
Yeah！

114
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,034
很多次
Many times.

115
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,079
听着
Well, listen.

116
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:20,083
既然我已经损失了所有的押金
Since I already lost my deposit and all,

117
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,032
或许我们该点上一口
Maybe we should light up.

118
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,088
不了  谢谢
No, thanks.

119
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,082
你肯定吗
You sure?

120
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:34,074
我抽一口行吗
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

121
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,009
你可能会改变主意
Maybe you'll change your mind.

122
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,055
随便你吧
Do what you want to do, I guess.

123
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,029
-是我说了什么吗  -没有
- What'd I say? - Nothing.

124
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,095
只是我得走了
I just have to go is all.

125
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:18,005
这是什么
What's this?

126
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,018
18个月的纪念章
My 18-month chip.

127
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:25,067
我正在戒毒
I'm in recovery. And you know,

128
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:27,093
大麻就好像是
Pot is, like,

129
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:30,030
踏脚石
Stepping stones.

130
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,077
戒毒
Recovery?

131
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,051
真厉害
That's cool.

132
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,006
绝对正确的选择
Right on.

133
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,059
很佩服
I respect that.

134
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:44,009
我也抽得不多
You know, I don't really burn much anymore.

135
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:46,082
只是有时来一根
It's just a sometime thing.

136
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:51,004
不过以后  再不会在这房子里了
But no more, like, in the house.

137
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:58,034
想出去吃点东西吗
So, you want to go grab some dinner?

138
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,066
我们可以去吃点中餐
I could really go for some chinese.

139
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,026
我真的要走了
I better hit it.

140
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:07,024
我们还好吧
We cool?

141
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:12,080
顺便说一句  你的卫星电视还开着
Your satellite's on, by the way.

142
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,002
屏幕看起来还真爽
That screen's bad-ass.

143
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,096
我只是觉得这有点过了
I just think it's asking a lot.

144
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,031
他知道情况
He knows it.

145
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,095
他只想表达歉意
He's done nothing but apologize.

146
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:42,081
以后每个周末都要去吗
Is this going to be every weekend now?

147
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:45,088
只到这个季度末  你知道的
It's just the end of the quarter. You remember how that was.

148
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,038
我赚的可是双倍薪酬
But I am earning double time.

149
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,048
看在钱的份上
There's a bright side.

150
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:53,017
等世上最懒的孩子醒了以后
So, when the laziest boy in the world wakes up,

151
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,047
让他把运动鞋洗了  代我跟他说再见
Tell him he better wash those sneakers. And I said "bye."

152
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:59,025
顺便告诉他这次要把鞋晾干
And tell him to let them air dry this time.

153
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,039
我可不喜欢鞋子在我的烘干机里
I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer.

154
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,064
怎么了
What?

155
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:07,052
星期六也要穿得那么正式吗
What, you don't even get casual Saturday?

156
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,058
你看起来真美
You look nice is all.

157
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,028
这是工作  大家都这么穿
It's work. Everybody's gonna be there.

158
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:17,059
好吧
OK

159
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:20,006
今晚买个披萨吃怎么样
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

160
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:23,060
再见-再见
Bye-Bye

161
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:38,092
你好  这里是沃尔特  斯凯勒和小沃特的家
Hi. You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior.

162
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:41,073
有事请留言  我们会与你联系
Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you.

163
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,051
斯凯勒  你在吗
Skyler? Are you there?

164
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:46,037
我真不知道该怎么办
I just don't know what to do.

165
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,031
我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

166
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:50,079
玛丽
Hi, Mary.

167
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,032
是我  发生什么事了
It's me. What's up?

168
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:02,075
昨天我回家的时候  发现他回来了
Yesterday I got home and found him.

169
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:06,015
他都没告诉过我要回来
He didn't even tell me he was coming.

170
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,001
有人被杀了吗  
A man was killed?

171
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:10,015
一个联邦调查局的  就在他眼前
A federale, right in front of him.

172
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,094
三个探员受了伤  有一个没了一条腿
Three agents wounded, one lost his leg.

173
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,026
就好像是在伊拉克一样
It's like what you hear about in Iraq or something.

174
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,093
-那些爆炸装置  -上帝啊
- The IEDs. - Oh, jesus.

175
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:24,002
我从史蒂芬·戈麦斯那里听来的
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.

176
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:27,015
汉克跟他的上级汇报了整整半小时
Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour.

177
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,047
汉克都该拿奥斯卡了  他装得若无其事
Hank should win an oscar. He's so damn breezy with the man.

178
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,048
一挂上电话  又躺到床上去了
He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed.

179
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,079
只是不停地说
And all he keeps saying is,

180
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:38,088
我很好  我没事  让我一个人呆会儿
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,020
宝贝  现在不是时候
Baby, not now.

182
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,098
是我  汉克
It's me, Hank.

183
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:09,050
抱歉
Sorry.

184
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,082
嘿  伙计
Hey, buddy.

185
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:16,097
怎么了
What's up?

186
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,089
我只是
I just...

187
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,026
介意我进来吗
Do you mind if I...

188
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,002
那么
So...

189
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,034
你感觉怎么样
How you doing?

190
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:36,072
不太好
You know. Lousy.

191
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,018
拉肚子  一次又一次
Montezuma's revenge, big time.

192
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,070
所有的东西从我体内通过
I mean, everything's going through me

193
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:45,000
感觉就像屎通过了锡管[指拉得身体没知觉]
Like crap through a tin horn.

194
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:47,033
最好别靠我太近
Better not get too close.

195
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,002
我要冒个险
I'll take my chances.

196
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:02,003
你大概知道华雷斯的事了吧
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juarez?

197
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
太可怕了
Terrible.

198
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,018
还能指望畜生干出些什么
What do you expect? Freaking animals.

199
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,075
像是现代版的电影"启示录"
Like Apocalypse now down there.

200
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:14,093
[译注: 影片《现代启示录》]

201
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:14,093
就像是窝在丛林里的科茨上校
It's like colonel kurtz holed up in his jungle.

202
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,043
而埃尔帕索的指挥官让我回家
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.

203
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:24,051
这可是个英明的领导决策
Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?

204
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:28,011
不让二把手
You don't put your second most senior man

205
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,031
继续追踪那些没娘养的混蛋
on the trail of those motherless bastards,

206
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:31,099
而是让他回家
You send him home.

207
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:36,044
我被告知  "他去取证物袋了"
I was, you know, "He's out getting an evidence bag,

208
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:39,009
"所以毫发无伤"
"and so ends up without a scratch on him.

209
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:42,011
"照片肯定是有问题"
"So must be something wrong with that picture."

210
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,035
所以你回来了不再回去了
So are you home for good?

211
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,065
随机应变吧
Playing it by ear.

212
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:54,090
"待定"
"To be determined."

213
00:12:57,075 --> 00:13:01,038
有没有想过跟谁谈谈这事
Think you might want to talk it through with somebody?

214
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:02,094
跟谁  心理医生
What? A shrink?

215
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,096
我不能  走出这一步
I can't. Start going down that road,

216
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,055
工作就想别要了
Kiss your career goodbye.

217
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:09,058
或者玛丽
Or Marie.

218
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:11,065
或者我
Or me,

219
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:13,097
如果你愿意
If you like.

220
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:23,034
我不知道该怎么说
You know, I don't know how to say this.

221
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,018
我做的事情
You know, the things I deal with,

222
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,010
你我之间不太有
You and me don't have much of a...

223
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,079
用你的话说就是共同感受
What you might call an experiential overlap.

224
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:47,060
如果我说有呢
What if I told you we do?

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,046
我一辈子都过得战战兢兢
I have spent my whole life scared.

226
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:05,007
担心有些事会发生
Frightened of things that could happen,

227
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,095
可能会发生  可能不会发生
Might happen, might not happen.

228
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,095
整整50年我都这么过来
50 years I spent like that.

229
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:16,028
每天3点钟就惊醒
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.

230
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,018
可你知道吗
But you know what?

231
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,046
自从收到诊断书
Ever since my diagnosis...

232
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:29,011
我反而睡得香
I sleep just fine.

233
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,032
然后我意识到
And I came to realize

234
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:43,000
恐惧才是最糟糕的事情
It's that fear that's the worst of it.

235
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,095
恐惧才是真正的敌人
That's the real enemy.

236
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:49,008
所以
So...

237
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:55,076
回到现实世界
Get out in the real world.

238
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,042
狠狠地揍那个杂种
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can

239
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:00,099
打他个满地找牙
Right in the teeth.

240
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,060
再数一遍
Do it again.

241
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:18,078
快点
Go on.

242
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:29,097
一万整  跟上次一样  一分不少
$10,000 even. Same as last time. It's totally accurate.

243
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,040
我和你  会把这机器填满
You and I, we are gonna feed this machine.

244
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:34,022
让它24小时转个不停
I want it running 24 hours a day.

245
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,034
说的是
Right on.

246
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:44,084
不是你的吧  我可收下了
Not yours, I take it.

247
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,021
我们分分  一万
We got 10,

248
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,028
两万
20,

249
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,074
三万
30,

250
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,038
每人四万五
44.5 each.

251
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,024
三磅应该是每人四万八
3 pounds should be 48 each.

252
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:04,033
少了谁的
Who's short?

253
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:07,025
别急  没人少给钱
Don't freak. We didn't get ripped off.

254
00:16:07,038 --> 00:16:09,044
猴子的钱还没交齐
Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.

255
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:11,099
我听说他准备熬通宵
I know he's planning on pulling an all-nighter,

256
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:15,051
-这会儿八成还睡着呢  -那就叫他起来
- So he's probably still in the sack. - Then wake him up.

257
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:17,082
叫他给了钱再去睡
He can sleep after we're paid.

258
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:20,023
你搞这么猴急干啥
Why you gotta be such a hard on?

259
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,083
你不是他兄弟  你是他老板
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

260
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,042
得让他们怕你  才能赚大钱  记得吗
This only works when they're scared of you. Remember?

261
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,079
见鬼
Jack off.

262
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,045
直接连到语音信箱了
It's going straight to voicemail.

263
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,020
语音信箱
Voicemail?

264
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,019
冷静点儿  好吧  数你的钱
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

265
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,002
康宝
Combo,

266
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:49,005
看见猴子没有
You seen badger?

267
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,051
别帮他打马虎眼
Yo. Don't you cover for him!

268
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:54,066
我问你问题
I ask you a straight-up question,

269
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:56,049
你就给我直接答
I expect a straight-up anwser.

270
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,073
怎么
Well?

271
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,035
他们不敢告诉我
They were too scared to tell me.

272
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,035
猴子被抓了
Badger got busted.

273
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:24,028
他在监狱里
He's in jail.

274
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,046
宝贝儿  我回来啦
Honey, I'm home!

275
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,018
太慢啦  过得怎么样
Too slow! What's up?

276
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,031
你的命比该死的猫还多[猫有九条命]
You've got more lives than a damn cat.

277
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:11,061
现在我就差学会自己舔毛啦
Now if I can only learn to lick myself.

278
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,043
过得怎么样  伙计们  见到你真好
What's up, guys? Good to see you.

279
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,072
好啦
All right!

280
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:19,075
回去工作吧  看在上帝份上
Let's all go back to work, for christ's sake!

281
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,037
来我办公室  老弟  让我看看
In my office, man. Let's see what

282
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,086
你们这帮怪物最近在鼓捣啥
You bozos have been up to lately.

283
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,062
你还好吧
You okay?

284
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:48,092
挺过来了
Hanging in?

285
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:51,014
你看呢
What's it look like?

286
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:53,053
警局送来的这是什么东西
What's this from APD?

287
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,079
我跟他们联系过  问他们
I been checking with them to see if they

288
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,060
见没见过那位大名鼎鼎的蓝冰毒贩
come across that famous blue meth of yours.

289
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:59,055
碰巧的是  昨天晚上
Sure enough, last night.

290
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,087
他们抓了个货真价实的毒贩子
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.

291
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,099
我正想开车过去打个招呼
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.

292
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,030
也许你想一起去
Maybe you'd like to go with me.

293
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,078
好啊
Well, all right.

294
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,069
你当面告诉我说你不是警察的  伙计
You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man.

295
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,043
我觉得被利用了
I feel manipulated.

296
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,061
我以为我们能一起出去玩
I thought we were gonna hang out.

297
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,030
我们正一起玩呢  猴子
We are hanging out, badger.

298
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:23,027
你喜欢我叫你猴子还是布兰登
You like Badger or Brandon?

299
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:28,062
我喜欢  那些  不滥用宪法的人
I like people who don't, like, abuse the constitution.

300
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,026
猴子  听我说
Badger, listen.

301
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:34,093
兄弟  我这是在帮你
I'm trying to help you here, man.

302
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,095
只要你告诉我谁给你供货
If you just tell me who your supplier is,

303
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:42,058
我想你就没什么大事了
I think this can end very well for you.

304
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:47,012
怎么我不在场就跟我的当事人谈话
What are you doing talking to my client without me present?

305
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:48,045
鬼鬼祟祟的小贱货
You sneaky pete!

306
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:51,021
什么跟什么呀
Which is which?

307
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:53,097
怎么  你从娘胎里出来就被警局雇了
What, did the academy hire you right out of the womb?

308
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,097
你们这帮家伙越来越年轻了
You guys get younger every...

309
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,025
你跟娃娃脸说了什么  有没有说傻话
What'd you say to baby-face? Did you say anything stupid?

310
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:01,078
我说的"傻话"  是指说任何话
By anything stupid, I mean anything at all.

311
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:04,057
你看你  张着个嘴  像个吱哩哇啦的伴唱
Look at you. Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

312
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,095
我们待会儿再说  现在  你出去
We'll talk about it later. Right now, You out.

There are laws, detective.

315
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:12,058
你幼儿园老师肯定给你念过吧

去喝包果汁  睡个午觉  去吧
Go grab a juice box. Have a nap. Go on.

317
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,001

All right.

318
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:23,047
你是哪位
Who do we have?

319
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,084
布兰登·梅休
Brandon Mayhew.

320

321
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:28,082

00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:37,000
我们开始  公共场所手淫
Here we go. Public masturbation.

324
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,004
-什么  -我不明白  你干嘛那样
- What? - I don't get it. What's the kick?

325
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,046
干嘛不在家干  就跟我们其他人那样
Why don't you do it at home, like the rest of us

326
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:44,092
对着纯平电视  看着50个台的收费节目
With a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?

327
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:47,025
在星巴克  真不错
In a starbucks. That's nice.

328

那不是我啊  老兄
That ain't me, man!

329
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:52,063
我是  我是那个卖冰毒的
I was... I was the guy who was selling meth.

330
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:54,006
据称是
Allegedly.

331
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:58,002
好了  明白了  冰毒  对对
All right. I got you. Meth. Right.

332
00:20:58,014 --> 00:21:00,022
抱歉  对错号了
Sorry, that was a little transpositional error.

333
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:03,000
不是什么大问题
Nothing a little wite-out can't take care of.

334
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:05,061
够判重罪的量
And a felony quantity.

335
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:08,036
-刚超过  -是啊  刚超过
- Just barely. - Yeah, just barely.

336
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:10,032
这的警察都跟卖肉的屠夫一样
The cops around here are like butchers,

337
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:11,095
都会用指头碰秤杆
Always got their thumbs the scales.

338
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:14,043
不过庭上争这个就看运气了
But good luck arguing that in court.

339
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,062
我们说正事吧
Let me get down to brass tacks.

340
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:18,075
我会给你一个打电话的机会
I'm going to get you a second phone call.

341
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:21,000
你可以打给你妈妈或者爸爸
You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy

342
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,051
或者你的教区牧师  童子军队长
Or your parish priest or your boy scout leader,

343
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:27,015
让他们给我张四千六百五十块的支票
And they're going to deliver me a check for $4,650.

344
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,059
我会把数字写在名片后面
I'll write that down on the back of my business card.

345
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:32,033
四  六  五  零
4-6-5-0.

346
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:34,051
我要现金支票
And I need that in a cashier's check

347
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,077
汇票也行  都不要紧
Or a money order, doesn't matter.

348
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:39,046
事实上  我想要汇票
Actually, I want it in a money order.

349
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,043
收款写冰站斑马联盟
And make it out to ice station zebra associates.

350
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:45,001
那是我的户头  完全合法
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

351
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,015
只是为了避税的缘故
It's done just for tax purposes.

352
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:50,053
之后我们可以讨论用维萨还是万事达
After that, we can discuss Visa or Mastercard,

353
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:53,088
美国运通绝对不行  你也别问了
But definitely not American express, so don't even ask.

354
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:55,024
还有问题吗
Any questions?

355
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,016
你会帮我脱罪的  是吧
You're gonna get me off, right?

356
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,069
怎么  我看起来很像你高中女朋友吗
What, do I look like your high school girlfriend?

357
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:05,017
摸上几下就等不及了
Five fingers no waiting?

358
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,044
我说笑话呢  布兰登
That's a joke, Brandon.

359
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:08,061
笑一笑
Lighten up.

360
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:12,047
孩子  我向你保证
Son, I promise you this.

361
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:15,072
我会给你钱能买到的
I will give you the best criminal

362
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:17,051
最好的刑事辩护
defense that money can buy?

363
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:21,083
弗朗西斯卡  我已经搞定了
Francesca, I took these already.

364
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,051
我不是都搞定了吗
Didn't I take these already?

365
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:25,067
听着  那是你的问题
Look, it's on your head. You're not

366
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,030
你不应该吃双倍的维他命A
supposed to double Vitamin A,

367
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,008
对肝脏不好
It's bad for the liver.

368
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:32,015
好了  下一个是谁
Okay, who's next?

369
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:35,006
见过了  我见过他了
Did him. I did him.

370
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,097
他选了公共辩护律师  谢谢你了
That one went public defender. Thanks for nothing.

371
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,064
我那个手淫的小朋友呢
What happened to my masturbator friend

372
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,004
你搞得我晕头转向的
You get me turn around

373
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,072
别挂电话  我待会儿跟你说
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

374
00:22:44,053 --> 00:22:47,001
先生们  我察觉到你们在谈论我的代理人
Gentlemen, I sense you're discussing my client.

375
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:48,021
有什么能跟我分享的吗
Anything you care to share with me?

376
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:50,092
当然  你的那些广告烂透了
Sure. Your commercials? They suck ass.

377
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:54,026
我在抽风的妓院里看的戏都比这好
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.

378
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:56,022
是你妈工作的那家妓院吗
Is that like the one your mom works at?

379
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,084
她还搞买一赠一优惠吗
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?

380
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:00,059
禁毒署哈
DEA, huh?

381
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,023
当街抓人
For a street bust.

382
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:05,064
两家衙门想拿那小讨厌鬼怎么样呢
Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?

383
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,008
这种事早晚都会有的
Sooner or later, this was gonna happen.

384
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:24,036
你想要指数增长
You want your exponential growth,

385
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:26,054
准会有人被抓  就这么简单
Guys are gonna get busted. Simple as that.

386
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,060
我们给他请个真正的律师如何
So how about we get him a real attorney?

387
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,094
我是说  这是什么鬼东西
I mean, what the hell is this?

388
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:31,061
这就是他雇的人
This is who he hires?

389
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:33,068
什么  开什么玩笑
What? Are you kidding me?

390
00:23:34,024 --> 00:23:37,018
这是最佳人选  如果是我就会请他
This is the guy you want. This is the guy I'd hire.

391
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:41,047
-这就是你要请的人  -还记得埃米利奥吗
- It's the guy you'd hire. - Look, you remember Emilio?

392
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:44,051
这家伙把埃米利奥弄出来两次了
This dude got Emilio off, like, twice.

393
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:48,005
每次都差点判死刑了
Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo.

394
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:49,046
却又逃了出来
And then poof!

395
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,015
那家伙像是霍迪尼
Dude's like Houdini.

396
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,015
Houdini: 魔术界逃脱大师

397
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:53,020
说实话  事情变棘手了
Seriously, when the going gets tough,

398
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,034
该找个刑事律师了
You don't want a criminal lawyer.

399
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:58,005
你要找"刑事案"律师
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

400
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,042
懂我的意思吗
Know what I'm saying?

401
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,059
看  我们都没事  怀特先生
Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White.

402
00:24:04,072 --> 00:24:07,002
猴子对我们忠心耿耿
Badger's way too loyal to roll.

403
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:09,020
而且他还很怕我
Plus he's scared shitless of me.

404
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,061
我们出了四千美元  是做生意成本费
We pay four large. Cost of business.

405
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,033
从猴子的工资里扣
Take it out of Badger

406
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:17,007
这是他第一次失手  会差到哪里去呢
And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario?

407
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,026
他们把他保释出来
They plead him out, he does five months

408
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:21,026
他捡了五个月的垃圾
picking up litter ina fellow potato-eate

409
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:24,080
谁在里面接应
So who goes inside?

410
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:27,014
我不想露面
I don't need them seeing my face.

411
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,057
我不想让他们看到我
I don't need them seeing my face.

412
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:33,029
为什么  你一看就是常客
Why not? You look like his typical clientele.

413
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:34,031
扯蛋
Dick.

414
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:36,003
好
Fine.

415
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,077
我们抛硬币
We'll flip for it.

416
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:40,017
选一个
Call it.

417
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,028
人头
Heads.

418
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:58,009
梅休  梅休先生

欢迎光临  请坐
Nice of you to come down. please.

看看
Look at you.

422
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:23,032
我该报警说我找到D.B.库帕了吗
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found D.B.Cooper?

423
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:23,032
D.B.Cooper: 越狱里的人物

424
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:25,011
开玩笑
Joking.

425
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:27,029
过来
Please, come on.

426

428
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,051
你好
Hello.

429
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,094
索尔·古德曼
Saul Goodman.

430
00:25:33,024 --> 00:25:34,029
请坐
Please sit.

431
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:39,047
很抱歉  我们要这么
So it's a shame that we have to

432
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:41,047
偷偷摸摸的见面
Meet under theseme mystery

433
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:49,010
你应该有什么东西要给我吧
I believe you have something for me?

434
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:57,061
梅休  是爱尔兰人还是英国人
Mayhew. Is that irish or english?

435
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,004
爱尔兰人
Irish.

436
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,082
天哪  爱吃土豆的同性恋
Faith and begorrah! A fellow potato-eater.

437
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:04,041
我的真名叫麦吉尔
My real name's Mcgill.

438
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,072
起个犹太名是为了吸引老乡
The jew thing I just do for the homeboys.

439
00:26:07,084 --> 00:26:09,052
可以说  他们只要同乡人
They all want a pipe-hitting

440
00:26:09,052 --> 00:26:11,049
为他们脱罪
member of the tribe, so to speak

441
00:26:11,077 --> 00:26:14,067
我跑题了  有好事发生
I digress. Good things are happening.

442
00:26:14,097 --> 00:26:18,043
你的侄子马上就出来了
Fact is, your nephew's gonna get out in no time.

443
00:26:19,003 --> 00:26:20,038
太好了
That's wonderful.

444
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:23,030
还有些细节问题要解决
There's still a few details to be ironed out,

445
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:25,022
但现在缉毒局牵扯进来了
But now that the DEA is involved,

446
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,090
我看他多半是要判刑或者缓刑
I think he's looking at time served and probation.

447
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,069
把你的电话给弗朗西斯卡  我们稍后联系
So leave your number with francesca, and we'll be in touch.

448
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:34,030
抱歉  缉毒局
Excuse me, the DEA?

449
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:36,079
毒品缉私局
That's the drug enforcement administration.

450
00:26:36,092 --> 00:26:37,092
联邦调查局人员
The feds.

451
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:43,083
我不想说破的
I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news,

452
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:45,091
但你的侄子
But your nephew got mixed up with

453
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:47,057
和一些来路不明的人搅在一起
Some pretty nasty customers

454
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:49,032
我明白
I understand that. But what does

455
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:50,079
但这和缉毒局有什么关系
That have to do with the DEA

456
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:52,067
他们在跟踪一个神秘人物
They're after some mystery man,

457
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,009
叫做海森堡的重量级神秘人物
Some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg.

458
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:57,054
他们迫切想找到此人  就像刀想切肉
They want this guy like the ax wants the turkey.

459
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,009
貌似小布兰登能提供信息
Seems young Brandon may have information

460
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,081
找到海森堡
that could lead Heisenberg...

461
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,057
开心点
Jesus, cheer up!

462
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:04,075
这是好消息
This is good news. I mean,

463
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:07,030
布兰登首先冲进粪堆
Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile

464
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,093
他得沾上点古龙水的味道才能出来
And came up smelling like Paco Rabanne.

465
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:11,036
听着
Look, look.

466
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:15,063
我觉得  我们应该
I just think that we should

467
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,039
看看有什么其他选择
Review our options.

468
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,020
选择
Options?

469
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,057
我来告诉你  你有什么选择
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.

470
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,060
你一共有两个选择
And you got a grand total of two.

471
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:26,063
第一  布兰登老实做事
Option a, Brandon takes the deal.

472
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:29,003
第二  布兰登进监狱
Option b, Brandon goes up to the penitentiary

473
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:31,072
尝尝被人爆菊花的滋味
And gets his rectum resized about yay big.

474
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,018
听着  会不会
Look, look. what about...

475
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,036
遭人报复  如果猴子
Reprisals? I mean, if badger...

476
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:38,096
如果布兰登
If Brandon...

477
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,036
把海森堡供出来
Informs on this Heisenberg...

478
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:45,032
要是  希望不会
I mean, what if... god forbid...

479
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,020
他们会不会
That they decide to...

480
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:49,096
报复
Take revenge?

481
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:52,031
你怎么跟他说的
What have you been telling him?

482
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:54,056
那孩子一直在叫
The kid keeps spouting off about

483
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:56,020
"如果我说了  他们会要了我的命"
"if i talk, thehat's not good

484
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,002
现在他可是这案子的关键
Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal.

485
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:02,023
-很好  -一点都不好
- Good. - No, that's not good.

486
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,007
太恐怖了  相信我  先生
That's terrible. Trust me, sir,

487
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,059
你的侄子在监狱里呆不了两星期的
Your nephew won't last in prison two weeks.

488
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:09,007
你得劝他冒一次险
You let him take his chances on the outside.

489
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:11,054
或许我该申请证人保护
Maybe I can work in some witness protection.

490
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:13,003
不  听我说
No, look, look.

491
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,098
那是一群穷凶极恶的人
These are vicious, desperate people.

492
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:18,043
我听说
I've been told that

493
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:20,056
他们有人杀了人
One of them killed another man

494
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:23,032
用ATM机碾碎了他的脑袋
By crushing his head with an ATM machine.

495
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:28,002
人们总喜欢从ATM机中找点乐子
People love to take credit for the fun ones.

496
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,011
被爆头的那个家伙
The guy who got his head smooshed

497
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:31,056
曾经是我的客户  他说
Used to be a cged," he said.

498
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:34,039
他的妻子杀了他  对吧  这是众所周知的
His wife killed him, all right? It was open and shut.

499
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:37,012
相信我  你们没啥好担心的
Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?

500
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:38,096
我会把你侄子弄出来的
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,

501
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,069
保证安然无恙
Get him singing like a canary...

502
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:42,066
一切都会好的
All's right with the world.

503
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,031
1万美元
$10,000.

504
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,075
1万
10,000.

505
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:03,067
现金付款
Cash to you.

506
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:08,090
我没说让你不管案子
I'm not saying to throw the case.

507
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:13,005
别告诉缉毒局
No talking to the DEA.

508
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:17,064
你说的是我心里想的话吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

509
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:18,064
是的
Yes.

510
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:21,096
会怎么样
What's it going to be?

511
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:26,074
那家伙不肯被收买
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?

512
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,040
那家伙在那里  是我们口中的索尔·古德曼吗
That dude in there? Saul Goodman we're talking about?

513
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:32,022
"引起道德公愤"  他说
"Morally outraged," he said.

514
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:35,090
-威胁我说要报警  -猴子要告密
- Threatened to call the police. - And badger's gonna spill?

515
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:38,004
像埃克森·瓦尔迪兹号邮轮泄油事件一样
Like the Exxon Valdez.

516
00:29:39,094 --> 00:29:41,074
我们该怎么做
So what do we do about it?

517
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:54,064
弗朗西斯卡  我跟着你回家怎么样
Francesca, how about I follow you home?

518
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,067
不用
No.

519
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:57,042
确保你安全
For safety!

520
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:03,092
天哪  你差点要了我的命
God, you are killing me with that booty.

521
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:19,054
别这样  伙计们
Talk to me, guys!

522
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:22,067
别这样  告诉我你们想要怎么样  天哪
Come on. Just tell me what you want! Jesus!

523
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:26,020
不  不  不 ...
Oh, No no...

524
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:29,065
不是我  是伊格纳西奥  是他
It wasn't me! It was Ignacio! He's the one!

525
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,069
闭嘴
Shut up!

526
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:38,093
闭嘴
Shut up!

527
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,011
好吧  说英语
All right, just speak english.

528
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:43,058
不是拉罗派你们来的吗  不是拉罗
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

529
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:46,053
-是谁  -谢天谢地
- Who? - Thank god!

530
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,009
我以为
I thought...

531
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:54,017
先生们  我能为你做些什么
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

532
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,047
任何事  告诉我你需要什么
Anything! Just tell me what you need.

533
00:30:56,074 --> 00:31:00,058
今天下午  我们的同事给你1万美元
This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000.

534
00:31:01,018 --> 00:31:02,079
你应该接受那笔钱的
You should have taken it!

535
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:05,073
等等  这是为了感谢我告诉你们他的名字
Wait a minute. This is in regards to what's-his-name?

536
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:08,040
猴子  布兰登·梅休
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

537
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:11,006
他叔叔  是你们的人
The uncle. That was your guy?

538
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:13,082
无意冒犯  伙计
No offense, guys, but I don't take

539
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,032
我不接受陌生人的行贿
Bribes from strangers, you know?

540
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:17,075
力求稳妥  那是我的座右铭
Better safe than sorry. That's my motto.

541
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:19,082
但你的钱我会收的  我保证
But I'll take your money! Sure!

542
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,096
过期无效
That offer's expired, yo.

543
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:26,007
开价有点低  但还过得去  我接受了
It was kind of low anyways. But okay, okay, I'll take it.

544
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:28,025
告诉我  你想要什么
Just tell me what you need.

545
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:30,076
我好说  我会保持乐观的心态
I'm easy. I'm going to keep a happy thought

546
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,032
并且假定这只是一个谈判策略
And assume this is just a negotiating tactic.

547
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,095
好吧  仔细听我说
All right, listen to me very carefully.

548
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:39,054
你要给猴子·梅休
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best

549
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:41,074
最好的合法辩护
Legal representation ever.

550
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:43,083
别牵扯到缉毒局
But no deals with the DEA!

551
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:48,045
好吗  猴子不会指证任何人的
All right? badger will not identify anyone to anybody.

552
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:50,093
如果他指证  你就死定了
If he does, you're dead!

553
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:54,081
你为什么不杀了猴子
Why don't you just kill badger?

554
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:01,035
听我说  伙计们  如果一只蚊子在你旁边嗡嗡叫
Follow me, guys, but if a mosquito's buzzing around you,

555
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:03,013
咬了你的屁股  
It bites you on the ass, you don't go

556
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:04,073
你不会去找蚊子的律师算账吧
gunning for the mosquito's attorney.

557
00:32:04,086 --> 00:32:07,089
你会去拿苍蝇拍  可以这样比喻
You go grab a flyswatter. I mean, so to speak.

558
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:10,007
冒昧的说
I mean, all due respect, do I

559
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:11,066
这点还需要我为您说明吗
have to spell this out for you?

560
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:14,016
我们不会杀了猴子的
We're not killing badger, yo!

561
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,063
那你真正的麻烦才出现
Then you got real problems.

562
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:17,023
缉毒局会像你对我一样
'Cause the DEA is gonna come down

563
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,098
对你的小弟施以严刑
On your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.

564
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:22,060
我不觉得自己能活着回去
I don't think I'm going out on a limb here,

565
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,055
但他也不会顶罪入狱
but he's not gonna like prison.

566
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:26,038
不管你怎么对我
He's gonna sing like Ceine Dion

567
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:28,065
他会招供的
Regardless of what you do to me.

568
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:35,038
梅休先生
Mr. Mayhew?

569
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:39,083
我记得你的咳嗽
I recognize your cough.

570
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:42,002
脱下面具吧  呼吸点新鲜空气
Take that mask off. Get some air.

571
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,049
继续
Go on.

572
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:55,010
放松点  吸气  呼气
Take it easy! Breathe in, breathe out.

573
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:59,012
我想站起来  行吗  我的膝盖有毛病
I'm gonna stand up, all right? 'Cause I got bad knees.

574
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,059
好些了
That's better.

575
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,042
听着  我们三个人准备把这事搞定
Now listen. The three of us are gonna work this out.

576
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,009
怎么搞
How?

577
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:10,042
首先
First things first, you're gonna put

578
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,021
你们每人在我口袋里放一美元
A dollar in my pocket, both of you.

579
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:16,002
你想要律师委托人保密特权吗
You want attorney-client privilege?

580
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,019
这样才能确保天知地知你知我知
So that everything you say is strictly between us.

581
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:21,045
我是认真的
I mean it!

582
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:24,011
在我口袋里放一美元  拜托  正式一点
Put a dollar in my pocket. Come on, make it official.

583
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,045
快啊  动手
Come on, do it!

584
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:30,082
这就对了  就只是一美元嘛
That's it. Come on. just a dollar.

585
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:37,009
好了  轮到你了  滑雪迷  来吧
All right, now you, ski bum. come on.

586
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:38,076
给一美元吧
Give with the dollar.

587
00:33:39,044 --> 00:33:40,068
-快啊  -放聪明点
- Go on. - Be smart.

588
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:41,062
怎么
What?

589
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,088
-我只有一张5块的  -5块也行啊
- All I got's a 5.  - I'll take a 5!

590
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:49,079
来吧  来吧
Come on, already. come on.

591
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:50,092
这就对了嘛
Be cool.

592
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:56,044
你们现在已经正式
You're now both officially represented

593
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:58,022
授予索尔·古德曼及他的事务所代理
by Sole Goodman and associates.

594
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:01,075
即使砸掉我律师的饭碗  我也绝对保守秘密
Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment.

595
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,071
把那个滑雪面具摘下来吧  我感觉像是
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm

596
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:06,023
在跟地下气象台的人说话一样
talking to a Weather Underground here.

597
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,007
摘下来吧
Do it.

598
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:18,024
所以监狱暴动免谈
So if a prison shanking is completely off the table...

599
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:20,001
这点都同意吧
And we're sure of that?

600
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,058
绝不暴动
No shanking!

601
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,051
好吧  好吧
All right all right.

602
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:29,062
那么在我看来
Then the way I see it is...

603
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,002
总得有人坐牢
Somebody's going to prison.

604
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,080
关键就在于是谁
It's just a matter of who.

605
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,044
好了
All right.

606
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,003
虽然广告上驴劲十足
Lame-ass TV ads aside,

607
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:46,018
当了你的律师  为你编了一套不错的托词
Your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

608
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:48,095
羁押候审  无缓刑  他还挺伶牙俐齿的
Time served, no probation. He's pretty slick.

609
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:51,058
真不敢相信法官就这样同意了
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

610
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,061
先别得意  你还没自由呢
Don't get cocky. You ain't home free yet.

611
00:34:54,074 --> 00:34:56,018
你不交待供货商的名字
You don't give us the name of your

612
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:57,090
就不保证你会得到什么样的宣判了
supplier, I don't know what you'll stand up to, I guess.

613
00:34:57,091 --> 00:35:00,077
探员  没必要鲁莽行事
Agent, the tough guy act is unnecessary.

614
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,069
这位年轻人还是很配合我们工作的
This young man is cooperating fully.

615
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:05,034
是吗  你很配合我们工作吗
Is that right?  You cooperating?

616
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:10,063
好吧
OK

617
00:35:11,044 --> 00:35:13,014
那先从名字开始吧
Let's start with a name.

618
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:16,078
我只知道他叫海森堡
He just goes by Heisenberg.

619
00:35:18,025 --> 00:35:19,012
海森堡
Heisenberg.

620
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:21,075
这位海森堡多大年纪
How old's this Heisenberg?

621
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:23,038
比较老
Old.

622
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:26,022
50或者70左右的样子吧
Like 50 or 70 or something.

623
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:28,087

00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:33,067
光头
No hair.

627
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:35,060
头比你还光
Dude's balder than you.

628
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,000
1963年
1963.

00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,021
詹姆斯·爱德华·柯凯力因偷窃自动贩卖机
James Edward Kilkelly is convicted

630
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:43,005
而被起诉

1987. 1992. You get the idea.

635
00:35:54,058 --> 00:35:56,011
这是他现在的样子
And here he is today.

636
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:58,010
以"来去自如的吉米"著称
Better known today as Jimmy In-'n-out.

637
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,062
在城里  国家以至联邦各种监狱呆过

58年的刑期  他在里面呆了44年
He's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside.

639
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,075
在牢狱里度过一生
An entire life behind bars.

640
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,097
吉米提供一项很特别的服务
Jimmy provides a very special service.

641
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:12,097
给一笔钱  他可以为你进监狱
For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you.

642
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,011
故意
On purpose?

643
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,068
这家伙故意进监狱
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

644
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,079
他在里面觉得更舒服
He's actually more comfortable inside.

645
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:23,010
外面的世界对他来说太残酷了
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.

646
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,041
克林顿执政的时期
Sometime during the Clinton administration,

647
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,056
吉米还想出了怎样

648

靠他的小聪明挣钱

649
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:41,001
-什么时候可以开始  -已经开始了
- When does all this happen? - It's already happening.

650
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,086
交易明天进行
The buy is set for tomorrow.

651
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:45,070
警察搞定吉米  猴子趁机逃走  皆大欢喜
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy,

652
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,091
所有这些要花你八万美元
And all it's gonna cost you is 80,000

653
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:49,083
外加一磅上等冰毒
And one pound of your finest meth.

654
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:58,034
八万块抵他八年的牢狱生涯  是吗
$80,000 for eight years of his life, huh?

655
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,025
首先一点  他不会被判8年的
First of all, he's not gonna do eight years.

656
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:03,058
由我代表他  并且我保证
I'm gonna represent him, and I guarantee

657
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:05,022
在诉讼过程中

658
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,097
会有一些预料不到的问题
Problems with the the prosecution's case.

659
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:09,054
其次  他拿三万  我拿五万
Secondly, he gets 30. 50 goes to me.

660
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:12,075
-你拿五万  凭什么  -凭我协助了你们
- You get 50?  For what?  - For facilitating.

661
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:15,090
谁担的风险更大呢  他喜欢监狱
Who's taking a bigger risk?  He likes prison.

662
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:18,023
你们带了现金对吗
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

663
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,097
听着  要是这个选择太昂贵
Look, if this option is too expensive,

664
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:24,052
你们还可以  猴子在监狱餐厅呢
You can still always... Badger in the chow line.

665
00:37:43,037 --> 00:37:45,041
良心也贵啊  不是吗
Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?

666
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:04,094
好了  目标出现了
All right. There's our boy.

667
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:07,094
很准时
Right on time.

668
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:27,072
-往回走  -什么  好吧
- Go back. - What?  All right.

669
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:42,040
那么
So...

670
00:38:43,006 --> 00:38:45,036
你怎么看  他们发现我们了吗
What do you think? Did they see us?

671
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,029
我觉得我们没事
I think we're good.

672
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,079
猴子看起来想要吐的样子
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.

673
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:58,030
拿给我  快给我
Give me those back. Just give them to me!

674
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,081
见鬼  吉米在哪儿  十分钟之前
Where the hell is jimmy?  He should

675
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,057
他就应该在这儿了
have been here ten minutes ago.

676
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:07,081
你相信吉米这个人是真的么
You think Jimmy's actually for real?

677
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:09,069
一个想进监狱的人
A guy who wants what's to be in prison.

678
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,098
监狱可不止一种含义
There's more than one kind of prison.

679
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,059
那是什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

680
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,073
等等
Wait a minute.

681
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:19,045
不 不 不
No no no...

682
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:21,021
什么什么  让我看看
What? What? Let me see.

683
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:25,003
-那他妈是谁  -不知道
- Who the hell is that?  - I don't know.

684
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,009
我猜  是海森堡先生吧
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

685
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:33,099
该行动了吗
Time to move?

686
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,075
等他们交易
Not till we see the exchange.

687
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:42,060
不 不 不  残了
NO no no  oh shit

688
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:45,056
-怎么  -现在才是他
- What?  - Now he shows.

689
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:51,016
可以开始了吗
Okay, let's do this.

690
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,060
我的天  吉米坐错地方了
My god. Jimmy's on the wrong bench. crap!

691
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,086
我们惨了
We are screwed!

692
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,087
你干什么
What are you doing?

693
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:11,075
搞不懂  怎么磨磨蹭蹭的
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

694
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,080
东西呢  老兄
Where's the stuff, man?

695
00:40:24,013 --> 00:40:26,038
-往哪走啊  -给我闭嘴
- Where are we going? - Just shut up.

696
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:34,072
-下车  拦住他  -缉毒局的人就在那儿呢
- Get out. Go stop him. - The DEA is right there.

697
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:36,015
要是他们发现我  我们就完了
If they see me, we're screwed.

698
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:37,033
下车  我会处理的
Get out. I'll do something!

699
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,020
-什么  -快下车
- What?  - Go!

700
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:54,079
汉克  原来是你啊
Hank, I thought that was you!

701
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,058
施拉德  视线受阻
Schrader, I'm blocked.

702
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:59,054
-我现在很忙  -你近来怎么样  感觉还好吗
- Not a good time. - How you doing? Are you feeling okay?

703
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:01,023
施拉德  视线受阻
Schrader, I'm blocked.

704
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:03,046
我们在工作  你赶紧把车开走
We're working. You gotta get out of here.

705
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:06,090
你们在工作  是缉毒局的那些工作吗
You're working?  like DEA working?

706
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,011
出了什么大事吗
Is something going down?

707
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,086
认错人了  认错人了  在另一个椅子上
Wrong guy! Wrong guy! other bench.

708
00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:22,089
沃尔特 沃尔特 ...
Walt Walt ...

709
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:26,036
-快走开啦  -行行  我这就走
- Move your ass now!  - Okay. I'll go and leave you alone.

710
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:29,081
-等会儿再聊吧  -往前开  往前开
- We'll talk about it later. - Just forward! forward!

711
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:33,017
往前开吗  那我走了
Forward is better?  I'll be out of the way then?

712
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:35,081
抱歉  行了吧  抱歉
I'm sorry. All right?  I'm sorry.

713
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:39,013
-你们忙吧  -待会儿再聊  快走吧
- I'll leave you alone. - We'll talk later. Just go.

714
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:41,095
他去哪儿了  他妈的到哪儿去了
Where'd he go?  Where the hell'd he go?

715
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:45,020
等等
Wait.

716
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:47,030
发现他了
Got him.

717
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,093
-看来有情况  -把他们拿下
- Looks like it's going down. - Take them!

718
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:08,042
不准动  就那  别动
Freeze. Right there. Don't move.

719
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:22,054
天啊
Jesus.

720
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,073
他们好像买账了
I think they bought it.

721
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:31,010
当然了
Absolutely.

722
00:42:31,023 --> 00:42:32,075
顺利逮获  长官
Textbook bust, sir.

723
00:42:33,026 --> 00:42:34,026
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

724
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:37,082
我们截获了一整磅的冰毒
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.

725
00:42:38,017 --> 00:42:40,002
海森堡的真名吗
And Heisenberg's real name?

726
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,082
詹姆斯·柯凯力
James Kilkelly.

727
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:47,051
非常感谢  我的荣幸
Thank you very much. It was my pleasure.

728
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:18,016
你不在家
You weren't home,

729
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:21,003
所以我让搬运队进来了  希望这无大碍
So I let the delivery guys in. I hope that's okay.

730
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,020
当然
Absolutely.

731
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:33,066
你买了张床
So you bought a bed.

732
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,095
什么尺寸  大号的
What is that? A king?

733
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,082
带枕头
Pillow top?

734
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,087
天哪
My god.

735
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:23,043
你还真是化学老师
You really are a chemistry teacher.

736
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:29,043
不介意吧
You mind?

737
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:36,024
我化学学得很烂
I was terrible at chemistry.

738
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:38,087
我更偏向于人文学科
I'm more of a humanities guy.

739
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:41,099
-你怎么找到我的  -我们应该谈谈那件事
- How did you find me?  - We should talk about that.

740
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:46,003
要找到你可不是一般的难啊
It should be much, much harder for people to track you down.

741
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,046
我的私人调查员收了我三个小时的费用
My P.I. charged me for three hours.

742
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:51,021
我很怀疑他有没有用到一个小时
So I seriously doubt it took him more than one.

743
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,080
那么这就是所谓的
So this is what,

744
00:44:56,052 --> 00:44:57,052
要挟吗
Blackmail?

745
00:44:57,093 --> 00:44:59,053
我是你的律师
I'm your lawyer.

746
00:44:59,065 --> 00:45:03,079
你对我说的一切都是保密的
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.

747
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:06,030
我又不是那种搞敲诈勒索的人
I'm not in the shake-down racket.

748
00:45:06,097 --> 00:45:07,061
我是律师  
I'm a lawyer.

749
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:09,081
甚至毒品贩子都是需要律师的  对吗
Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?

750
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:11,096
尤其是毒品贩子
Especially drug dealers.

751
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:15,019
那又怎样  你这样做
So what, you're just doing this out

752
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,061
就是出于你自己的好心
of the kindness of your heart?

753
00:45:17,085 --> 00:45:20,030
拜托  你知道我的每小时工资多少吗
Come on. Have you seen my hourly rate?

754
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:24,008
顺便问下  你把钱放哪儿
By the way, where do you keep the money?

755
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:26,039
是放在床垫里吗  或者是
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a

756
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:28,041
放在果冻盒子里埋在后院吗
jelly jar, buried inside your yard huh?

757
00:45:29,016 --> 00:45:30,098
你的搭档小鬼说不定是
This kid mayhew may be the first

758
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,037
第一个被抓的
of your guys get picked up.

759
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,064
但他不会是最后一个  要是我能找到你
But he won't be the last. And if I can find you,

760
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:36,082
那么离警察盯上你又有多远呢
How far behind can the cops be?

761
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:38,093
我搞不懂
I don't understand.

762
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:41,072
你到底想干什么
What exactly are you offering to do for me?

763
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,096
汤姆·海根对维托·克里昂做了什么  [《教父》角色]
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?

764
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:49,045
我又不是维托·克里昂
I'm no Vito Corleone.

765
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:52,073
别开玩笑了  现在你就是弗利多  [《教父》角色] 
No shit!  Right now, you're Fredo.

766
00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:55,013
但是有合理的建议
But with some sound advice and the

767
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:57,003
和适当的引导  谁会晓得呢
proper introductions who knows?

768
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:59,065
我告诉你一点  你的产品不错
I'll tell you one thing, you've got the right product.

769
00:45:59,078 --> 00:46:02,050
要是被缉毒局盯上了的
Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch...

770
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:04,018
就吃不了兜着走了
You're on to something special.

771
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:08,021
我愿意为此尽点薄力
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.

772
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:12,098
好好考虑下吧
Food for thought, yeah?

773
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:20,013
假如你想多赚些钱
So if you want to make more money

774
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:22,014
并且想把赚来的钱留住
And keep the money that you make...

775
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:25,004
"请致电索尔"
"Better Call Saul!"
