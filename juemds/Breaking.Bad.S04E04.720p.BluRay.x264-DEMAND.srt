1
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,990
你想让我给你开门么
Did you want me to open the doors?

2
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,410
给  给你  钥匙
Here-- Here you go. The keys.

3
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,550
拿着它们  把门打开
You take them. You open the doors,

4
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,210
你为什么说英语
Why you talk English, huh?

5
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,100
不  不  不
No! No, no, no! No!

6
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:03,210
第四季 第四集
S04E04:Bullet Points

7
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,120
赌博毁掉了我的人生
Gambling destroyed my life--

8
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,620
我  我的家庭  我爱的一切
me, my family, everything I loved.

9
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,220
就好像是一次抢劫  唯一不同的是  我就是那个窃贼
It was like a robbery, only I was the thief.

10
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,890
你用来证明它的故事
It's amazing, the stories you tell yourself

11
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,360
很精彩
to justify it--

12
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,320
那个欺骗你不要停手
the lies that lead you to just one more hand,

13
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,760
再转一次
one more spin,

14
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,520
多下一注的谎言
one more roll of the dice.

15
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,590
我们早就说好了
This is our deal, okay?

16
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,820
玛丽  不行
Marie, no.

17
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,760
你们什么都不用干  我是认真的
You guys are not lifting a finger. I mean it.

18
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,320
是的  我们会把吃的都带过去
Yeah, we're bringing everything, so--

19
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,520
别争了好么
This-- This is not up for debate, okay?

20
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,770
很好
Great.

21
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,950
亲爱的  现在别担心了好么
Now, sweetie, don't worry, okay?

22
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,990
我们不会提到账单的
We're not going to say one word about the bills.

23
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,460
我们就为了让大家都方便一些
We just want to bring everyone up to speed, okay?

24
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,220
好的  我们一会见
All right. I'll see you soon.

25
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,260
再见
Bye.

26
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,760
那么
So...

27
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,020
一切就在今晚
tonight's the night.

28
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,640
没有回头路了
No turning back.

29
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,920
好
Well...

30
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,320
好就行
Okay.

31
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,860
我们开始吧
Let's do this.

32
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,790
首先我做好点值分配
Okay, so first I assign point values,

33
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,390
综合几家弃牌的影响
correlate to the effect of removal.

34
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,820
你要分对八么
You going to split the 8s?

35
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,990
斯凯勒  听我说好么
Skyler, please.

36
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,690
现在  根据著名的
Now, the mathematical principle,

37
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,760
凯利标准数学公式
known as the Kelly Criterion,

38
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,880
当然是由我自己改进之后
upon which I devised my own strategy

39
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,820
而不同于麻省理工的公式
not similar to the MIT system.

40
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,860
沃尔特  你不是给他们上课
Walt, you're not teaching them.

41
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,960
你不是想让我做到万无一失么
I thought you wanted me to be thorough.

42
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,490
就玩牌  别说这么多
Just play. You're taking too long.

43
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
什么  你不认为我有必要
What, you don't think it behooves me

44
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,870
把一切都解释清楚么
to be able to explain any of this?

45
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,160
你有必要专业一些  我是这个意思
It behooves you to be a pro, that's all I'm saying.

46
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,260
这都是假的  赶紧
That's the fiction, so chop-chop.

47
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,260
别催我
Don't chop-chop me.

48
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,990
沃尔特
Walt.

49
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,860
现在  我们都知道第一个决定
Now, we both know that the first decision

50
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,580
是对八的时候分牌还是弃牌
is whether or not to split or surrender on 8s.

51
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,930
分牌
Split 'em.

52
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,130
两对都不错
Good on both.

53
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,410
第二个决定是继续要牌还是不要
Next decision is whether to double down or not.

54
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,400
做决定吧
What you should be doing.

55
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,860
11点  好的  要牌
On 11, yes. Double.

56
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,610
这把牌
Okay, this hand over here,

57
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,390
18点
we have a soft 18.

58
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,170
最后的决定  继续要牌还是不要
The final decision is whether or not is to hit or to stand.

59
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,080
发牌
Hit it.

60
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,660
15点
Becomes a hard 15.

61
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,460
庄家有张9
Dealer has a 9.

62
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,360
我看到了
I see that.

63
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,890
发牌
Hit it.

64
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,470
好的  我们来看看我的牌
Okay, let's see what I got.

65
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
21点
And 21.

66
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,320
-该死  -没错
- Damn. - Yep.

67
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,390
好吧  这个
Okay, this--

68
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,720
这个最关键的是
The key thing to remember here

69
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,290
不是一把的输赢
is that it's not about any one hand.

70
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,020
而是每小时玩几把
The key is the number of hands per hour.

71
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
我们再来一次
Let's go again.

72
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,620
零  负一
Zero, minus 1.

73
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,960
好
Okay.

74
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,790
沃尔特
Walt.

75
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,290
我又不是不会玩
It's not as if I don't know how to play.

76
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,720
我对于如何数牌的造诣
I certainly more than understand

77
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,820
还是很深的
how to count cards.

78
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,060
我们还是继续吧  好么
Let's just keep going, okay?

79
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,390
不  你知道么  我在恢复阶段
No, you know what? I'm in recovery.

80
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,420
还记得吧
Remember?

81
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,460
我现在都不应该玩牌
I shouldn't even be playing.

82
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,290
这才是我们应该继续
You-- And that is the fiction

83
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,560
假装的事情
that we should be sticking to.

84
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,860
你知道么
You know what?

85
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,490
你说的对
You're right.

86
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,620
没错
Yeah.

87
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,220
好的
Okay.

88
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,560
我们要把每一步都计划好
Um, we're not leaving anything to chance.

89
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,460
好了  我们开始
All right, let's get started.

90
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,260
我这有很多
I've got a lot of, uh--

91
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,560
沃尔特
Walt,

92
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,020
我们还有很多的细节问题需要解决
we've got a lot of ground to cover.

93
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,720
这是什么
What is this?

94
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,320
我们要把谎编圆
We have to get our stories straight.

95
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,060
我们必须步调一致
We've got to be on the same page.

96
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,120
这是剧本
Is this a script?

97
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,490
要点
Bullet points.

98
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,120
要点
Bullet points?

99
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,760
就和短篇小说一样
Like a novella.

100
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,680
这倒是挺聪明的
This is smart.

101
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,120
你真想编个准备不足  计划不完整
You really want to try to sell a DEA agent some ill-prepared,

102
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,720
漏洞百出的故事来让
half-assed, full-of-holes story

103
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,890
毒品管制局的探员相信我们突然就有钱买洗车场了么
about how we suddenly have enough money to buy a car wash?

104
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,900
我要都记下么
Am I supposed to memorize this?

105
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,460
-我们还要练习  沃尔特  -好
- We need to practice, Walt.  - Yeah.

106
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,870
我们需要字斟句酌
We need to be word-perfect.

107
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,760
还得合情合理
Within reason.

108
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,790
我们需要这个故事值得推敲  能引发同情
We need this story to be solid and sympathetic

109
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,800
最重要的是  能让人相信
and most of all completely believable.

110
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,190
你觉得你告诉玛丽的故事
From a story that you already told Marie

111
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,560
她还没跟汉克说么
and you think that she hasn't told Hank?

112
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,260
别开玩笑了  那可是玛丽啊
Ha! Come on. This is Marie we're talking about here.

113
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,290
不 她没说
No, she hasn't.

114
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,890
她真的没说
She hasn't.

115
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,660
汉克认为一切费用都是他的保险在支付
Hank thinks his insurance is paying for everything.

116
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,090
玛丽没告诉他
Marie's not telling him

117
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
是我们在帮他支付他的理疗账单
that we're paying his therapy bills,

118
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
我们也不会说
and neither are we.

119
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,260
那为什么这样呢
And why is that again?

120
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,590
你是认真的么
Really?

121
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,560
如果我们编出了这个赌博的故事
If we have the gambling story...

122
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,960
你收钱了么  沃尔特
Did you take money, Walt?

123
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,790
你还记得格雷琴和埃利奥特么
You remember Gretchen and Elliot?

124
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,970
因为我记得
Because I seem to recall

125
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,260
你宁肯去贩毒也不接受帮助
that you'd rather sell drugs than take help.

126
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,590
好吧
Fine.

127
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,420
玛丽会单独告诉汉克
Marie will tell Hank in her own time,

128
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,620
而我们要帮她把基础做好
and at least we'll have laid the groundwork.

129
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,460
在汉克和小沃面前坦白交代
And coming clean with Hank and Jun--

130
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,720
很明显  坦白交代
Appearing to come clean

131
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,290
对大家来说都是最好的
will be the best thing for everyone.

132
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,460
我们谈过这个问题了对吧
We talked about this, okay?

133
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,660
我们达成一致了
We agreed about this.

134
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,060
是的  没错  但那只是
Yes, we did. It's just--

135
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,390
什么
What?

136
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,190
算了
Never mind. Just--

137
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,720
好的
Okay.

138
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,220
我认为我们
So I really think

139
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,390
我们得好好演练一下叙述部分
we should tag team the narrative, okay?

140
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,040
一个人负责故事的一部分
We'll each be responsible for certain portions of the story,

141
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,360
这样你我分头叙述的时候
and then we can, uh, we can hand off

142
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,620
就不会出什么纰漏
so we don't leave anything out,

143
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,460
还能表现的自然真实
and it'll seem the most natural.

144
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,190
好了  从我听到
Okay, so I'm going to launch

145
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,060
我们将买下洗车场这个
with the exciting news

146
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,560
惊喜消息开始
that we are buying a car wash--

147
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,960
太好了
Yay.

148
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,970
汉克接下来可能会
The next logical question

149
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,200
问的问题就是
Hank will probably ask

150
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,790
"你从哪弄到的钱"
is "Where are you getting the money?"

151
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,860
我会回答
To which I'll say

152
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,090
"我们从头到尾的讲一讲"
"We want to tell you the whole story.

153
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,290
"很精彩
"It's a doozy,

154
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,490
所以别太惊讶"
so hold on to your hats."

155
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,790
你喜欢么
Do you like that?

156
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,020
当然
Sure.

157
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,070
这样做有两个好处
It accomplishes two things.

158
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,260
很简洁
It keeps it light

159
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,290
而且让他们有所期待
while letting them know to expect something big.

160
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,620
没错  确实很精彩
Yeah. No. It's a doozy.

161
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,560
好了
Okay.

162
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,290
不管怎么说  你从这开始接着我的说
Anyway, that's where you will take over,

163
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,620
从诊断开始  第一页到第二页
starting with your diagnosis, pages 1 and 2.

164
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,490
基本上
Okay, and it's-- it's pretty much

165
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,090
和真相差不多
going to run parallel to the truth,

166
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,990
虽然很简单
which makes it easier,

167
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,080
但是
but, um...

168
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,360
一定要强调癌症的问题
just make sure to really hit the cancer,

169
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,390
突出恐惧感和绝望的心态
really touch on the fear and despair.

170
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,000
提醒他们不要忘记
It's good to remind them

171
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,560
同时博得他们的同情
and to get their sympathy right off the bat.

172
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,570
我们要让他们明白
We want them to understand

173
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,370
你为什么会做这么蠢的事情
why you could do something so stupid.

174
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,560
这个完了之后
Now, after that,

175
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,120
是第三页和第四页
per pages 3 and 4,

176
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,360
在你说完
after you say...

177
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,220
"赌博成瘾
"Gambling became an addiction,

178
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,760
我已经没法控制了"
and I just couldn't control it."

179
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,650
-你看到了么  -看到了
- Do you see that-- - Yes.

180
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,020
就在那页中间  好的
...right there in the middle of the page? Okay.

181
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,960
我还提到了那次抢劫
Oh, and I put in that line about robbery.

182
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,420
就在那次匿名戒毒会上
You know, from the G.A. Meeting?

183
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,490
我觉得那个不错
I thought that was good.

184
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,690
接下来我会插话  谈谈它对我们婚姻的影响
So next I'll chime in about how it affected our marriage,

185
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,260
从困惑开始
uh, starting with the confusion,

186
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,590
欺骗
uh, the deceit,

187
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,960
为什么不告诉别人
why we couldn't tell anyone.

188
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,990
"对我的行为感到非常  非常惭愧"
"...terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions."

189
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,090
没错
Yeah.

190
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,560
俩"非常"
There's two "Terriblys"?

191
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,960
表现你的悔悟之情
It's supposed to show contrition.

192
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,490
可我是不会这么用词的
Well, I just wouldn't use that word.

193
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,220
我从来不说"非常"
I would never say the word "Terribly."

194
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,520
按你想说的来  行了么
Phrase it however you want, okay?

195
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,020
你又开始新话题了  现在
You're jumping ahead. Now--

196
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,690
我为什么感到惭愧
And why-- why am I so ashamed?

197
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,860
你非要我回答么
Do I really need to answer that?

198
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,490
我一直供养我们的家庭   过去是  现在也是
I was and am providing for our family.

199
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,660
我们就从刚才停下的地方继续吧
Let's just pick up where we left off.

200
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,790
我很脆弱  失去控制
I'm weak, and I'm out of control.

201
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,890
我是说  这一切说的我好像是个废物
I mean, this whole thing makes me look like crap.

202
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,260
这个故事必须要毫无保留  沃尔特
This has to be a warts-and-all story, Walt.

203
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,560
我们需要让别人相信的就是这个  你我都难过极了
That's how we'll sell it, and we both look bad.

204
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,990
是这样  那你是怎么难过的
Oh, well-- How do you look bad exactly?

205
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,090
我找找那个"我和我老板睡觉"这条在哪
Where is the "I slept with my boss" Bullet point?

206
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,290
我怎么找不到呢
I can't seem to find that anywhere.

207
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,060
对于一个靠制毒生活的  被解雇了的中学教师
For a fired schoolteacher who cooks crystal meth,

208
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,490
我得说你反映挺快的
I'd say you're coming out pretty much ahead.

209
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,000
我不喜欢这个
I don't like it.

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,940
我不喜欢小沃瞧不起我
I don't want Junior thinking less of me.

211
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,320
至少你赌钱赌赢了
At least you won at gambling.

212
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,720
我却是个贱人妈妈
I'm just the bitch mom

213
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,290
总是对你步步紧逼
who wouldn't cut you any slack.

214
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,560
抱歉
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,120
抱歉把你牵扯进来
I'm sorry that I put you through all of this.

216
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,960
这句怎么样
How's that sound? Hmm?

217
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,430
给我
Here.

218
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,260
两个"抱歉"
Two "Sorrys."

219
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,790
我想我们到第五页了
I believe we were on page 5.

220
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,960
那么  等你说完抱歉之后
So, after you say how very sorry you are--

221
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,420
当然  用自己的方式
in your own words, of course--

222
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,190
我们就快结束
we're almost to the end,

223
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,720
我说我为你能去
and I say how proud I am of you

224
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,620
参加那个十二步的恢复计划而感到骄傲
for joining a 12-step program,

225
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,120
然后这里  我认为我们就要
and-- and this is where I think we should enact

226
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,060
把我们的感觉表演出来
how we're feeling, you know?

227
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,190
只是一个建议
Just a-- Just a suggestion.

228
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,690
你应该懊悔的看着地板
You might look down on the floor with remorse.

229
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,860
怎么了  又不是认真的
What? You don't have to mean it.

230
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,190
你就低头  沃尔特  行么
You just stare down at your feet, Walt, okay?

231
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,590
然后  我就
Then, uh, I'm gonna--

232
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,520
我想的是抓住玛丽的手
I was thinking of taking Marie's hand

233
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,190
说点煽情的话
and saying something emotional

234
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,420
比如"能和你说出来真是太解脱了
like "It's such a relief to tell you.

235
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,050
"有这么强大的家庭
"We're just so glad we have a strong family

236
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,470
来互帮互助  共度难关
"To help us through this,

237
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,060
我们真是太高兴了"
that we can all support each other."

238
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,260
然后我可能会哭一下
And then maybe I'll tear up a little.

239
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,790
我也不知道
I don't know.

240
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,890
等到时候看情况吧
I'll just have to see what happens in the moment.

241
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,520
你会哭出来  就在那个时候
You're going to cry? On cue?

242
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,320
我说我不知道  可能会
I said I don't know. Maybe.

243
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,710
那你抹去眼泪的时候
When you dab your eyes, you going to do it

244
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,090
你打算用左手还是右手
with your right hand or your left?

245
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,350
-这只是个想法  -流一滴还是两滴
- It's just an idea.  - One tear? Two tears?

246
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,520
这个戏一定要做足
This has to be convincing,

247
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,020
特别是要让汉克相信
especially to Hank.

248
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,260
我要尽我可能做到最好  沃尔特
I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.

249
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,120
没错  我就是要做到万无一失
And yes, I'm thorough.

250
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,920
也许撒谎对我来说
Maybe lying doesn't come as easily to me

251
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,420
没有对你来说那么容易
as it does to you.

252
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,190
伙计们  请进
Hey! Guys! Come on in.

253
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,790
你好  见到你很高兴
Hi. Good to see you.

254
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,290
把她放到那  小伙儿
Put her there, you little punk.

255
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,620
很高兴见到你  汉克
Great to see you, Hank.

256
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,720
伙计  最近如何啊
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

257
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,920
快来看看我的小公主啊
Oh, look at my little princess.

258
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,120
越长越大了
She's getting big, huh?

259
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,820
也重了
And heavy, too.

260
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,790
我闻到的是真的食物吧
Whoa, is that actual food I'm smelling?

261
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,790
我也能吃上一顿地道的饭菜了
I might get an honest-to-God meal here for once?

262
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,890
你看上去真不错
You look good.

263
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,060
谢谢你  亲爱的
Thank you, sweetheart.

264
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,360
你的姨妈  玛丽  她长的挺美
Your aunt Marie, she's cute,

265
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,420
就是总是把水烧过了
but she could burn water,

266
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,490
你懂我的意思么
you know what I'm saying?

267
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,560
你还真是搞笑
You are so very hilarious.

268
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,740
带着男人们去看看你的石头收藏吧
Go show the boys your new rock collection.

269
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,040
我们去把东西准备好
We're going to get things organized.

270
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,460
是的  大约需要二十分钟
Yeah, it'll be about 20 minutes.

271
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,600
你还收藏石头
You have a rock collection?

272
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,790
是矿石收藏
It's a mineral collection.

273
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,220
就是一些小玩意
Uh, just a little something I--

274
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,510
你们想看看么  想看么
You guys want to see it? Want to see it?

275
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,380
当然  我们去看看
Sure. Let's go see it.

276
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,360
哦  让我来
Oh, hey, let me.

277
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,480
没事  我能行
Hey, it's all right. I got it.

278
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,460
来吧  伙计们  就在走廊头上
Come on, guys, it's down the hall here.

279
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,630
那边那块  叫蔷薇辉石
Now that one there, that's Rhodonite, okay?

280
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,720
是锰链硅酸盐
It's manganese inosilicate.

281
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,360
真棒
Cool.

282
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,390
为什么是粉色的
What-- What makes it be all pink like that?

283
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,140
那是锰的颜色
Well, that's the manganese part, okay?

284
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,570
氧化了  你知道  就和生锈了一样
It-- It oxidizes, you know, like rust.

285
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,160
没错  锰可以在负三到正七之间保持
Exactly. Manganese can have an oxidation state

286
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,460
氧化状态
of between -3 and +7,

287
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,340
颜色在紫  绿  蓝
which takes it through a range of colors--

288
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,890
的界限内变化
purple, green, blue.

289
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,260
但最稳定的状态是正二
But its most stable state is +2,

290
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,660
一般就是浅粉色
which is usually pale pink.

291
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,220
就是这么回事
So...

292
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,510
没错  他说的那一堆乱七八糟就是对的
Exactly. Whatever the hell he said.

293
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,520
不管怎么说  你明白了就行
Anyway, you, uh, you get the idea.

294
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,960
没错  很有意思
Yeah, it's, uh, interesting.

295
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,920
很有意思的东西
Interesting stuff, that.

296
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,160
真的
Really.

297
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,320
在这  把那个文件递给我
here. Give me that file, will you?

298
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,320
这个你可得看看
You got to check this out.

299
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,210
我一直在研究一些东西
I, uh, have been working on something here.

300
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,590
就提供一点咨询
Been a little, uh, little consulting--

301
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,060
帮阿尔布开克警局办案
you know, weighing in on a case for APD.

302
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,390
把那个放进去
Put that in, will you?

303
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,460
放到那里面去
Put that in over there.

304
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,690
汉克  这里面是什么  不会是尸体什么
Uh, Hank, what is this? It's not a dead body--

305
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,760
不不不  不是那些
No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.

306
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,260
你们  说真的  得看看
You guys-- Seriously, you got to check this out.

307

Look.

311

一艘飞船在等待
A ship is waiting

312
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,280
所有设备都准备完备
All systems are go

313
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,300
确定吗  控制系统不值得信赖
Are you Sure, Control is not convinced

314
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,330
但是电脑说
But the computer has the evidence

315
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,930
没必要放弃
No need to abort

316
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,560
倒计时开始
Countdown starts

317

伙计  这你可编不出来
Oh, man. You can't make this stuff up.

318

4  3  2  1
4, 3, 2, 1

319
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,790
地球在我们脚下
Earth below us

320
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,990
这是谁
Who is this?

321
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,160
这位  我的朋友们
That, my friends,

323
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,320
失重
...weightless

324
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,160
呼叫  呼叫
Calling, calling

325
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,030
能和你们说出来真是太解脱了
Such a relief to finally tell you.

326
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,960
有这么强大的家庭
We're just so glad

327
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,000
来互帮互助  共度难关
that we have a strong family to help us through this,

328
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,160
我们真是太高兴了
that we can all support each other.

329
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,930
我的天呐

330
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,660
我都不知道该怎么说
I don't even know where--

331
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,630
我了个去啊
Holy shit.

332
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,730

沃尔特・H・怀特

一个天赋被埋没的男人
Man of hidden talents.

335
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,660
老爸  你太牛了
Dad, you're such a stud.

336
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,230
你到底赢了多少
How much did you win exactly?

337
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,630
老爸
Dad?

338
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,200
我也没有一个具体的数字
I-- I don't think I have exact figures.

339
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,660
足够来
It's, uh, it's enough to--

340
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,400
当然  去税之后
uh, after taxes, of course--

341
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,060
买下洗车场的了
to buy the car wash.

342
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,560
也许还够
Maybe even pay for

343
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,560
支付两个孩子的大学学费
a couple of halfway reasonable college educations.

344
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,100
该死的  老爸  你为什么不玩了
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?

345
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,500
我现在都能收到汽车作为生日礼物了
I can totally get a car for my birthday now.

346
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,100
对吧
Right?

347
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,000
儿子  我
Son, I'm...

348
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,260
对我的行为感到非常  非常惭愧
terribly, terrible ashamed of my actions.

349
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,960
我能离开下么
Would you excuse me, please?

350

我需要上个厕所
I need to use the restroom.

351
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,660
沃尔特
Walt?

352
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,500
抱歉  我
Oh. Sorry. I--

353
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,160
我还以为你在里面摔倒了
I thought you might have fallen in there.

354
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,460
没有  没有  我只是
Uh, no, no. I just, uh--

355
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,460
那里面可有很重要的东西
Hey, man, that was some big stuff back there.

356
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,130
是的  我们想坦诚一些
Yeah, we wanted to be thorough, so--

357
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,060
是啊  那确实是个好故事
Yeah, well, it's quite a tale.

358
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,530
说出来一定不是那么轻松吧
It couldn't have been easy to talk about.

359
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,860
你知道么  沃尔特  如果你
You know, Walt, if you...

360
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,530
你可以告诉我
you can always bend my ear, right?

361
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,400
我是说  如果你需要倾诉或者
I mean, if you ever need to talk or--

362
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,160
发泄
or just blow off some steam.

363
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,010
我就在这
I'm-- I'm here.

364
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,130
也去不了哪
Not going anywhere.

365
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,260
谢谢你  汉克
Thanks, Hank.

366
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,460
相同的话也送给你
Same goes for me, you know.

367
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,500
如果你有什么想给我发泄的
if you ever want to bounce anything off me.

368
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,900
比如说  案子的事  其他的事
I don't know, case work, anything, really.

369
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,700
有些事情  也许说出来
Sometimes just talking something through,

370
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,730
就有可能理出头绪
you know, really can make a difference.

371
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,830
我是说  我们说的绝对不是
I mean, we're definitely not talking,

372
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,100
那种小打小闹
you know, bathtub crank here.

373
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,500
这是一个大工程
This is a big-ass operation.

374
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,630
一周几百磅
You know, hundreds of pounds a week,

375
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,430
还可能更多
maybe more.

376
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,600
那么
So, uh...

377
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,700
这个人是谁呢  对他你了解多少
who is this person? What do you know about him?

378
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,260
除了他已经死了
Other than the fact that he's deader than a Texas salad bar

379
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,080
还收藏了一套不错的管弦乐器之外
and has a decent set of pipes?

380
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,700
他是我要找的人
I'd say he's my guy.

381
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,000
你要找的人
Your guy?

382
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,360
有个神秘人物
There's this, uh, mystery man

383
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,060
我追踪他
I've been, uh, chasing

384
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,500
将近一年了
for the better part of a year.

385
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,980
他做出的冰毒
Cooks the purest meth

386
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,480
是我和其他人见过最纯净的
that, uh, me or anyone else has ever seen.

387
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,430
名字叫海森伯格
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.

388
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,460
是的  名字很怪对吧
Yeah. Pretty weird, huh?

389
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,800
我  我查了一下
I-- I-- I looked him up.

390
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,610
那是一个物理学家  希特勒的手下
It, uh, it was one of these physicists-- one of Hitler's guys,

391
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,220
一个叫维尔纳・海森伯格的物理学家
a physicist named Werner Heisenberg.

392
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,530
很有意思是吧
Real cute, huh?

393
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,110
不管怎么说  我想到一个办法
Anyway, I figure with a handle like that,

394
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,770
我的人是个有点书呆子的人  无意冒犯
you know, my guy's got to be some sort of an egghead. No offense.

395
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,460
名字叫做
And here we go--

396

397
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,820
我就是想看看
Anyway, I-- I-- I just want to see

398
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,800
从化学角度上来看
if I'm, you know, not barking up the wrong tree

399
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,160
我是不是找对人了
chemically speaking.

400
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,400
就我的理解来看
Uh, as far as I can make out,

401
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,960
他写的是苯丙酮制毒法
he's writing about phenylacetone cook, right?

402
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,660
没错
Yeah.

403
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,760
没错  现在已经很少见了
Yeah. That's pretty rare these days,

404
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,040
但它确实能产出
but it-- it does jive

405
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,800
我一直在追查的蓝色冰毒

素食甜点的食谱
It's a recipe for vegan s'mores.

409
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,030
这上面什么乱七八糟的东西都有
Hmm. There's all kinds of crazy crap in there.

410
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,100
没错  就像

415
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,260
这个家伙
This guy was a, uh--

416

这小子真是有个性啊
man, he was a real character.

417
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,700
是啊  他真的是独特
Yeah, he seems, uh, unique.

给我  我给你  给你看点东西

00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,300
W・W
W.W.

425
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,100
我是说  你觉得这是谁
I mean, who do you figure that is, huh?

426
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,960
伍德罗・威尔逊
Woodrow Wilson?

427
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,030
威利・旺卡
Willy Wonka?

428
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,630
沃尔特・怀特
Walter White?

429
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,800
你抓住我了
You got me.

430
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,330
W・W
W.W.

431
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,140
伙计  让我稍微看一下
Hey, man, let me see this...

432
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,930
我好像想起一点...
for a second because I think I remembered...

433
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,730
在这
Ah. Here.

434
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,900
没错
Yes.

435
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,850
就是这儿
Yeah.

436
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,800
"当我听完博学的宇航员的话
"When I heard the learn'd astronomer..."

437
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,660
每一次向天空望去
Learned. "And from time to time

438
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,430
"感受星星上
"Looked up in perfect silence

439
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,560
完美的平静"
at the stars."

440
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,130
这是沃尔特・怀特曼的诗
It's a poem by Walt Whitman.

441
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,200
你要的W・W
Your W.W.

442
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,730
你真是聪明
You frickin' braniac.

443
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,500
真是太聪明了
Ha. You frickin' braniac.

444
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,000
我一定是上学的时候翘了那节课
I must have skipped that day in school or something.

445
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,760
谁知道呢
I don't know.

446
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,900
我把自己给绕进去了
I've been chasing my tail about that one, you know?

447
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,860
你应该是对的
I bet you're right.

448
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,130
很高兴能帮上忙
Well, I'm glad I could be of help.

449
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,660
对  沃尔特・怀特曼是吧
Yeah. Walt Whitman, huh.

450
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,860
所以你怀疑这个叫盖尔的人
So, uh, you think this Gale person

451
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,300
就是你要找的海森堡
is your Heisenberg?

452
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,660
对  应该是吧  但不肯定
Yeah, I think so. I don't know.

453
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,500
我就想抓住这个人
G--, I wanted to get this guy.

454
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,800
看来你已经得偿所愿了
It looks like you did.

455
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,530
不  我的意思是亲自抓住他
No, I mean, you know, me personally.

456
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,160
我想亲自给他铐上手铐
I wanted to be the one to slap the handcuffs on him,

457
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
铐上那渣子
that kind of shit.

458
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,130
波沛・多伊尔对青蛙一号摇手
Popeye Doyle waving to Frog One.

459
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,390
我没记错的话
If I recall,

460
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,200
至少在第一部《法国贩毒网》里
at least from the first French Connection,

461
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,200
波沛・多伊尔就没真正抓住过他
Popeye Doyle never actually caught him.

462
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,660
我和老波沛差不多
Yeah, I guess me and old Popeye, huh?

463
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,730
总晚了那么一步
A day late and a dollar short.

464
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
那杀他的凶手呢
What about the person who killed him?

465
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,010
那是阿尔布开克警局的事了
APD's problem, not mine.

466
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,630
有线索吗
Any leads?

467
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,890
我兄弟提姆说
My buddy Tim says

468
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,150
他们采到些指纹  准备用来识别身份
he's got some fingerprints they're trying to ID,

469
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,230
还有个目击证人看到个嫌犯
and an eyewitness saw a person of interest.

470
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,530
或许能查到真凶
Might get lucky there.

471
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,600
我觉得有人知情
I guess somebody knows something.

472
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,010
他们最终会找到开枪的人
They'll track down the shooter eventually.

473
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,030
杰西
Jesse!

474
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,760
请借过
Excuse me.

475
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,230
天呐
Oh, my G--.

476
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,260
杰西
Jesse?

477
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,350
什么事
What's up?

478
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,500
我有话和你说  行吗
I need to talk to you, okay?

479
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,860
就现在
Now.

480
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,060
说吧
Go ahead.

481
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,330
你能先停一下吗  拜托了
Would you stop doing what you're doing, please?

482
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,200
等这个剃完了  还有下一个
When I'm done, yo, that dude's next.

483
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,040
搞什么鬼  怎么了
What the hell? What is wrong--

484
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,600
我有公事要谈
I have some business to discuss.

485
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,970
那就谈吧  天呐
So discuss. Jesus.

486
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,760
放开我
Let go of me.

487
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,000
警方正在调查盖尔的凶案
Gale's murder is being investigated.

488
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,930
废话
Uh, duh.

489
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
我得到可靠消息
And I have it on good authority

490
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,600
他们在罪案现场发现了指纹
that they found fingerprints at the scene.

491
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,390
不是我的
Not mine.

492
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,330
说完了吗
We done here?

493
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,730
没  还没完
No, we are not done here.

494
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,400
要是你的怎么办
What if they are yours?

495
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,660
你怎么这么确定
How can you be so sure?

496
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,560
因为我还在这里  没看见吗
Because I'm here, all right?

497
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
你连襟早就盯上我了
Your brother-in-law's got such a hard on for me

498
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,260
如果警察发现了我的指纹
that if the cops would have found my fingerprints--

499
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,990
警察要是在那地方五条街以内
The cops would have found my fingerprints

500
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,430
发现了我的指纹
within five blocks of that place,

501
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
早就把我带走了
they would have picked me up by now.

502
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,360
弹壳呢
What about the casing?

503
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,660
弹壳呢
Or casings? How--

504
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,200
你对他开了几枪
How many times did you shoot him anyway?

505
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,860
杰西  你把弹壳捡起来了吗
Jesse, did you pick up the casings?

506
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,500
捡起来了吗
Did you pick them up?

507
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,700
没
No.

508
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,500
听着  我们得一步步来
Listen, uh, we've got to go over this

509
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,060
重现当时的一切情景
step by step-- everything.

510
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,130
你得告诉我从你到那里开始
I want you to tell me exactly what happened

511
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,530
确切的事发经过
from the moment you got there.

512
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,260
我进去又出来了
I got in, I got out.

513
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,460
不  不  我要知道细节
No. No, I need to know specifics.

514
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,120
现在我们从头说起
Now, we'll start from the beginning.

515
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,530
你开车过去  你开车过去
You-- You drove there. You drove over there.

516
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,300
冲着他家门走去  对吗
You went to his door, right?

517
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,030
杰西  我要你全神贯注
Jesse, I need you to concentrate.

518
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,030
事关重大
This is very important.

519
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,500
你是敲门了还是按门铃了
Did you knock or ring?

520
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,100
敲门还是按门铃
Knock or ring? Uhh!

521
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,600
敲门
Knock.

522
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,760
好  很好  非常好
Okay, good. That's very good.

523
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,500
仔细听好
Now listen.

524
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,730
设想盖尔应了门
I assume that Gale answered the door.

525
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,030
然后呢
Now what happened after that?

526
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,530
他认出你来了吗
Did he recognize you?

527
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,730
你们对话了吗
Did you say anything to each other?

528
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,100
你进门了吗
Did you walk into the room,

529
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,900
还是当场就开枪杀了他
or did you shoot him right then and there?

530
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,930
怎么了
What?

531
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,730
谁想赚一百块
Who wants to make a hundred bucks?

532
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,590
听着  这孩子可能没说错
Look, the kid's probably right.

533
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,660
要是警方有证据
If they had anything on him,

534
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,460
早就把他关起来了
he'd be locked up already.

535
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,300
那我的连襟呢
What about my brother-in-law?

536
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,690
他怀疑杰西
He suspects Jessie。

537
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,960
不知怎么  他就知道杰西
How, he knows Jesse is involved

538
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,000
也参与蓝色冰毒的贩卖了
in the sale of blue meth.

539
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,460
那是汉克唯一的线索
That was Hank's one and only lead.

540
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,000
要是他把这些线索联系起来
Now what if he puts 2 and 2 together

541
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,230
从杰西这条线索查这起凶案呢
and he goes after Jesse for the murder?

542
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,400
怎么查  靠他的杂牌小车吗
He goes after him how, on his Rascal Scooter?

543
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,490
可能有点过
Ahem. That, perhaps, sounded insensitive.

544
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,100
可如果他查他的话
Uh, but if he goes after him,

545
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,660
我就告他治安粗暴
I'll sue his ass for police brutality,

546
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,190
骚扰  攻击  还有其它16项罪名
harassment, assault, and 16 other things.

547
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,390
现在拿两个人的纠葛已经发展到
Now, the history that those two have together

548
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,760
现在这个样子
being what it is,

549
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,200
你得认为你的连襟
you got to figure your brother-in-law's

550
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,100
足够聪明  不从这条线索追查下去
smart enough not to go down that particular road.

551
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,490
零蛋
Goose egg, bupkis--

552
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,100
那帮警察就得到了这个了
that's what the cops got.

553
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,390
我不会操那份心
I wouldn't worry about it.

554
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,930
我还有什么事不用操心的  索尔
What else should I not worry about, Saul, hmm?

555
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,630
我是不是也不用担心古斯一逮到机会
Should I not worry that Gus plans to murder me

556
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,060
就要杀我
at the first chance he gets?

557
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,430
我是不是也不用担心我吸毒成性的搭档
Should I not worry that my drug-addicted partner

558
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,550
无所谓自己的死活
doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies?

559
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,060
你该看看他的房子
You should see his house.

560
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,030
和贫民窟没两样
It's-- It's like Skid Row.

561
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,230
一堆流浪汉住在那里
He has actual hobos living there.

562
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,130
现在离古斯觉得他是个大麻烦
Now how long before Gus decides

563
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,930
还有多远
that he's too big of a risk?

564
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,010
那个麦克
Geez, that Mike,

565
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,420
那个总犯嘀咕有眼无珠的白痴
that grunting dead-eyed cretin

566
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,630
冲我脸上就是一拳
sucker-punching me in the-- in the face.

567
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,080
我看到古斯挥舞着切割机
I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.

568
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,200
我是说  我收到讯号了
I mean, Western Union-- message received.

569
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,860
这...
It--

570
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,560
我问你
Let me ask you.

571
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,260
这什么时候不是桩买卖了
When did this stop being a business, hmm?

572
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,890
为什么只有我
Why am I the only person

573
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,460
可以表现得像个专业人士
capable of behaving in a professional manner?

574
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,930
不  我...
No, I--

575
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,360
不  无论你从哪方面考虑  谁都有危险
No, any way you slice it, everyone's in danger.

576
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,930
我怎么才能保护大家
I mean, how-- how can I protect anyone?

577
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,860
我的亲人  杰西  我自己
My family, Jesse, myself?

578
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,210
我的名字没有就入选  对吗
My name never comes up with those guys, does it?

579
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,930
与此同时  我们还要买这家该死的洗车店
Meanwhile, we're buying this stupid car wash.

580
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,030
对  木已成舟
Oh. Yeah. That ship has sailed.

581
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,000
一路平安
Bon voyage.

582
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,260
我们已经付诸实践了
We are committed.

583
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,390
我们已经告诉家人这个决定了
We already told our family about it,

584
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,530
现在斯凯勒肯定相信
and now Skyler, I'm sure she believes--

585
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,290
她得相信
she needs to believe

586
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,960
一切尽在掌握
that everything is neat and tidy,

587
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,280
她正在心理暗示
and she's telling herself

588
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,560
我在一家漂亮而安静的小实验室工作
that I work in this nice quiet little lab

589
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,700
穿着白大褂  带着袖珍保护装置
with a white lab coat and a pocket protector

590
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,560
我的合同一到期
and when my contract is up

591
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,200
我就只要卸下装备
I'll just simply hang it all up,

592
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,290
摘下帽子  打道回府
tip my hat, and walk away.

593
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,290
天呐
Oh, God.

594
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,830
事情怎么都搞得一团糟了
How did everything get so screwed up?

595
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,230
对  你的确有太多烦心事了
Yeah, you do have a little shit creek action happening.

596
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,430
仅供参考  你可以买个保险
You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle.

597
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,030
这是以防万一的最后一招
This is a last resort back pocket kind of thing,

598
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,290
但你如果真想自保
but if you really got to protect yourself,

599
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,060
就消失吧
uh...disappear.

600
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,930
人间蒸发
Poof.

601
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,360
人间蒸发
Poof?

602
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,830
有个人能帮你们
There's a guy who can make it happen.

603
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,900
就叫他
Call him a, uh...

604
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,030
消失达人吧
disappearer.

605
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,860
需要丰厚的酬劳  得非常丰厚
For a substantial fee, and I do mean substantial,

606
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,860
你和你爱的人可以人间蒸发
you and your loved ones can vanish, untraceable.

607
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,760
他可以帮你们开始崭新的生活
I mean, he sets you up with a whole new life.

608
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,130
什么
What, like a...

609
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,960
就像证人保护计划那种吗
witness protection kind of thing?

610
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,460
比那还高端  完全不会被查到
Beyond. I mean, off the grid.

611
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
有新的身份  新的一切
New identities, new everything.

612
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,130
没人能追踪到你们的行踪
No one would ever be able to trace you.

613
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,330
现在得说清楚  这是终极法宝
Now, be clear, this is an end game,

614
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,500
如果你懂我的意思
if you get my meaning.

615
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,160
没有后悔药吃
I mean, there's no coming back.

616
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,040
你要他的名片吗
You want his card?

617
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,930
天呐  真希望我还有其它选择
God, there's got to be something else that I could do.

618
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,460
找到能让一切都回到正轨的方法
Some way to keep everything from spiraling out of control.

619
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,130
根据你的叙述
Well, I mean, from what you told me,

620
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,630
平克曼将第一个
it sounds like, uh, Pinkman is first up

621
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,600
步入死亡的殿堂
in the imminent demise department.

622
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,930
古斯不会让警方有机会找到杰西的
Gus won't risk letting the police find Jesse.

623
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,760
我知道 他不会让警方有机会的
I know him, he won't

624
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,030
不是我说啊  你们好好想想
I am not even kindding because if you really think about it.

625
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,690
你都看不到  又怎么知道无线电波
You can't even see it. So how can you know just how bad

626
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,080
微波和手机对你产生什么伤害呢
radio frenqueces and microwaves and cellphones this stuff are giving you

627
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,630
也许你去奶奶家
I mean, you could be strolling security of the airpirt

628
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,220
过机场安检的时候
On the way to visit your grandma.

629
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,860
起来了
Wake up bitches!

630
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,740
你会被要求过全身扫描
And then you get wave through a whole body scanner

631
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,820
然后转天你不死也会奄奄一息
And next day you could be dead or dying.

632
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,470
至少是被辐射的奄奄一息了
At least dying fron all the radiation

633
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,300
绝对不是他们所说的对身体无害
that they say is safe, but there's no way

634
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,150
因为辐射浓度很高
Because they have to deliver a concentrated dose, okay?

635
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,890
辐射量足够可以穿透衣服
Enough to penetrate through clothes

636
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,380
日积月累对易受感染的人绝对是个威胁
So the accumulated amount of is definitely dangerous to susceptible individual

637
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,870
尤其是那些从乡下来的人
especially if you from a rural area

638
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,080
我说  老兄
Hey，yo!

639
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,780
臭氧层本来就因为
and the ozone layer's already thin

640
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,630
那些牛放的屁而薄了许多
Because of the cow farts.

641
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,790
我说
Yo

642
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,210
是你啊
Hey.

643
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,990
在我回来之前买好比萨啊
Will you make sure there is pizza here when I get back?

644
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,260
没问题吧  要够大伙吃
All right? Enough for everybody.

645
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,720
没问题啊
I could do that.

646
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,360
我肯定能买
I could definitely do that.

647
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,840
绝对没问题
Not a problem

648
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,330
我能买来  比萨什么的
I can get the stuff, the pizza and the stuff.

649
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,660
但我没多少钱了
But as far as the financial situation you know

650
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,440
等下
Just hanging on

651
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,430
跟你说啊
You know

652
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,630
高剂量的辐射
The concentrated doses is gonna

653
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,190
会对骨髓造成伤害
gonna play hob your bone marrow.

654
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,100
然后还会搅乱...
and it's really gonna mess up...

655
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,680
尤其是如果你有癌症的话
Because--because especially if you have cancer.

656
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,340
还必须要做一个骨髓移植
You know cause if you got to get a bone marrow transplant

657
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,540
也就是...百分之六十
You're odds are...you are 60%...

658
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,300
你也就有百分之六十的机会
you have 60% chance.

659
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,820
再买点面包条
Get some dipping sticks, too

660
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,030
我肯定能买来
I can definetely get dipping sticks.

661
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,800
我能买来的
All right, I can get them.

662
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,150
都给我吸了吧  贱人们
Suck it up. bitches.

663
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,510
起来
Wake up.

664
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,650
起来
Wake up.

665
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,830
怎么了
What's up.

666
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,870
你耳朵怎么了
What's up with your ear?

667
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,560
现在下楼
Downstaris now.

668
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,670
人都哪去了
Where is everybody?

669
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,110
我把你的朋友都请走了
I invited your guests to leave.

670
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,090
知道这人是谁吗
You know who this is?

671
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,770
不知道
No

672
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,210
你应该知道的  他在你家呆了3天
You ought to, he spent at your house for 3 solid day.

673
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,400
然后呢
Ok?

674
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,090
他偷了你的钱
He stoled your money.

675
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,670
然后呢
Ok?

676
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,130
这7万8看着眼熟吗
That 78000 still looks familar?

677
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,300
-就这个  -是的
- This is it?   - That's it

678
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,110
好的
Ok

679
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,740
谢了
Thanks

680
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,510
你想知道接下来我会
You wanna know what's next?

681
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,210
怎样对待尿裤子先生吗
for little Miss pissed in his pants

682
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,220
不想
No

683
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,250
你确定
You're sure no?

684
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,170
连猜都懒得猜
Don't even wanna take a wild guess.

685
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,660
你要杀了他
You are gonna kill him.

686
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,710
我现在是不是该要求你不要杀
This is the part where I am supposed to beg you not to do it?

687
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,650
求求你了
Please...please.

688
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,260
然后呢
And then what?

689
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,130
我是不是应该发誓说
I am supposed to promise cross my heart.

690
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,870
每天都准备好听你们的命令行事
to, like, straighten up and fly right or toe the line

691
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,310
或者其他什么屁话
Some other carp that I am not gonna say.

692
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,720
这就是你演这出戏的目的
Is that what your liitle show here was all about?

693
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,130
你已经如履薄冰了  小子
You are on thin ice, you little shit head,

694
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,870
懂吗
You know that?

695
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,670
你不会杀了他的
You ain't gonna smoke that dude in there.

696
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,050
知道我怎么知道的吗
You know how come I know?

697
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,530
因为你费周折蒙上了他的眼睛
Cause you went to the trouble put a blind fold on him.

698
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,880
我继续睡觉了
I am going back to bed .

699
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,380
你愿意干嘛就干嘛
Knock yourself out.

700
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,640
抱歉久等了
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

701
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,880
耳朵好了吗
How's the ear?

702
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,750
还在养伤
Mending.

703
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,900
有事吗
What can I do for you?

704
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,800
是平克曼的事
It's Pinkman

705
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,520
