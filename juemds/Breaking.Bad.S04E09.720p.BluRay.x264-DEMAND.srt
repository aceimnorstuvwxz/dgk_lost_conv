第四季 第九集
S04E09: Bug

2
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,409
我自己来  我自己来
I got it, I got it.

3
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,390
天啊  玛丽你好烦
Jesus, You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.

4
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,809
早啊

5
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,980
早啊  哥们儿

瞧  我就知道
See, I knew it.

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,390
矿物展其实是你们看脱衣舞的暗号吧
Mineral show just some sort of guy code for strip club.

9
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,650
你有单身的朋友想一起去吗
Hey, you get any singles?

10
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,280
别让他太疯了好吗
Don't let him get too crazy, ok?

11
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,430
他要是再买个大石头回来
Cram one more giant geode in here

12
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,709
我们就只能去睡车库了
we'll be sleeping in the garage.

13
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,720
-我自己能来  -好好
- I got it, I got it. - I'm sorry.

14
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,609
天啊
Christ.

15
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,010
真是人生中最漫长的一周
Longest week ever.

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,610
希望能得到点有用的东西
I just hope we get something good, you know?

17
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,780
帮我祈祷吧
Keep your fingers crossed.

18
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,610
放松点  哥们儿  又不是拍谍战电影
Relax, buddy. This ain't no spy movie.

19
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,420
倒比较像洛奇
It's more like Rocky, you know?

20
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,910
抓住坏人
Get the bad guy!

21
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,040
这是老虎的眼睛  这是战斗的快感*
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,480
一起反抗让他们生存*
Risin' up to keep 'em alive

23
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,330
你  你  你干嘛呢  干嘛回来
What-- What-- What are you doing, buddy?

24
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,270
准备走
Leaving.

25
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,109
不行  你得像上次一样
No, you got to go inside

26
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,209
进去买点东西  免得被人怀疑
and order something like last time to avoid suspicion.

27
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,300
再说了  我还想来杯香草奶昔呢
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.

28
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,510
一会从免下车窗口买
We'll use the drive-through.

29
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,250
好了  来看看我们查到些什么
All right, baby. Let's see what we got.

30
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,080
搞什么
What the hell?

31
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,640
瞧这些
Look at this. Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

32
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,710
工作  家  工作  家
That's work, that's home, that's work, that's home.

33
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,110
这家伙每天两点一线吗
What, this guy goes two places every day all week?

34
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,810
难以置信
It's unbelievable.

35
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,350
狗娘养的炸鸡店老板
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.

36
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,080
汉克  有没有可能
Hank, is it possible that...

37
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,050
只是可能
maybe, just maybe...

38
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,110
他不是你要找的人
he's not your guy?

39
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,980
他这么清白反而可疑
Oh, a guy this clean's got to be dirty.

40
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,950
哥们儿  他在玩什么把戏
What's the play here, buddy?

41
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,880
怎么才能抓住这个人
How do I get this guy?

42
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,750
是啊
Yeah.

43
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,210
怎么办呢
How?

44
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,610
喂  你好
Yes, hi.

45
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,950
我住在多斯维尔 4900街区
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place,

46
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,730
我发现一个非常可疑的人
and I want to report a very suspicious man

47
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,330
正在监视我的邻居
who's lurking in my neighborhood.

48
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,580
他开一辆蓝色轿车
He's sitting in a blue sedan,

49
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,820
盯着一栋房子
and he-- he's been staring at a particular house

50
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,450
很长时间了
for a very long time.

51
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,890
谢谢  非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you so much.

52
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,910
可以的话真是太感谢了
If you would, I would appreciate it.

53
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,480
好了
All right.

54
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,610
准备开工吧
So I guess we better get started.

55
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
我已经做完了
I already did.

56
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
是吗
Yeah?

57
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,890
能给我一只吗
You got one of those for me?

58
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,950
什么
One of those what?

59
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,350
香烟
Cigarette.

60
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,990
那东西还在  好么
It's still in there, all right?

61
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,860
我还没找到下手的机会
I didn't get a chance yet.

62
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,790
给我就是了
Just give me one.

63
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,460
你最近在干嘛
So what have you been up to?

64
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,030
什么
What?

65
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,160
就是每天怎么过的啊
You know, just a day in the life.

66
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,890
你工作完之后都干嘛
What do you do after work?

67
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,130
回家  看电视
Go home, watch TV.

68
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,660
看什么
What do you watch?

69
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,530
不知道  随便看
I don't know. Stuff.

70
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,060
比如呢
Like what?

71
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,590
比如
Like, uh...

72
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,010
冰路前行
Ice Road Truckers.

73
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,990
冰路前行
Ice Road Truckers.

74
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,690
讲什么的
What happens on that one?

75
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,030
讲在冰上开车的人们
Guys drive on ice.

76
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,360
我会做的
I am going to do it.

77
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,630
得吸气才行
You got to inhale, by the way.

78
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,060
你到底怎么了  癌症得的还不够吗
What the hell, man, don't you have enough cancer already?

79
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,060
我说了我要做
Look, I said...I'd do it.

80
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,160
就一定会做的
I'll do it.

81
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,930
好吧  有什么关系
Yeah, well, what does it matter?

82
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,220
反正我们都是要死的人了
We're both dead men anyway.

83
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,430
现在不方便说话吗
Am I, uh, catching you at a bad time?

84
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,860
方便  我有时间
No, I have a few minutes.

85
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,520
我们儿子说
So Mr. I'm Almost 16 So Leave Me Alone

86
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,050
不想大肆庆祝他的生日
doesn't want a big thing for his birthday.

87
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,360
只想和朋友一起过
He just wants to hang out with his friends,

88
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,890
我觉得无所谓  你呢
which is fine by me. You?

89
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,260
我也觉得无所谓
Fine by me.

90
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,190
好吧  所以我就想
Okay. So I figured, uh,

91
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,140
就办个不起眼的家庭聚会  不搞正式的派对
low-key family dinner, no official party,

92
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,360
我们要咬紧牙关
and we bite the bullet and...

93
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,130
给他买辆车
buy him a car--

94
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,630
我想  最好是二手车
Uh, used, I was thinking, would be best.

95
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,280
但是车龄不能超过五年
But no more than five years old.

96
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,790
带安全气囊  质量合格等等
Air bags, safety rated, all that.

97
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,490
你对买什么样的车有想法吗
Do you, um, have any thoughts on what kind,

98
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,390
还是我就直接去...
or should I just go ahead and--

99
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,320
行啊  你就直接去吧
Yeah. No, you just go ahead.

100
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,490
好吧
Okay.

101
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,930
听着  还有一件事
Listen. On another subject,

102
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,320
我得告诉你
I just wanted to tell you that

103
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,660
洗车店生意很好
business is good.

104
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,030
非常好
Really good.

105
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,220
好到了我觉得  你或许...
So good that I'm thinking maybe...

106
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,560
或许你不必再打那一份工了
you don't even need to work your second job.

107
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,380
你开始盈利了?
You're turning a profit?

108
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,030
快了
We're coming close.

109
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,209
再给我们一两个月
Give us another month or two,

110
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,430
我们就能盈利了
and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.

111
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,830
说了这么多
All of this to say

112
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,660
或许你该考虑金盆洗手了
maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.

113
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,730
我正在努力
I'm working on it.

114
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,490
那好
Ok.

115
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,000
喂
Hello.

116
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,090
嗨  伙计  吵醒你了吗
Hey, buddy. Wake you?

117
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,300
没有  汉克  我起来了
No, Hank, I'm up.

118
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
那就好  干什么呢
Oh, good. Uh, what you doing?

119
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,800
我在...
I'm, uh...

120
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,560
听着  我不废话了
Hey, listen, I-I'll cut to it.

121
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,040
我得再请你帮个忙
I got another favor to ask.

122
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,410
我一直在想这个古斯・福林  知道吗
I've been thinking about this Gus Fring, right?

123
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,760
想他总是两点一线
How he never goes anywhere:

124
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,610
一家餐厅  家  一家餐厅  家
one restaurant, home, one restaurant, home,

125
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,630
就这么来来回回
back and forth back and forth?

126
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,900
现在我敢肯定这是他妈狗屁了
Which, now I'm even more convinced is bullshit,

127
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,640
这人另外还有13家餐厅  知道么
because the man owns 13 other restaurants, right?

128
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,510
于是我开始考察他这个小小的商业帝国
So I started thinking about this little empire of his, right?

129
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,110
十四家餐厅  谁在供货
Fourteen restaurants. Who supplies them?

130
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,690
运营的基地在哪里
What's the base of operations?

131
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,980
我简单调查了一下  大发现
So I do a little diggin', and bingo!

132
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,050
这家炸鸡店有个分销基地
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.

133
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,580
离城不远
Uh... It's not far from town.

134
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,110
这地方很大  我是说
The place is huge. I mean--

135
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,890
我正在网上看着呢
I'm looking at it online right now.

136
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,890
我告诉你  这个仓库非常大
I tell you, it's a big warehouse

137
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,709
一排排的家禽养殖场
and rows of these long poultry buildings,

138
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,009
或者是孵化场  随你怎么说
or hatcheries, or whatever you call 'em.

139
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,209
足以藏下非法活动的场所
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.

140
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,710
看起来很有点戏啊
Sounds promising, right?

141
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,410
你怎么说  伙计
So. Whaddya say, buddy?

142
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,580
一起再去实地考察一番吗
Got another field trip in you?

143
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,810
汉克  嗯
You know, Hank. Um...

144
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,770
我是说  听上去很不错
I mean, it sounds great.

145
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,980
真的  可是我
It really does. But I--

146
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,780
你知道的  我从不撒谎
You know, I won't lie, uh--

147
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,310
你正赶上我...
You caught me... somewhat...

148
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,710
身体不适
indisposed.

149
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,290
什么意思  拉稀了?
What do you mean, like taking a dump indisposed?

150
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,910
是啊
Yeah. That's--

151
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,450
真是尴尬  拉稀了
embarrassingly, that's it.

152
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,810
我只是...
You know, it's just...

153
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,040
肠胃不适  整个人都
upset stomach, you know, and everything...

154
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,890
-是啊  -身体失调了
- Yeah. - It's out of control.

155
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,050
实在来得突然
Really explosive.

156
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,110
德州-墨西哥的混合风味太糟了
Bad Tex-Mex.

157
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,209
-就是商场那个  -知道了  知道了
-At the mall.   -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

158
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,080
我懂了  不用说的太详细了
I get it. You don't have to paint me a picture.

159
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,050
出门一趟一个人带尿布就够可以的了
Probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway.

160
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,880
是啊  真对不住  汉克
Yeah. I'm sorry, Hank.

161
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,410
嘿  别这样
Hey, don't be.

162
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,880
最近我老是麻烦你
I've been asking a lot of you lately.

163
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,450
很谢谢你
I appreciate it.

164
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,580
我另外请人送我吧
I'll find another ride for this one.

165
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,480
另外请人
Another ride?

166
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,650
对  我肯定能找到别人送我的
Yeah. I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.

167
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,609
比如我的训练师  查克
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.

168
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,210
或许可以问问他
Maybe I'll ask him.

169
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,709
听着  我  我
Look, I'm-- I'm--

170
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,620
这病估计也就一天
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.

171
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,450
至多两天
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.

172
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,580
嗯  你能不能等上
And, um... Do you think you could possibly hold off

173
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,380
一两天
for a day or two?

174
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,250
哎  伙计  我是说  你知道
Aw, jeez, buddy. I mean, I-- You know--

175
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,810
我只是
You know, I just--

176
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,250
我真的是
I would just really...

177
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,180
非常高兴能送你去
love to be the one to be able to-- to take you there, and--

178
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,790
我自己也很愉快
I mean, I have just really enjoyed, you know,

179
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,510
能和你一块度过这段时光
the time with you,

180
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,750
而且还能帮上你的忙
and helping you.

181
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,250
好吧  既然这对你来说这么重要
Okay, sure. If it means that much to you.

182
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,310
等你好了
Just, you know, give me a call

183
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,230
打个电话给我  如何
when you're feeling up to it, all right?

184
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,450
谢谢  我会的  好
Thank you. I will. Okay.

185
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,980
再见
Bye.

186
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,609
-喂  -麦克
- Yeah.  - Uh, Mike.

187
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,309
听着  我只想跟你说
Listen. I just want to say, first off,

188
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,080
首先  别生气
don't be angry.

189
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,210
什么事  沃尔特
What is it, Walter?

190
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,680
我的连襟
My brother-in-law,

191
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,910
我的那位毒品管制局的兄弟
My DEA-- He--

192
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,850
不久之后  他也许就会
Soon, he will probably,

193
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,540
也可以说马上  他会去到
in the near future, take a ride out to

194
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,390
一个特定的分配中心
a certain distribution center,

195
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,610
去调查些东西
to look around for things.

196
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,050
就调查些东西  是的  没错
Look around for things. And... Yeah.

197
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,150
麦克
Mike?

198
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,410
-这些都要送去哪  -其他地方
- Where's this all going? - Elsewhere.

199
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,510

Thank you. Please give this to your car care professional.

200
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,200
今天来一个全车手工上蜡
So. A hand wax for you today?

201
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,370
好的  很好

请把单子给您的专业汽车护理专家

203

黑色探索者对吧
And the black Explorer?

204
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,909
我们当然可以清洗您的车地板垫  可说真的
Well, of course we could shampoo your floor mats, but really,

205
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,370
豪华彻底清洗才是您最好的选择
deluxe detailing is the best bang for your buck.

206
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,800
对了  SUV车型要额外收费
Oh, and SUVs are extra.

207
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,480
请把单子给您的专业汽车护理专家
And please give this to your car care professional.

208
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,810
谢谢惠顾
Thank you!

209
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,300
请把单子给您的专业汽车护理专家
Please give this to your car care professional.

210
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,310
你好啊  斯凯
Hey, Sky.

211
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,070
天呐  是你啊  泰德
Oh, my God. Ted.

212
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,370
你来是...
What are you, uh--

213
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,109
我听办公室里的人
Someone from the office, uh,

214
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,380
说你在这工作  所以我想
said you worked down here, so I thought I'd...

215
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,980
来拜访一下
come down and say hi.

216
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,180
你好
Hello.

217
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,580
你看上去气色不错
You look great.

218
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,980
哪有  我都快要
No. I'm gonna like--

219
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,860
也许快要看上去像个疯婆子了
I probably just look crazed.

220
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,280
别瞎说  你看上去很幸福
Not at all. You look happy.

221
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,050
上次我见到你时
Last time I saw you--

222
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,410
你好
Hi, there.

223
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,950
斯凯勒  我之所以来
Uh, thing is, Skyler, um,

224
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
是因为我想和你谈谈
I really need to talk to you.

225
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,110
泰德
Ted,

226
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,750
我不认为我们还有什么好谈的了
I really don't think we have anything to talk about.

227
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,410
事实上  我们有
Actually, we do.

228
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,210
一次审计
An audit?

229
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,510
等等  明天要进行一次审计
Wait, an audit tomorrow?

230
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,750
他们多久前通知你的
How long have you had this?

231
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,090
有一段时间了
Awhile.

232
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,480
我一直在做思想斗争  想要不要联系你
I'd... debated, you know, contacting you.

233
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,780
联系我  干吗不直接找个律师  泰德
Contact me? What about a lawyer? Ted--

234
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,480
泰德  这是
Ted, this is--

235
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,043
这可是刑事侦缉处的通知
This is the CID.

236
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,910
属于刑事案件
The Criminal Division.

237
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,620
天哪  你可是面对的重罪的起诉
My God, you facing a felony charge here.

238
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,160
除了已欠的应缴税款外还有十万美金的罚款
$100,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe,

239
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,350
外加还有五年刑期
plus five years in prison!

240
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,310
是的  情况很糟糕
Yeah. It's bad.

241
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,280
是的  情况的确很糟糕
Yeah. It most certainly is.

242
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,370
听着  我的想法是
Look, here's the thing.

243
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,880
我在想  你是否可以
I was wondering, maybe, if um,

244
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,990
帮我一把
there's some way you could help with this.

245
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,230
帮你一把  怎么帮
Help? Help how?

246
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,080
利用你的帐目知识
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are,

247
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,570
也许你能够
maybe there's some way you could, uh,

248
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,309
帮我撤销一些账目
undo what's in there.

249
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,330
你要我帮你做假账
You want me to uncook your books?

250
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,060
也许有些方法  或者一些小技巧
Maybe there's some method, or some accounting trick

251
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,760
-你可以用来...  -泰德
- you could, you know, use-- - Ted.

252
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,830
这不会像你所想的那样简单
It doesn't work like that.

253
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,190
木已成舟  无力回天
The damage is already--

254
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,220
我的名字
My name.

255
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,760
那上面都有我的签名
My signatures are all over those books.

256
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,990
斯凯勒  我是责任人  不是你
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.

257
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,750
我来解释下接下来会发生什么
Let me explain what's gonna happen here, okay?

258
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,060
一旦刑事侦缉处发现这个税收欺诈行为
Once the CID sees this as willful tax fraud,

259
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,220
他们会为你专门立案调查
there are going to build the strongest possible case against you,

260
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,240
而且他们一旦开始了那步
and once they start down that path,

261
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,310
八成你就难逃罪责了
they have an 80% conviction rate.

262
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,350
因为他们被授权获取你的信件
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail,

263
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,350
窃听你的电话  而且还不仅仅是你的  泰德
and tap your phones-- and not just you, Ted.

264
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,520
只要与这账目有关的人都会被牵连
Everyone involved in those books.

265
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,520
我不能容忍这种事情发生在我身上
I can't have this in my life.

266
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,150
我不能被审计
I cannot be audited.

267
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,450
斯凯勒  你  你
Skyler, you-- you--

268
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,120
你会没事的  他们针对的是我
You're going to be fine, okay? They're after me.

269
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,380
他们只想抓到头目  不是某个洗车房的收银员
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.

270
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,270
无意冒犯  对不起
No offense. I'm sorry.

271
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,380
我
I, uh,

272
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,680
我不希望你担心
I don't want you to worry, okay?

273
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,330
我会找到方法解决的
I'm gonna figure out a way through this.

274
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,500
总有办法的
Somehow. Okay?

275
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,510
这里
Here.

276
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,170
就在这
Right here.

277
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,410
他准备杀了他吗
So is he gonna kill him?

278
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,930
谁准备杀了谁
Is who gonna kill who?

279
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,110
古斯
Gus.

280
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,810
他准备杀了怀特老师的连襟吗
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?

281
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,410
我是说  现在做这些都是因为他  对吧
I mean, he's the reason for all this here, right?

282
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:09,010
因为干掉这么一个人对他而言很合乎逻辑
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.

283
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,000
一个混蛋毒品管制局探员
A-hole DEA agent,

284
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,970
到处找麻烦
pokin' around your junk--

285
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,870
谁想要这种待遇
Who needs that, right?

286
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,970
除掉他似乎
Makes sense to get rid of him...

287
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,630
也合情合理
for good.

288
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,530
可杀了一个警察
But killing a cop--

289
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,900
我不知道
I don't know.

290
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,470
要是调查你的人突然死了
It could look suspicious if, uh,

291
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,320
那样会使你看上去更加可疑吧
the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.

292
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,750
还有怀特先生
Then there's-- there's Mr. White.

293
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,509
如果有家人被杀
Who'd be even more ape shit

294
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,210
谁会怒不可遏
if he had family getting murdered.

295
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,080
他不会再为古斯制毒了
He'd never cook for Gus again.

296
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,610
看来要考虑的事情有很多啊
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.

297
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,860
如果这个人出事
If something were to happen to the man,

298
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,920
你会有意见吗
would you have a problem with that?

299
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,350
谁会真正在意我怎么想
Who really cares what I think?

300
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,510
婊子养的
Son of a bitch!

301
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,510
你缓一缓  小子  我们得困在这儿一会儿了
You get comfortable, kid. We may be here a while.

302
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,210
-喂  -趴下
- Hey. - Get down!

303
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,140
喂

304
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,620
告诉他们

305
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,250
我同意

306
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,984
-我该问问是怎么回事么  -是我就不多问
- Should I even ask?  - I wouldn't.

307
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,730
怎么回事  这也成了惯例吗
So what is it? Kinda be a regular thing now.

308
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,533
边制毒边处理尸体  老天
Meth cooking and corpse disposal? Jesus.

309
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,510
给我们拿个空桶  沃特
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.

310
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,570
这次又是怎么回事
What was it this time?

311
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,970
是哪个倒霉的混蛋  惹恼了古斯
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?

312
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,740
还是古斯又需要作何暗示
Or did Gus just need to send another message?

313
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,410
你闭嘴
Shut your mouth.

314
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,210
你自己闭嘴  否则我来动手
You shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you.

315
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,300
我不许你对我或杰西说什么
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.

316
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,040
把桶拿来
Just get the barrel.

317
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,850
如果你想要报警
And if you ever plan on calling the cops

318
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,870
揭发我们任何一人
on one of my guys again,

319
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,540
自便吧  准备好两个桶子
you go ahead and get two barrels.

320
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,670
我有话说
Yo, like, uh,

321
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,840
我从没感谢
I guess I never thanked you for

322
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,670
你救了我
what you did.

323
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,040
多谢
Thanks.

324
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,710
下次  别像个白痴傻站着
Next time, don't stand there like an idiot.

325
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,810
移动脚步  快跑
Move your feet, run and so forth.

326
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,110
但是说真的
But seriously, what--

327
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,470
古斯打的什么算盘
what was the deal with Gus?

328
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,910
-算盘  -那个狙击手
- Deal? - The Terminator shit?

329
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,910
他径直朝子弹走去
Walking right into the bullets?

330
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,770
他到底在干嘛
What the hell was he doing?

331
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,340
卡特尔集团需要古斯
The cartel needs Gus.

332
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,909
需要他的销售网络
His distribution network.

333
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,580
他们不想杀他
They're not looking to kill him.

334
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,210
可是  我们剩下的人  就无所谓了
But what? The rest of us are like, open season?

335
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,770
他会为此有所行动吗
Is he doing anything about that?

336
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,309
还是我们就继续
Or do we just keep hanging out

337
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,410
出去当枪靶  而他...
for target practice while he's--

338
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:51,386
孩子
Kid.

339
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,450
够了  你有问题的话
Enough. You got questions,

340
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,110
自己去问他
ask him yourself.

341
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,640
还有这里  未上报收入
And here again. Unreported income.

342
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,510
离现在有一年多了
That's more than a year straight so far.

343
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,370
你作何解释呢
Do you want to say something about this?

344
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,440
我看不太懂了
Because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.

345
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,070
我得...
Well, I-- I'd have to, um,

346
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,370
看看收据的复印件
have a look at the copies of the receipts

347
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,770
来提醒提醒我
to refresh my memory.

348
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,870
您请自便  贝内克先生
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.

349
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,770
这是我们此行的目的
That's why we're here.

350
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,410
抱歉我迟到了
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

351
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,940
我迷路了
I got lost.

352
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,110
-嗨  泰德  -斯凯
- Hey, Ted. - Sky.

353
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,610
这楼太让人困惑了
This building is so confusing.

354
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
到处都是门
There are doors everywhere.

355
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,740
嗨  这位是
Hi. You are--

356
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,570
特别探员詹姆斯・贝卡尔斯
Special Agent James Bekaris.

357
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,370
真特别
Ooh. Special.

358
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,570
斯凯勒・怀特
Skyler White.

359
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,680
怀特女士  你是记录这些
Ms. White. You are the accountant

360
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,660
财务报告的会计员
of record for many of these reports.

361
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,060
-是这样吗  -没错
- Is that correct? - Guilty as charged.

362
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,020
也许你可以解释一下
Well then, perhaps you can shed some light

363
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,610
这些遗失收入的记录
on this history of missing revenue.

364
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,370
-遗失  -是的
- Missing? - Uh-huh.

365
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,410
-不会吧  都在这儿  -没有
- No, it's there. - No.

366
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,200
所有的收入都肯定流入了公司的账上
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company.

367
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,710
却没有记录在你们的报表里
But it's not all accounted for in your reports.

368
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,570
我来瞧瞧
Hmm, let's take a look.

369
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,370
这笔记录在这儿呢
Well, you know, this account here?

370
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,300
这是凯勒先生的账户
That is Mr. Keller's account,

371
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,190
凯勒先生是泰德父亲的老友
and Mr. Keller's an old friend of Ted's dad,

372
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,630
他总是电子支付
and he always sends an electronic payment,

373
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,620
这最让我烦了
which personally I hate,

374
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,580
因为我喜欢纸质支票
because I'm a real paper person,

375
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,070
可凯勒先生是环保人士
but Mr. Keller's one of those environmental people.

376
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,709
总之  他不付实体支票
So anyway, since there wasn't a physical check,

377
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,160
我没有记在账本里  不过
I didn't enter it into the book, but...

378
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,310
钱肯定在那儿
the money's there.

379
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,740
怀特女士  你读过工业相关章程第六章吗
Ms. White, you've read Section 61 of the IRC?

380
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,580
我不太明白你说什么
I... did not follow what you just said.

381
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,810
一个企业的总体收入是如何界定的
How gross income for a business is defined.

382
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,309
-你无权这么做  -我想我可以
- You're not allowed to do that. - Well, I think I am.

383
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,910
不  你不可以
No, you're not.

384
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,060
你知道大家的意见各有不同
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?

385
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,610
人人都有发言权的
Everyone's got one.

386
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,270
但说真的  我可以
But seriously, I am.

387
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,450
不管是电子付账
Look, it doesn't matter if its an electronic check

388
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,570
还是实体付账  收入就是收入
or a paper check, income is income.

389
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,040
你不能不上报
You're not allowed to not declare it.

390
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,110
我把这些都输入进了记账软件
When I input everything into the Quicken,

391
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,520
没有一项标红  就说明
nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean

392
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,540
没有问题  对吧
it's okay, right?

393
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,640
-使用Quicken?  -是的
-Quicken.   -Uh-huh.

394
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:34,040
这种规模的公司  你用记账软件做账
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.

395
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,509
是啊  你们这里也用吗
I did. Oh, do you guys use that here?

396
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,640
那东西最棒了
'Cause it is the best.

397
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,198
就像电脑上装了计算器  特别神
It's like having a calculator on your computer. Amazing.

398
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,683
怀特女士  你是怎么得到这份工作的
Ms. White, how did you get this job?

399
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,409
泰德雇了我
Oh, Ted hired me.

400
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,010
不  我指的是你的职业证书
No. I mean your qualifications.

401
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,910
你拿的是什么证书
What are your qualifications?

402
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,410
在哪里接受的培训
Where did you get your training?

403
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,810
我倒是没有参加过培训
Ooh, well I haven't had any training per se,

404
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,370
我就是天生擅长处理数字
I've always been naturally good with numbers.

405
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,270
对数字的直觉
Got a good instinct for them.

406
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,110
对吧  泰迪
Right, Teddy?

407
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,510
好吧
Right.

408
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,410
我开始明白了
This is all falling into place now.

409
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,270
怀特女士  我还有一个问题
Ms. White, I just have to ask.

410
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,110
你没有在别处做会计吧
You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?

411
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,210
眼下没有
Right now? No.

412
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,170
我现在在洗车场做收银员
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

413
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,010
我不太明白刚才是怎么回事
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.

414
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,510
总之是好事
What happened is good news.

415
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,910
不了解法律并不等于犯罪
Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.

416
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,609
不过是无知而已
It equates to ignorance.

417
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,970
你只管把补税缴齐  交上罚金
Look, pay your back taxes, pay the penalties,

418
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,240
该做什么做什么  把这事忘掉
and move on from this. Just put it behind you.

419
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,310
拿什么来缴
Pay with what?

420
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,819
我欠他们61万7千块
I owe them $617,000.

421
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:48,210
-我拿什么...  -自己想办法  好不好
- What am I... - Look, just figure it out. All right?

422
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,610
你刚刚逃脱牢狱之灾
You just dodged prison.

423
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,500
变卖资产  把那辆宝马处理掉
Sell your assets. Get rid of the BMW,

424
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,809
用房子做二次抵押贷款
take out a second mortgage on your house.

425
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,670
二次抵押  我房子已经被扣了
Take a mortgage? I have a lien on my house.

426
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,050
我已经没有资产  没有可以变卖的了
I don't have any assets. There are no assets left to sell.

427
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,070
泰德
Ted.

428
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,210
如果你不缴罚金  他们就会重启调查
If you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation.

429
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,940
我刚刚编的那些谎
And that little fiction I just spun up there

430
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,870
立刻就会穿帮
will completely unravel.

431
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,170
你必须想办法解决
You have to settle.

432
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,370
我倒希望能
Wish I could.

433
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,270
请进
Come in.

434
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,410
希望你饿了
I hope you brought an appetite.

435
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,610
算是吧
Yeah. I guess.

436
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,210
麦克说你有疑问
Mike mentioned you have some questions.

437
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,740
对
Yeah.

438
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,540
我们先吃饭  然后再谈
We'll eat first. And then we'll talk.

439
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,070
好的
Right on.

440
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,770
叫我来做什么
What am I doing here?

441
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,210
我知道你很担心
I know you have concerns.

442
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,220
昨天在农场上
What happened yesterday

443
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,840
我的人出了事
to my man at the farm...

444
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,510
那是件可怕的事
It was a terrible thing.

445
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,540
脑袋被打开花的那哥们吗  是吓人
Oh, the dude getting his head blown off? Yeah.

446
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,240
我请你来我家
I have invited you into my home,

447
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,370
烹制菜肴
prepared food,

448
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:38,110
好跟你坐下来谈谈
so we could sit and talk.

449
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,110
像男人一样  谈生意上的事
Discuss what's going on in this business,

450
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,550
我们的生意
our business, like men.

451
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,910
我会解释现在发生的事情
And I will explain everything that's happening.

452
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,070
解答你的疑问
I will answer your questions.

453
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,250
不过首先  我需要你
But first, I need you...

454
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,350
回答我的一个问题
to answer one question for me.

455
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,910
你能用沃尔特的配方制毒吗
Can you cook Walter's formula?

456
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,440
什么
What?

457
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,210
沃尔特的配方
Walter's formula.

458
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,810
你能制出那种货吗
Can you produce this product?

459
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,270
不借助他人
Without any help, alone?

460
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,510
不能
No.

461
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,270
为什么
Why?

462
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,840
你问我能不能脱离怀特老师  做他的冰毒
You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal? Without him?

463
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,710
就我吗
Me?

464
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,920
一个嗑药的废物
The junkie loser you were about to waste

465
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,420
上个月还差点儿被你宰掉丢进沙漠里的家伙
and dump in the desert a month ago?

466
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,010
这就是你的计划
This is your plan, huh?

467
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,330
请我进来你家  做了这么一桌子东西
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is,

468
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,070
跟我称兄道弟  让我自以为
be my buddy and... and make me feel

469
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,170
是个人物了
important,

470
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,110
然后杀了怀特老师
then get me to keep cooking for you

471
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,610
让我给你继续制毒
after you kill Mr. White.

472
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,470
你乐意像男人一样谈
You want to... you want to talk like men?

473
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,870
我就给你说句男人的话
Let's talk like men!

474
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,110
你要杀怀特老师  就得把我也杀了
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.

475
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,340
我没有问你这个问题
That is not what I asked you.

476
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,840
你在这里是因为
You are here

477
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,810
与卡特尔集团的关系已经无法维系
because circumstances with the Cartel are untenable.

478
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,040
我需要你的帮助
And I need your help.

479
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,940
我需要你来阻止一场混战
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.

480
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,810
现在  如果你愿意
Now, if you would,

481
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,210
回答我的问题
answer the question.

482
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,834
你要走了
Hey, you get it out?

483
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,720
对
Yeah.

484
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,180
怀特老师
Yo, Mr. White. Hey, uh,

485
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,980
我非常需要跟你谈谈  我...我不知道
I really got to talk to you. I... I don't know

486
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,780
你是在家还是在哪里
if you're with your family or whatever,

487
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,950
但是这事非常要紧  所以我希望
but this is important, so I'm hoping

488
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,810
你能过来一趟
you could come over.

489
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,380
-谢天谢地  -请进
- Thank God.  - Come on in.

490
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,640
你...要啤酒吗
You uh... You want a beer?

491
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,750
-还是喝别的  -不用
- Or something? - No.

492
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,730
-我能坐吗  -好好
- Should I sit down? - Oh, yeah, yeah.

493
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,480
不好意思  你坐
Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.

494
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,010
行  那个...
Okay, so, um...

495
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,680
好吧  那个...
Okay. So...

496
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,180
据说他们...
word has come down that they...

497
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,210
他们想让我去墨西哥
They want me to go to Mexico.

498
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,480
古斯和卡特尔集团
There's some sort of war brewing

499
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,050
现在正在打仗
between Gus and the Cartel.

500
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,510
"有人传话下来"
"Word has come down?"

501
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,510
对  卡特尔集团一直在干扰古斯的生意
Yeah, the cartel has been messing with Gus's operation.

502
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,580
就像一样传递信息
Like jacking trucks to like, send a message,

503
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,980
还记得昨天那个人吗
and you know, yesterday, that dude

504
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,380
我们抬进来的那个
we brought to the lab?

505
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,980
他们就在我眼前把他给毙了
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.

506
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,380
把他脑袋给打爆了
Just blew his head open.

507
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,050
一个狙击手在大老远就对准了他
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.

508
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,110
不管怎么样  他们始终不敢接近
Anyway, they've been holding them off,

509
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,510
可一边卡特尔集团为争霸主地位
but between the cartel taking pot shots

510
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,780
一边你的妹夫未查真相  广泛撒网
and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net

511
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,310
你管这叫什么
over the whole deal, it's like, what do you call,

512
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,050
两难境地
a rock and a hard place situation.

513
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,480
所以古斯快抗不住了
So Gus is gonna cave.

514
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,910
所以塔特尔集团
So the cartel wants half

515
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,480
想要分掉古斯的业务的一半
of Gus' entire operation, and they want

516
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,310
还想要你的制毒配方  他打算给他们
your formula, and he's gonna give it to them.

517
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,710
我准备给他们
Well, I-- I gotta give it to them.

518
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:07,950
我应该去墨西哥
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico

519
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,780
教一帮卡特尔的毒师
and teach a bunch of cartel chemists

520
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,810
如何大量制造冰毒
how to cook a batch of blue.

521
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,440
古斯不相信你  所以...
You know, Gus doesn't trust you, so...

522
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,710
我会去  你才是毒师  伙计
I gotta go-- I mean, you're the chemist, man!

523
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,310
不是我
You know, not me.

524
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,780
比如说  我去
Let's say I go down

525
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,980
到那里  到丛林里去
to, you know, go over there, go to the jungle

526
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,580
或者随便什么地方
or-- or whatever.

527
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,980
比方说他们有真正的化学家
You know, and say they got actual chemists,

528
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,750
比如毒师  问我化学问题
like cartel chemists, asking me chemistry stuff

529
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,210
我都答不上来  因为我不是你
that I don's know how to answer, because I'm not you.

530
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:38,309
还有  如果所有的设备
And what if all the equipment

531
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,910
都标注的墨西哥语  不是英语怎么办
is uh, is in Mexican, instead of English?

532
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,310
那怎么办
You know? Oh!

533
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,250
我不知道  我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

534
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,740
如果我搞砸了
I mean, if I mess this up,

535
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,780
我就死定了
I am dead, you know?

536
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,950
我们就都完了
All of us!

537
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,910
怀特老师  听着  我要你帮忙
Mr White. Look, I-- I need your help.

538
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,860
好吧  或许你能
Okay, maybe you could--

539
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,070
或许你能指导我
Maybe you could, like, coach me

540
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,950
或调教一下  行吗  或者给我点注解
or something, you know? Or you can give me some notes.

541
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,280
怀特老师
Mr. White.

542
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,180
所以你见过古斯了
So you saw Gus?

543
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,710
什么  没
What? No.

544
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,010
-你没见古斯  -没
- You didn't see Gus. - No.

545
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,380
那是谁跟你说的这些
Then who told you all of that?

546
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,790
我刚说了  是传的话
It was passed down, like I said.

547
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,750
传的话
Passed down?

548
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,410
谁传的
By whom?

549
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,780
麦克和他们
By, uh... By Mike and them.

550
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,980
是他们说的  他们
They did. They--

551
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,780
所以"他们"不包括古斯
So "They" Doesn't include Gus.

552
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,780
你没和古斯在一起过
You haven't been with Gus.

553
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,609
你没见过古斯  没和古斯说过话
You haven't seen Gus. You haven't spoken to Gus.

554
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,609
你为什么...
Why are you...

555
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,180
你昨晚没在古斯家
You weren't at Gus's house last night.

556
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,110
什么
What?

557
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,409
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

558
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,210
天呐
J-Jesus--

559
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,710
还在这里
It's still here.

560
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,210
-还在  -天呐
- It's still here. - Oh, Jesus.

561
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,880
你看着我的眼睛  告诉我
You look me in the eye and you tell me

562
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,480
你昨晚没在他家
that you weren't at his house last night.

563
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,030
我
I, um...

564
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,370
听着  我没机会
Look, I didn't have a chance.

565
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,680
满意了吗
All right?

566
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,909
好吧  我就知道你会有这反应
Okay, I knew you would react this way.

567
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,640
我就知道你会抓狂
I knew you would freak out

568
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,080
不会信我
and wouldn't believe me--

569
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,910
所以我才没提这事
that's why I didn't say anything.

570
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,780
那里有一大锅汤  你知道吗
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew, okay?

571
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,450
他炖了一大锅东西
He just made this one big pot,

572
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,930
我们都从里面舀了吃  我该怎么办
and we both ate from it-- what was I supposed to do?

573
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,009
毒死自己吗
Huh? Poison myself?

574
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,310
两小时十八分钟
Two hours and 18 minutes,

575
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,440
你就没想出个办法来下毒
and you could have figured a way to give it to him.

576
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,810
-他一直没离开过房间  -你这个骗子
- He never left the room! - You lying little shit!

577
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,610
你只有一件事要做
You had one thing to do!

578
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,480
一件事  只要你做那一件事  我多说一句
One thing! That is the only thing, I might add,

579
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,810
那能救我们俩的命
that would save our lives.

580
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,610
而你当时就在那里  就在他家
And you were right there. You were in his house!

581
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,610
你却没胆量下手
And you didn't have the guts to do it.

582
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,210
两小时十八分钟
Two hours and 18 minutes?

583
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,020
你从没想过要杀他  是吗
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?

584
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,750
你怎么知道我昨晚在他家
How did you know I was at his house last night?

585
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,110
你跟踪我
Were you following me?

586
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,310
这个  我靠的是这个
This. This is how I knew.

587
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,760
你在我的车上装了监视器
You bugged my car?

588
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,650
晚上7点10分到9点28分
7:10 to 09:28 P.M.

589
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,509
两小时十八分钟
Two hours and 18 minutes,

590
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,860
可你从没想下手  对吗
but you had no intentions, did you?

591
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,010
一点念头都没有
Not the slightest intention.

592
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:40,020
-我为你做了那么多事  -你居然监视我
-Everything that I have done for you,  -you put a bug on my car?

593
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,090
抱歉  你为我做了那么多事
I'm sorry. After everything you've done for me?

594
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,420
你为我做了什么
What you've done for me?

595
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,490
你已经杀了我  这就是你做的
You've killed me is what you've done.

596
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,320
你已经签了我的死刑执行令
You've signed my death warrant.

597
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,120
想听我的建议
And now you want advice?

598
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,409
好  那我就给你建议
All right, I'll give you advice.

599
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,209
去墨西哥把事情搞砸吧  我知道你会的
Go to Mexico and screw up, like I know you will,

600
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,710
然后命丧哪里都不知道
and wind up in a barrel somewhere!

601
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,710
天呐
Oh, God!

602
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,210
能走吗
Can you walk?

603
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,310
能
Yeah.

604
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,710
给我滚  别再回来了
You get the fuck out of here and never come back.
