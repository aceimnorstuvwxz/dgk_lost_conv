1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,020
不是说看阴道吗
Yo, I thought I was going to see some, like, vaginas.

2
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:22,061
我没说她画的是阴道
I didn't say she actually painted vaginas.

3
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,012
我是说
I said

4
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:25,079
她画的东西
some of her paintings

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,090
看着像阴道
looked like vaginas.

6
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,075
真的吗
Uh, seriously?

7
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:33,075
这差的太远了吧
Not even close.

8
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:38,032
乔治亚·欧姬芙能画出任何东西
Georgia O'Keeffe painted all kinds of stuff.

9
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:42,062
她周围的任何事物
Everyday items, her surroundings.

10
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:47,016
有些作品能唤起人的性欲
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.

11
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:51,016
这就是她
It's who she was.

12
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,060
我见过的阴道没一个长这样的
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

13
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:58,021
她精神正常吗
This chick have medical issues?

14
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,037
这幅画...
This particular painting--

15
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,047
是扇门
...is of a door.

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,070
这儿还有其他门可以看看吗
Any other doors we can check out?

17
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:10,097
比如真的门...
Like, real ones or...

18
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,098
我还是没搞明白
You know, I-I-I don't get it.

19
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,098
为什么有人会画门
Why would anyone paint a picture of a door

20
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:22,061
还不厌其烦地画那么多次
over and over again, like, dozens of times?

21
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:24,002
因为都不一样啊
But it wasn't the same.

22
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:26,042
不  那都一样
Uh, yeah, it was.

23
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:29,005
虽然主题都是门  但作品是在变化的
It was the same subject, but it was different every time.

24
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,039
每次的灯光不同
The light was different.

25
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:31,075
每次画家的心情不同
Her mood was different.

26
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,032
她每次作画  都有新的元素
She saw something new every time she painted it.

27
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:37,089
这还不算神经病吗
And that's not psycho to you?

28
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:41,023
照你这说法  那我们为什么要反复做同一件事
Well, then, why should we do anything more than once?

29
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:43,093
那我是不是该只抽这一支烟
Should I just smoke this one cigarette?

30
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:47,057
或者只做一次爱
Maybe we should only have sex once if it's the same thing.

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,020
别
Whoa, no--

32
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:51,050
只看得到一次日落吗
Should we just watch one sunset?

33
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:55,021
还是只活一天
Or live just one day.

34
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:57,001
因为每天都是崭新的
Because it's new every time.

35
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,074
每次都是新的经历
Each time, it's a different experience.

36
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,018
好了  行了
Okay, fine.

37
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:05,001
我觉得那幅牛的头骨还好
I guess the cow skull pictures were cool,

38
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:07,005
但门的话
but a door?

39
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:09,052
我还是那看法
I will say it again.

40
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:11,088
一扇门
A door.

41
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,092
门怎么了嘛
Why not a door?

42
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:16,079
有时你对事物恋恋不忘
Sometimes you get fixated on something,

43
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:19,022
而你却可能不知道为什么
and you might not even get why.

44
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:21,079
你发散思维  顺其自然地展开想象
You open yourself up and go with the flow,

45
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,053
天马行空地想象
wherever the universe takes you.

46
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:29,053
好吧  然后她天马行空地想到了门
Okay, so the universe took her to a door,

47
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:31,047
还迷恋上了门
and she got all obsessed with it

48
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,047
还强迫自己画了20次  直到它完美无缺
and just had to paint it 20 times until it was perfect.

49
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:38,091
我可没这么说  因为人无完人  金无足赤
No, I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.

50
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:40,061
是吗
Yeah?

51
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:45,011
有的
Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:46,091
有些事就很完美
Some things.

53
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:02,093
真甜蜜
Oh, that was so sweet,

54
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:04,083
不过我刚才呕吐了一点在嘴里
I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit.

55
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:09,050
要你承认一次我是对的就那么难吗
You can't admit just for once that I'm right.

56
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,067
有那么难吗
Come on.

57
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:14,008
那叫欧姬芙的女人一次又一次地在尝试
That O'Keeffe lady kept trying over and over

58
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:18,018
直到把那烂门画到最完美
until that stupid door was perfect.

59
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:20,078
不  那门代表她的家  她对它有感情
No. That door was her home, and she loved it.

60
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:24,095
对我而言  最重要的就是留住那种感觉
To me, that's about making that feeling last.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:50,020
绝

62
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:50,020
命

63
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:50,020
毒

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:50,020
师

65
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:50,020
第三季

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:50,020
第十一集

67
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:02,039
好了  要开始了  准备好了吗
All right, here we go. You ready?

68
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:08,099
加油  走一步  一步就好
Come on, give me a step. Give me one step.

69
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,050
不行
Nope.

70
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:18,010
不行  不行  拉我上去
Nope, that's it. Take me up.

71
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:19,064
汉克  你能行的
You can do this, Hank.

72
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,057
加油  痛是正常的
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.

73
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,008
要重新走路当然很痛
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

74
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,064
我一脚揣你屁股里才叫痛  玛丽
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

75
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:28,055
要你的脚真能抬那么高  尽管放马过来
Hey, if you can get your leg up that high, I say go for it.

76
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,063
-拉我上去  上去  -好  休息一下
- Take me up. Take me up. - All right, coffee break.

77
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,088
休息一分钟
We're gonna let you rest for a minute,

78
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:33,012
然后再来一次
and then we're gonna try it again.

79
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,020
不用了
Never mind about your coffee break.

80
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,022
赶紧拉我上去  疼死我了  我受够了
Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.

81
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:41,048
好吧  脱下来吧
Well, this picked up a very left-off.

82
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:44,030
加油  汉克叔叔  你能行的
Come on, Uncle Hank. You can do it.

83
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,010
不然你怎么出得了院
How else are you going to get out of here?

84
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:47,000
你就没有朋友吗
Don't you have any friends?

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,031
天  你就没正事做吗
I mean Jesus, find something better to do.

86
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:50,071
我不需要你们看到我被挂在这儿
I don't need everyone staring at me

87
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:53,081
像骆驼的驼峰一样
hanging here like a camel's ball sack.

88
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,075
汉克  他只是想给你点鼓励
Hank, he just wants to be supportive.

89
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,015
没关系
It's all right.

90
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,015
我很快回来
I'll be right back.

91
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,082
好吗  我很快回来
Okay? I'll be right back.

92
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,066
你们打算什么时候把我弄下来
You gonna get me out of here sometime today?

93
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,090
斯凯
Sky--

94
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,090
我收到账单了
We got our first bill,

95
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:20,071
如果你还坚持...
and, you know, if you're still insistent--

96
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:22,003
当然坚持
I am.

97
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,073
作好准备
Prepare yourself.

98
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,009
接下来每周都会有账单  所以
They're gonna start coming in weekly like that, so...

99
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,053
没问题
Okay.

100
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:44,060
你确定你能搞定吗
You're sure you can do this?

101
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
是的
Yeah.

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,026
我来吧
I'll do that.

111
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,007
这是干嘛
What the hell, man?

112
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,061
现在连量都不让我来了吗
What, I can't work a scale now?

113
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:38,084
这太他妈扯淡了
This is bullshit.

114
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:40,058
你就直说了吧
Just say it.

115
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:41,088
直说了吧
Just say the words.

116
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,078
-你认为我偷东西  -嘘
- You think I'm stealing. - Shhh.

117
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:01,096
走你自己的路
Walk with who you are.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,006
我以前的赞助者经常这么对我说
That was a phrase my sponsor used to use with me

119
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,077
那还是我刚参加戒毒互助会的时候
back when I first started coming to meetings.

120
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,030
这可能是"做你自己"的另一种说法罢了
It's probably just a different way of saying "Be yourself."

121
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:11,067
对吧
Right?

122
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:16,024
但这个"走"法
But this idea of "Walk"

123
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,071
还告诉我
also tells me

124
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:20,001
生活还将继续
that I have to move forward.

125
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,001
他总是给我有用的忠告
Always good advice, at least for me.

126
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:25,095
我看这里来了些新人
I see we have some new people here at group,

127
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:27,022
新面孔
a couple new faces.

128
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:29,025
举个手
Let's see some hands.

129
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,032
谁是新来的
First time?

130
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,056
好的  欢迎
Great. Welcome.

131
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,020
我们可以轮流自我介绍下
Maybe we can go around, introduce ourselves.

132
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:45,037
想到什么尽管说
Say whatever's on your mind.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,047
从你开始怎么样  可以吗
How about you? You want to start us off?

134
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:55,098
可以  我叫安德里亚
Yeah. My name is Andrea... and, uh...

135
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,035
我们又不会咬人  不会做评判
We don't bite. No judgments.

136
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,052
你可以畅所欲言
You can be as open and honest as you want to be.

137
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,086
老实说  我不想来这
Honestly, I don't want to be here.

138
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,027
好吧  够诚实
All right. Fair enough.

139
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,073
还有谁有话要说
Who else had their hand up?

140
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:25,071
你好
Hey. 'Sup?

141
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:28,001
我是杰西
My name's Jesse.

142
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,088
你好
Why, hello.

143
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,005
我叫布兰登
My name is Brandon.

144
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:35,042
我想这位是彼得吧
And this is, I believe, Peter?

145
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:37,048
没错  我是彼得  你好
Right. I'm Peter. How are you?

146
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,080
知会你们一声
Look, I just wanted to give you a heads up.

147
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,017
偷运毒品的事可能要缓一缓
It's gonna get a little slower smuggling product

148
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,000
臭老头在监视我的一举一动
with Grandpa Anus watching every move I make.

149
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:58,037
别担心  我会搞定的
But don't worry. I'll keep it flowing.

150
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,024
-好的  -很好
- Great. - Right on.

151
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:01,087
那好
Yeah.

152
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:04,024
卖的怎么样
So how's it selling?

153
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:05,071
很好吧
Mad volume?

154
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:09,015
是的  情况...
Yeah. It's, uh...

155
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,088
你知道的...
You know, it's, um...

156
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:13,068
不怎么样
It's not so good.

157
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,036
什么意思
What do you mean?

158
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,056
你卖了多少
How much have you sold?

159
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,096
1.75克
I sold a teenth.

160
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,063
1.75克
One teenth?

161
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,099
就这么点吗
That's it?

162
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,070
是的
Yeah.

163
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:25,070
卖谁了
To who?

164
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,030
他
To him.

165
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,014
听着  卖给这些人可不太容易
Look, it's not so easy selling to these people.

166
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:34,004
他们都是些想改过自新的人
They're here trying to better themselves.

167
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,023
肯定是这样的  就这么回事
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff going on here.

168
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,044
我在外面拼上性命给你们俩搞来毒品
I'm out risking my ass to get product for you two,

169
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:44,031
而你们两个孬种却卖不掉
and you're too pussy to sell?

170
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,035
可怜虫
You're pathetic.

171
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:50,085
把货都给我  全部都给我
You know what? I want it back. All of it.

172
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,059
我自己卖
I'll sell it myself.

173
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:54,011
得了  伙计  别这样
Come on, man. Don't be like that.

174
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,020
卖毒品给这些人
Selling to these people,

175
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,006
就像用枪打婴儿
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

176
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:58,019
太难下手了
It's not natural.

177
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:00,051
没错  杰西  没你想的那么容易
Yeah, Jesse, it's not easy like you think.

178
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:04,078
那我就证明给你们看那有多容易
I'll show you exactly how easy it is.

179
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,078
对不起
Oh, hey. Sorry.

180
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,081
没关系  继续
No. Go ahead.

181
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:29,045
是安德里亚吗
It's Andrea, right?

182
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:31,028
是的
Yeah.

183
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:33,015
你好  我是杰西
Hey, um, my name's Jesse,

184
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:37,048
我也不想呆在这里
and, uh, I don't really want to be here, either.

185
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:44,015
抱歉
Sorry.

186
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,020
玛丽姨妈要来吃晚饭吗
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

187
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,024
她不来
No.

188
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,074
你爸爸要来
Your dad is.

189
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,085
你有什么窍门让她这么快入睡
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

190
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:22,039
是不是因为你很无聊
Are you that boring?

191
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:25,016
我让她感到安逸
I'm comforting.

192
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,053
她觉得在我怀里很安逸
I'm a comforting presence.

193
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,096
睡吧
There we go.

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,010
乖
Shh, shh.

195
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:40,071
看
Hey, so check it out.

196
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,014
什么
Huh?

197
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:44,018
知道这意味着什么吗
See what that means?

198
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:45,095
看看日期
Check out the date.

199
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:48,078
我正式宣布  到下周四
Next Thursday is officially six months

200
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:51,031
我持初学驾照就有半年了
that I have had my learner's,

201
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:54,001
表示我可以领到临时驾照
which means I can get my provisional

202
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,034
可以自己开车了
and start driving by myself.

203
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,085
什么时候的事儿
Since when?

204
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,063
你还有两个月才满十六周岁呢
You don't turn 16 for two more months.

205
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:03,070
这是临时的  年龄无所谓
It doesn't matter. It's a provisional.

206
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,080
查查  法律修改过了  10年前的事了
Look it up. They changed the law, like, 10 years ago.

207
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,087
是吗  我当时可没投赞成票
Oh, yeah? Well, I didn't vote for that.

208
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,050
你投不投票无所谓
Doesn't matter if you voted for it.

209
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:12,067
法律就是法律
It's the law.

210
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,087
所以你俩可以开始想想
So both of you start thinking

211
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,057
打算给我买辆什么样的车了
about what kind of car you want to buy me.

212
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:18,024
要是有老款IROC跑车或者福特野马
I think I'd be good with either

213
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,051
我就满意了
an old IROC or a 'Stang.

214
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:24,005
福特野马啊
Ah, a 'Stang.

215
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:28,019
车轮辐板上有扑克牌的怎么样
How about something with playing cards in the spokes?

216
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:30,076
可以发出嗤嗤声
Makes a nice motor-y sound, you know?

217
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,010
要打发我可没那么容易
Aha, dad. You're not gonna get off that easy.

218
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:41,050
我想这件事...
Well, I-- I think that this is, um--

219
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:45,010
过会儿再来讨论
We should probably table this discussion for later.

220
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,094
你爸爸和我有些事
Your dad and I have a couple things

221
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:48,071
要谈  所以...
we need to talk about, so--

222
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:49,084
好的
Okay.

223
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:55,001
1971年款  340马力  快背设计
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback

224
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:57,038
绿黄色
in Grabber Lime

225
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,092
前盖要带振动系统的
with a shaker hood.

226
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:01,062
福特野马
'Stang.

227
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:03,066
我要写下来免得忘了
I want to write that down so I don't forget.

228
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,016
郁闷  没笔
Oh, darn it. No pencil!

229
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:34,011
北极斑马科考站合作人是怎么回事
What is Ice Station Zebra Associates?

230
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:40,019
是外贷  没问题的
It's a loan-out. It's fine.

231
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:42,052
外贷给谁
Whose loan-out?

232
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:45,019
没事的  真的
It's fine. Really.

233
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:49,066
我有个熟人
I...have a guy.

234
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,050
那
Okay.

235
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:54,053
你的熟人知道
Um, does your guy know

236
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:57,010
新墨西哥州的所得税的法律法规吗
the tax code and regulations in New Mexico?

237
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:59,057
因为这笔钱每季度都要查
'Cause there's very specific paperwork

238
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:01,004
而且还要明细上报
that has to be submitted quarterly on this.

239
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,091
他知道  我这个熟人是个...行家
Yes. My guy is a top...guy.

240
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,030
他是谁
Who is he?

241
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,031
叫什么名字
Uh. What's his name?

242
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:08,088
他够格吗
What are his qualifications?

243
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:09,099
沃尔特
Walt,

244
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:14,026
这笔钱到汉克和玛丽手里时
this money has to be unimpeachable

245
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:17,036
必须是正当的
when it reaches Hank and Marie.

246
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,089
这笔钱是正当的  现在是将来也是
And it is. It will be.

247
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:21,063
可你叫我怎么放心
But how do I know that?

248
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,086
你连这个人的名字都不能告诉我
I mean, apparently, you can't even tell me the man's name.

249
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,090
老天
Oh. Jesus.

250
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:27,070
斯凯勒  你真的想知道吗
Skyler, do you really want to know?

251
00:14:27,073 --> 00:14:29,003
我是说  当真想知道吗
I mean, do you really want to know?

252
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:34,007
真想吗
Really?

253
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:09,013
你们好  欢迎
Hello. Welcome.

254
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:11,003
很荣幸见到你
What a pleasure it is to have you.

255
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:13,034
可以的话  我就叫你斯凯勒了
I'm just gonna call you Skyler, if that's okay.

256
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,080
名字很可爱
It's a lovely name.

257
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:18,027
让我想起晴空万里
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.

258
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:20,014
沃尔特从没告诉过我他有多幸运
Walt never told me how lucky he was--

259
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:23,008
当然  最近发生了点小意外
prior to recent unfortunate events.

260
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:24,071
显然  他选女人
Clearly, his taste in women

261
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:26,048
和选律师是同样的品味
is the same as his taste in lawyers--

262
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,051
只选最好的
only the very best

263
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:32,012
同时也是有点肮脏的
with just the right amount of dirty.

264
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:33,095
开玩笑呢
That's a joke.

265
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,012
开玩笑呢
That's a joke.

266
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:38,092
挺有趣  因为很显然  你的格调很高
It's funny because you are so clearly very classy.

267
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:41,093
来吧  请坐
Here. Please, sit down.

268
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:43,075
沃尔特告诉我
So Walt tells me

269
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,066
我可以帮你消除一些顾虑
that you have some concerns I can alleviate.

270
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,060
是的  我有
Uh, yes, I do. I have...

271
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:52,021
顾虑
concerns.

272
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:55,048
如果我们要继续这么下去
If we're going to go down this road,

273
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:59,021
当然  是为了我的妹夫着想
and clearly we are for the sake of my brother-in-law.

274
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,090
我听说了他的事
I've heard about him.

275
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,080
他是真英雄
He's an American hero.

276
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,017
至少  我需要一些保证
At any rate, I need some assurances

277
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,097
确保我们所办之事是
that we're gonna go about this in a manner

278
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,084
安全谨慎的
that is extremely safe and cautious.

279
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:15,011
可以理解  我来给你梳理一遍程序
Fair enough. I'll walk you through the process.

280
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,035
第一步
First step is something

281
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:19,048
我们把它叫做洗钱
we like to call money laundering, all right?

282
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:23,059
我们拿了你们的钱  就用这些豆粒糖来代表
Take your money, represented by, say, these jelly beans.

283
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,075
-我是会计  -然后...
- You know, I'm a bookkeeper-- - Then I--

284
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,069
所以我知道什么是洗钱
...so I actually know what money laundering is.

285
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:32,056
-好吧  -没错
- Well... - Yeah.

286
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,080
正如大部分事情一样
And, as with most things,

287
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,090
细节决定成败
the devil is in the details.

288
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,023
我首先要知道
So to begin with,

289
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:41,004
这笔钱的来路  我们要怎么说
what are we saying is the source of this money?

290
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,094
这很简单
That's simple.

291
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:45,057
沃尔特编了个很好的故事
Walt here actually came up with a great story

292
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:47,041
说是赌赢的钱
about gambling winnings.

293
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:49,054
21点  对吧  算牌
Blackjack, right? Some card counting?

294
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:52,038
其实  这是斯凯勒的主意
Well, actually, that was Skyler's idea.

295
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,035
好吧
Well,

296
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:57,055
你真是越来越魅力四射了
you grow more gorgeous by the minute.

297
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,059
那么就是这样
Well, there you have it.

298
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:03,083
我会伪造大量的现金转帐记录
I'll generate false currency transaction reports out the wazoo.

299
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:06,070
这与填写赌博所得收入的表格同等重要
as well as the necessary W-2Gs.

300
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:08,098
我认识几个赌场经理
I know a couple casino managers

301
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:11,087
他们会抓住机会上报伪造的亏损
who will jump at the chance to report false losses.

302
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:13,067
这是双赢的局面
It's a win-win for everyone.

303
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,047
是可以这样  但可不是长久之计
Yeah, but you can't sell that for very long.

304
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:18,051
没错  我早想到了
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.

305
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:22,009
我们部分申报纳税到不引起怀疑就够了
We declare just enough so as not to arouse suspicion,

306
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,016
然后沃尔特赢得这笔钱就成了
then Walt's one-time winnings become seed money

307
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,008
一项投资的本钱
for an investment.

308
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,024
投资什么
Investment in what?

309
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:30,047
隆重的时刻到来  听我告诉你
Drum roll please. Wait for it.

310
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,064
激光枪战游戏
Laser tag.

311
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,086
激光枪战游戏
Laser tag.

312
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:38,006
7000平方英尺的游乐场
7,000 square feet of rollicking fun

313
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,060
开在伯纳利欧县北部中心地带
in the heart of northern Bernlillo County.

314
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:43,056
激光枪战游戏
Laser tag?

315
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,060
是啊  枪枝弹药  火光大炮
Yeah. There's guns and glow lights and--

316
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,057
穿着防弹背心的小孩儿
Kids wear the vests,

317
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,064
互相组队...
and they have to split into teams--

318
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,034
我知道那是什么
Right. No, actually, I know what it is.

319
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,004
只是把这与沃尔特联系起来
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's--

320
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:57,041
不太靠谱
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

321
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:59,098
这比说你们俩是一对儿靠谱多了
It makes more sense than you two being together.

322
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:01,099
我始终想不通你俩是怎么走到一起的
I'm still trying to figure out how that happened.

323
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:04,015
你很了解沃尔特吗
Do you even know Walt? I mean...

324
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,086
他怎么可能做起激光枪战游戏这种生意
how would he of all people buy a laser tag business?

325
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,049
和他身份不符
It doesn't add up.

326
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,036
和他身份正合适  沃尔特是科学家
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist.

327
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,006
科学家喜欢激光
Scientists love lasers.

328
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,033
况且还有碰碰船呢
Plus they got bumper boats, so--

329
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:18,000
嘿  大伙儿知道吗
Hey, everybody.

330
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:21,054
沃尔特突然决定投资激光枪战游戏了
Walt suddenly decided to invest in laser tag.

331
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:23,011
纯粹是异想天开
Just out of the blue.

332
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:26,021
像这样吗  我们就这样告诉别人
Really? That's what we're supposed to tell people,

333
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:29,068
我们的家人  朋友  政府
our family, our friends, the government?

334
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:31,018
我来给你明确一下
Let me bottom line this for you.

335
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,068
你不必牵涉其中
You don't need to be involved.

336
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:36,025
因为我干这行已经好多年了
Because I've been doing this for a lot of years--

337
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:38,019
没有你的帮助  我也很成功
successfully, believe it or not--

338
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,083
信不信由你
without your help.

339
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,068
感谢两位前来
So thank you for stopping by.

340
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:03,062
要来瓶啤酒还是别的
You want a beer or something?

341
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,063
别的
Or something.

342
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,060
你有什么别的
What do you mean?

343
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,077
比如啤酒
Like beer.

344
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,064
我戒了毒  没别的了
I'm clean out of anything else.

345
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:20,074
即使我有别的  我们也不该吸
Even if I wasn't, we're not supposed to.

346
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,075
是啊
Yeah.

347
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,092
我听这话已经一遍
I've heard it over

348
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:27,048
一遍
and over

349
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:29,039
又一遍了
and over again.

350
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:34,083
你觉不觉得很荒谬
You know, don't you think it's ridiculous

351
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:38,050
这个社会允许我们喝啤酒
that society says beer is okay

352
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:43,040
来点劲爆的就不行
and a little hit of something sweet is wrong?

353
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,044
我是指
I mean...

354
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:47,091
为什么要忍着不吸那些
what's the point of shutting yourself off completely

355
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:52,008
能让人飘飘欲仙的东西
from something that lifts you off the ground?

356
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:58,055
我花了很大的精力
I spend so much energy

357
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:03,013
压制自己想吸的欲望
fighting the urge not to use,

358
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:05,050
但感觉很糟
and I feel like crap because of it.

359
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:12,037
我知道  只是...
I know. It's just...

360
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,051
什么
What?

361
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:19,028
我不能再被发现复吸
I can't get caught using again.

362
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:29,019
那别被抓住就行了
See, the thing is... not to get caught.

363
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,093
你试过那个蓝色的货吗
You ever try that blue stuff that's going around?

364
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,094
小吸一口
Just a little gas in the tank,

365
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:44,067
一瞬间
and suddenly...

366
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:46,044
一切变得无与伦比
everything is interesting.

367
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,075
我多希望这种感觉可以一直持续下去
Man, I wish I can make that feeling last.

368
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:59,042
我刚说了  这儿什么都没有
Like I said, I got nothing here.

369
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,053
要是我能弄点儿来呢
What if I could get some?

370
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,017
妈咪  妈咪
Mommy! Mommy!

371
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:15,047
嘿  小布
Hey, B!

372
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:18,064
奶奶早早儿把你领回来了
Oh, your nana brought you home early.

373
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:23,058
奶奶  我以为今天布鲁克去你那儿
Grandma, I thought you were keeping Brock today.

374
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:26,081
是的  但我看见你的车
I was. Then I saw your car.

375
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,055
你不是去戒毒互助会了吗
I thought you had a meeting.

376
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:31,002
对  改时间了
I did, but we changed the time.

377
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:33,025
外婆  这是杰西
Grandma, this is Jesse.

378
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,065
互助会的成员
He's from the meeting.

379
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,052
算是发起者
He's like a sponsor.

380
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:38,059
杰西  这是外婆
Jesse, this is Grandma.

381
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:56,053
杰西  这是布鲁克
Jesse, this is Brock.

382
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,044
这么说  你...
So, you, uh...

383
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,057
你有孩子
You have a kid, huh?

384
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:03,087
你好吗
What's up?

385
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,011
布鲁克是吗
Brock, huh?

386
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:08,084
这名字真酷
That's a cool name.

387
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,018
来  击掌
Here. Give it up.

388
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:25,049
布鲁克快满6岁了
Brock is almost 6.

389
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,089
你不讨厌孩子吧
You okay with kids?

390
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:30,036
啥  不  他挺好的
What? Yeah, he's cool.

391
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:34,046
好  我们大人说话
Okay, Brock is gonna go play in his room

392
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,046
布鲁克回房间去玩
while the big people talk.

393
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:39,039
去玩乐高积木和小汽车
He's gonna go play with his Legos and his cars

394
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:41,036
-说"杰西再见"  -杰西再见
- Say "Bye, Jesse." - Bye, Jesse.

395
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,049
我所要求的  不过是谨慎安全
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,

396
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:59,009
那个人却完全不靠谱
and that man is neither.

397
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:02,049
我承认  他看起来就像个小丑
I'll admit, he comes across like a circus clown.

398
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:05,072
但他知道自己在做什么
But he actually knows what he's doing.

399
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:07,059
你完全不要牵连进来
Safe and cautious is you

400
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:09,052
这才是谨慎安全
not being involved in this at all.

401
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,022
那可有点来不及了
Well, it's a little late on that.

402
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:13,068
你用制毒赚的钱付家里账单开始
This is what happens when you decide

403
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:14,090
我已是共犯
to pay our bills with drug money.

404
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:25,018
斯凯勒  这事涉及的不止是之前的事情
Skyler, this isn't just about what happened before.

405
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:32,011
我现在正越陷越深
My involvement in this is ongoing.

406
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:35,041
你明白吗
Understand?

407
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:39,005
没有回头路可走了
I can't just quit.

408
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:44,061
我签了某种算得上合同的东西
I have something of a contract.

409
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:49,045
非常安全  专业  组织严密
It's all very safe and professional and structured.

410
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:52,005
我不可能轻易脱身
I can't simply quit.

411
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,061
你往哪儿开
Where are you going?

412
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,057
沃尔特  如果你一定要洗钱
If you're gonna launder money, Walt,

413
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:24,035
至少得选对方式
at least do it right.

414
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,002
洗车场

415
00:24:44,002 --> 00:24:46,068
你在这里工作过4年
You worked here four years.

416
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:48,049
了解这个行业
It's a business you understand.

417
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:50,045
人们会相信
It's a story people will believe.

418
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:53,076
激光枪战不靠谱  这个靠谱
Not laser tag. This.

419
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,070
这才是我们该买的
This is what we buy.

420
00:24:57,027 --> 00:24:58,027
你
You.

421
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,090
这才是你该买的
This is what you buy.

422
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:35,080
杰西是吧
Hey, uh, Jesse, right?

423
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,030
布兰登  彼得
Brandon. Peter.

424
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,093
最近怎么样  混得还成
How goes it? Hanging in there?

425
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:43,007
得了省省吧  蠢猪
Please, just... Dumb ass.

426
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,071
不好意思伙计  我是想打打掩护
Sorry, man. I was trying to keep it on the DL.

427
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:51,005
你和那个妞  搞成了吗
So you and that girl, you do the deed yet?

428
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,085
搞什么
Do what?

429
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:56,068
你知道的  就是把货卖给她
You know, sell to her.

430
00:25:58,062 --> 00:26:00,035
你们两个跑来干嘛
What are you two even doing here?

431
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:03,039
什么意思
What do you mean?

432
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:06,049
既然你们没本事把货卖出去
You can't get your nut up to sell.

433
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:07,099
还跑来干嘛
What's the point of even coming?

434
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:10,083
老兄  我已经进行到第五步了
Homie, I'm on, like, step 5.

435
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:12,013
我也是
Deuce, yo.

436
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:13,023
我正迎头赶上呢
I'm catching up.

437
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:21,007
随你们便吧
Whatever.

438
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:22,044
回见
Later.

439
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:29,088
哥们得赶紧了
Dude needs to come into the fold.

440
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:33,032
就是
Yep.

441
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:36,082
知道吗
Oh, you know what,

442
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:39,025
我可有超能力哦
I have magical powers.

443
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:40,029
要不要看
You want to see?

444
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:44,009
准备好了吗
Ready?

445
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,090
不是真的
That's not real.

446
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:50,047
是真的
It is real.

447
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,041
你要看真的吗
All right, do you want to see something that's real?

448
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,014
看这个  瞧仔细了
Look at this. Watch this.

449
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:56,065
准备好了
Ready?

450
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:04,069
喜欢吗
You like that?

451
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:07,076
这叫科学  科学规律使然
That's science and stuff. Makes it do that.

452
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:10,096
再来一次
Do it again.

453
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,013
让杰西吃饭吧  布鲁克
Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.

454
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:13,013
没关系
It's okay.

455
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,023
没关系
It's okay.

456
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:15,066
要再看一遍吗
Want to see it again?

457
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,072
你会用鞭炮变戏法吗
Could you do a trick with firecrackers?

458
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:20,001
鞭炮
Firecrackers.

459
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:24,046
这个  我身上没带鞭炮
You know, I don't have any firecrackers on me.

460
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:25,076
谁会用鞭炮变戏法
Who does tricks with firecrackers?

461
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,026
托马斯
Tomás

462
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,088
托马斯会用鞭炮变戏法
Tomás does tricks with firecrackers, huh?

463
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:32,002
托马斯是谁
Who's Tomás?

464
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,032
我家小弟
He's my kid brother.

465
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:35,025
是嘛
Yeah?

466
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,065
我们不怎么提他
And we don't talk about him.

467
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:40,056
乖  吃饭吧  布鲁克
Come on. Eat your food, Brock.

468
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:44,070
我可以吃根薯条吗
Can I have a chip?

469
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:46,023
我要偷你的薯条了
I'm gonna steal your chip.

470
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:47,083
嘿  那是我的
Hey, that's mine.

471
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,037
就这个吗  这就是你要买的产业
That's it? That's what you want to buy?

472
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:54,014
这个至少比较可信
People will believe it at least.

473
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:57,061
我在这里工作过4年
I worked here for four years.

474
00:27:57,064 --> 00:27:59,088
打蜡  去蜡  这是你干的吗
Wax on, wax off. Was that you?

475
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:03,041
为什么你们总给车里喷空气清新剂呢
Hey, how come you guys always get with the air freshener, huh?

476
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,079
我特地嘱咐说不要喷空气清新剂
I explicitly say I want no air freshener,

477
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:07,012
每次来取车的时候
and every time I drive away

478
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:09,016
车里都香得跟妓院似的
smelling like an Alpine whore house.

479
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:14,026
无意冒犯  我看不出哪里好  所以不行
All due respect, I don't see it. So I vote, I vote no.

480
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,060
比你那激光枪战靠谱一些
Makes a better story than your laser tag.

481
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:20,023
这是你的意思还是你家那位的主意
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

482
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:22,056
她说的有道理
She has a point.

483
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,020
我投资这里更说得通
It makes more sense that I invest right here.

484
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:29,037
说得好像她洗了很多年的钱一样
Based on her years of experience in money laundering, I suppose.

485
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,007
我告诉你吧
Let me tell you something.

486
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,050
只要功夫深  什么故事都能真
If you're committed enough, you can make any story work.

487
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:36,037
我曾让一个女人相信我就是凯文·科斯纳
I once convinced a woman that I was Kevin Costner.

488
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:36,037
著名的演员 导演兼制片人

489
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:39,036
诀窍就是自己要深信不疑
And it worked because I believed it.

490
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:42,003
跟故事好不好没关系
It has nothing to do with the story.

491
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:44,080
另外  这破地方压根不成
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work

492
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:46,020
因为这里没有丹尼
because it doesn't have a Danny.

493
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,074
懂吗  这里没有丹尼
Okay? There's no Danny here.

494
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:51,087
这个他妈的丹尼是谁
What in God's name is a Danny?

495
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:54,044
丹尼是激光枪战游乐场的老板
Danny runs the laser tag.

496
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:56,085
他是个眼光独特的人
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

497
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:58,035
别人只看到一堆破烂
Where others saw a dirt lot,

498
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:01,045
他却能看到黑光灯  塑胶外星人
he saw black lights, rubber aliens,

499
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:03,085
青少年拿着激光枪跑来跑去  懂吗
teenagers running around with ray guns, right?

500
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:06,026
就像沙漠里的毕斯·西格尔[美国黑帮老大]
It was like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.

501
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:09,079
股票崩盘以后  丹尼有麻烦了
And when the stock market took a shit and Danny got into trouble,

502
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:12,034
他就开始寻找我们这种
he went searching for exactly the type of situation

503
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,070
合作伙伴
that we're offering.

504
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:17,083
丹尼是懂得变通  从而实现梦想的人
Danny will look the other way to keep his dream afloat.

505
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:21,014
换句话说  丹尼完全可以信任
In other words, Danny can be trusted completely.

506
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:25,037
那家伙  看眉毛就是个直肠子
That guy... the guy with the eyebrows that won't quit...

507
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,051
能做丹尼吗
is he a Danny?

508
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:29,034
你买下这地方
You buy this place,

509
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,001
就是一幢会喷水的大楼
all you got is a big building that squirts water.

510
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:34,052
这里没有丹尼
You got no Danny here.

511
00:29:46,096 --> 00:29:49,006
想留下吃晚饭吗
You want to stay for dinner?

512
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,013
想
Yeah.

513
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,040
谢谢
Thanks.

514
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,000
几点了
What time is it?

515
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:58,031
还早呢
Early still.

516
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:03,068
那么
So...

517
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:09,042
什么
What?

518
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:11,039
我在想
I thought maybe,

519
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,099
如果你不走的话
if you're holding,

520
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:14,089
我们或许可以做点什么
we can do something.

521
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,033
做什么
What?

522
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:22,033
就是  之前你提到的蓝色的那货
You know, that blue stuff you were talking about?

523
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,060
或许你手头有点
Maybe you had a line on some.

524
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:28,010
等等  你说什么
Wait. Whoa. What?

525
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,037
你不是说孩子快回来了吗
I thought you said the kid is coming home.

526
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,041
没错  不是还有几个小时吗
Yeah, in a few hours.

527
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:37,061
所以你真的想嗑药
And you seriously want to get high?

528
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:41,011
我不明白你为什么这样生气
I don't know what you're getting so pissed about.

529
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:43,058
那天是你先提起来的
You're the one who brought it up the other day.

530
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:46,045
的确  但那是我知道你有孩子之前的事
Yeah, that was before I found out you got a kid.

531
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:49,039
你算哪门子母亲
What kind of mother are you?

532
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:51,066
什么
What?

533
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:53,033
你听见了  孩子要你照顾  你却嗑药鬼混
You heard me. What kind of mom gets wasted

534
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:54,096
你算哪门子母亲
with a little kid to take care of?

535
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:02,057
谁也没资格说我没好好照顾我儿子
Nobody can say I don't take care of my son.

536
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,044
你还跑我家来批判我吗
You gonna come in my house and judge me?

537
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:06,054
你是不是觉得你自己无牵无挂
Like you got no responsibility,

538
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,011
所以可以随便嗑药
so it's okay for you to get high.

539
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:09,068
-听着  我  -你了解我多少
- Look, I... - What do you know about me?

540
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:11,021
我的孩子  我知道照顾
I take care of my baby.

541
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:12,051
我愿意为他做任何事情
I'll do anything for him.

542
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:17,005
布鲁克出生的那天  我发过誓
The day Brock was born, I swore...

543
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:20,009
绝不会让我儿子重蹈托马斯的覆辙
I won't let what happened to Tomás happen to my son.

544
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,015
除非我死
I'll die first.

545
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:26,009
对不起  我...
Sorry. I...

546
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,019
我只是
I just...

547
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,010
如果你想我离开  我马上就走
Look, I'll get out of here if you want.

548
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:39,010
你要想走  那就走吧
That's what you want to do, then go.

549
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:41,010
我不想走
It's not what I want.

550
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:45,041
听着  我的话太过分了
Look, I was out of line talking about that stuff.

551
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:58,042
我俩都有错
We both were.

552
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:03,052
你说得对
You're right.

553
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:07,009
我不知道你经历过什么
I don't know what you've been through.

554
00:32:07,013 --> 00:32:09,013
如果你愿意  可以告诉我
Yo can tell me if you want.

555
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,054
整个街坊都被黑帮控制着
This whole neighborhood is run by gangs.

556
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:19,065
他们贩毒  控制街道
They run the drugs, control the streets.

557
00:32:22,082 --> 00:32:25,022
他们把托马斯拉进去了
And they sort of took Tomás in.

558
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:34,017
托马斯当时8岁  没父亲看管  跟他们学坏了
No dad around. 8 years old, they got Tomás slinging.

559
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:37,030
加入了某个帮派
Part of some crew.

560
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:43,007
到他十岁的时候
Then, when he was 10...

561
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,098
为了什么入会仪式
for some initiation or something...

562
00:32:48,085 --> 00:32:50,038
要他去杀个人
they made him kill somebody.

563
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,029
我一开始听到传言并不相信
I heard the rumors. I didn't believe it at first.

564
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:01,093
但一个礼拜后我遇到他
But then I saw him, like, a week later.

565
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:08,067
他告诉我传言是真的
He told me, yeah, he did it.

566
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,060
他们给了他把枪
They gave Tomás a gun.

567
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,084
让他选
Gave him a choice.

568
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,064
自杀还是杀别人
Him or some dude.

569
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:22,028
所以他选择杀别人
So he did it.

570
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:26,025
他说得轻描淡写的
Told me all about it like it was nothing.

571
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:30,049
他有说他杀了谁吗
Who did he say he killed?

572
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:38,009
一个其他组织的毒贩吧
Some dealer...from some outside crew.

573
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:40,063
就在那边的街角
Right around the corner from here,

574
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:42,057
中心再过去一点的地方
over off the Central.

575
00:33:45,037 --> 00:33:48,070
他就骑着他的脚踏车然后开枪杀了他
Just rode up on his bike and shot him.

576
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:54,038
中心再过去一点吗
Off the Central?

577
00:33:56,028 --> 00:33:58,088
你是说铁轨那边吗
Like, over by the train tracks?

578
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:02,065
什么时候的事
When was this?

579
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,005
几个月前吧
A few months back.

580
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:12,049
他还说什么了
What else did he tell you?

581
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:20,027
他开枪射穿了那人的脖子
He shot the guy right through the neck.

582
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,047
那人当场就死了
Shot him dead.

583
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:29,068
就因为他在别人的地盘贩毒
Just because he was working the wrong corner.

584
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:40,099
这种事绝不能再在我儿子身上发生
It won't happen again. Not to my son.

585
00:34:58,082 --> 00:35:00,015
你猜怎样
Guess what.

586
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:03,059
当人们说"猜"的时候
People who say "Guess what"

587
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:06,023
他们确实想要你去猜
and then actually expect you to guess--

588
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:08,016
我讨厌这种人
I hate those people.

589
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,006
好吧  我刚听说
Well, I just heard

590
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,093
一个叫做汉克·施拉德的病人
about a certain patient named Schrader-comma-Hank

591
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:17,097
这周末就可以出院了
who is going to be released at the end of this week.

592
00:35:19,014 --> 00:35:20,084
开心吗
Isn't that fantastic?

593
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:25,011
他们终于打算让我出院了
Are they planning on rolling me out the front door at least,

594
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:27,005
是不是打算在窗户边架个木板
or they'll put me on a greased plank

595
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:28,085
好让我滑下去
and, uh, slide me out the window?

596
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,072
听着  我才不管
Listen, I don't care

597
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:34,002
那些该死的保险公司说什么
what any damned insurance company thinks.

598
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,059
我痊愈之前绝不离开这里
I'm not leaving here until I'm well.

599
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:39,019
汉克  这不关保险的事儿
Hank, this isn't about insurance.

600
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:41,040
我和医生们都谈过了
I've talked to everybody, and they all say

601
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:43,047
他们都说你复原得不错  可以回家了
that you are healthy enough to go home.

602
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,030
我康复的不错  是吗
Oh, I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.

603
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:47,040
汉克  你的状况一天比一天好了
Hank, you get stronger every day.

604
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,064
不需要再待在医院里了
You don't need to be in a hospital.

605
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:53,011
就现在这状况  我宁愿待在医院里
In this condition, yeah, I do.

606
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:56,021
你回家会跟在这里一样舒服的
You'll be just as comfortable at home as you are here.

607
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:57,095
这儿有的设备家里都有...
You'll have all the same equipment--

608
00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:59,072
家里都有  什么意思
All the same equipment? What--

609
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:01,015
-所以你在这  -你的意思是
- The equipment-- ...- Does that mean?

610
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,045
你用得到的东西  家里都有
...that you have here that you need.

611
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:03,095
只是暂时的
Short term.

612
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:06,042
你可以在家做体能训练
You'll do your PT at home,

613
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:10,006
这很好  不是吗  毕竟在家里
and it'll be great because you'll be home.

614
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,040
还有卧室
Wait till you see the bedroom.

615
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:14,003
我叫他们把等离子电视也搬过来了
I had them move the plasma in.

616
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,033
我知道你一直想要那东西
I know that's how you always wanted it,

617
00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:18,080
所以你才故意中枪来医院的  对吧
and you only had to get shot to get it, right?

618
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:21,001
我还给你买了张新床
I got you a new bed.

619
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,047
病床吗
A hospital bed?

620
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:24,044
是啊
Well--

621
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,028
你在我卧室里放了张病床吗
You put a hospital bed in my bedroom?

622
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:31,001
汉克  这样你就能回家了
Hank, you'll be home.

623
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:34,005
你给我把那东西扔掉
You get that out of my house.

624
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:36,032
听到了吗  玛丽
You hear me, Marie?

625
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,096
今天就扔掉
Today.

626
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,086
汉克
Hank--

627
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:41,059
等我能走的时候
I leave this hospital

628
00:36:41,063 --> 00:36:45,016
我才出院  你明白了吗
when I walk out of here, you understand?

629
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:48,053
在此之前  绝对不走
And not before.

630
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,097
丹尼是什么人
What's a Danny?

631
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:58,041
丹尼是帮我们洗钱的人
Danny is an accomplice, someone who's in on the scheme,

632
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,091
他知道怎么洗钱
who knows about laundering,

633
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:04,071
我们付钱给他  帮我们另谋出路洗钱
who's paid to look the other way.

634
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:06,038
虽然我同意你的说法
Now, while I agree with you

635
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,092
激光枪战游乐场的确不是好主意
that laser tag is a hard sell,

636
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,049
但如果没那人帮忙
without a Danny,

637
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:12,073
洗车场的事也是做不成的
the car wash isn't really an option.

638
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:16,023
他没法再给你找个丹尼
And he can't get you another Danny

639
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,093
来打理洗车场吗
to run the car wash?

640
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:19,097
说起来简单
Easier said than done,

641
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,050
但想找个可信的人是很难的
if we're looking for someone trustworthy.

642
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:38,005
我怎么样
What about me?

643
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,089
什么你怎么样
What about you?

644
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:45,032
我来
Me.

645
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,043
我来帮你洗钱
I'll be the Danny.

646
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:52,007
不  不  斯凯勒  这不是个好主意
No. No. No, Skyler. That is not a good idea.

647
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,054
我完全有能力来管理这种小生意
I'm perfectly capable of managing a small business.

648
00:37:54,057 --> 00:37:56,061
那也得是合法生意  不是这种生意
A legal business, not this.

649
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:58,001
那我们还能相信谁
Who else could we trust?

650
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:00,024
-不行  -沃尔特
- No. - Walt.

651
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,008
我已经被牵扯进来了
I'm in this.

652
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:05,025
所以我来做  就可以万无一失了
And if I'm in it, I'm going to do it right.

653
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:07,075
你没有  这和你无关
You are not in this. You are not--

654
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:09,049
咱俩是夫妻  怎么会无关
We're married. How am I not in this?

655
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:12,009
我们不是夫妻  斯凯勒  我们离婚了
We are not married, Skyler. We're divorced.

656
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:22,080
对吗
Right?

657
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:30,065
其实我还没来得及提交离婚协议书
I never actually got around to filing the papers.

658
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:38,095
夫妻不能被强迫出庭指证对方的
Married couples can't be compelled to testify against one another.

659
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:42,095
所以就这么定了
So there's that.

660
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,095
杰西
Jesse!

661
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:11,064
杰西
Jesse.

662
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:14,008
戴上防毒面具
Respirator.

663
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,061
好吧
Right.

664
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:39,012
喂
Yes?

665
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,049
好的
Yes.

666
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,082
好
Okay.

667
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:52,099
我会去的
I'll be there.

668
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:57,052
什么事
What was that?

669
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:01,016
他邀请我去他家
An invitation.

670
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:23,018
你来得正是时候
Ah. Walter. You're right on time.

671
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,005
请进
Please, come in.

672
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:36,066
希望你喜欢海鲜汤锅[西]
I hope you like paila marina.

673
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:38,086
这是炖鱼比较好听的叫法
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

674
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:42,013
听来很老套
It sounds like a cliché,

675
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:44,097
但我母亲过去常常做这道菜
but indeed, it's just like my mother used to make it.

676
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:52,091
来吧  给我打下手
Come on. You can help me cook.

677
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:58,007
这是智利菜
This is a Chilean dish

678
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:00,003
我很喜欢
that I love,

679
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:03,025
但一直没机会做
but I never get to make it.

680
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:05,059
因为孩子们不喜欢吃
The kids won't eat it.

681
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,072
但是
But, uh...

682
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,093
你明白的
you know how that is.

683
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,043
当然
Sure.

684
00:41:16,093 --> 00:41:19,007
来帮个忙怎样
Do you mind?

685
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,050
把大蒜切一下
Would you slice the garlic?

686
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,097
切薄一点
Very thin.

687
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:36,032
你邀我来所为何事
Why did you invite me here?

688
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:40,032
我们是生意伙伴
We're working together.

689
00:41:40,036 --> 00:41:42,096
一起吃顿饭很正常吧
Why not break bread together?

690
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:47,000
切大蒜吧
Now the garlic.

691
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:06,088
人的感官与回忆之间的联系
It always amazes me the way the senses work

692
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:08,048
太神奇了
in connection to memory.

693
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:12,018
我是说  炖鱼只是一锅大杂烩
I mean, this stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients.

694
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:13,024
如果把材料分开的话
Taken separately,

695
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:15,068
不会让我回忆起任何事
these ingredients alone don't remind me of anything.

696
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:18,032
基本上不会
Not very much at all.

697
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:22,009
但一旦按这样混合起来
But, in this precise combination,

698
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:25,012
这味道就立即
the smell of this meal instantly--

699
00:42:25,016 --> 00:42:27,053
让我想起了我的童年时光
it brings me back to my childhood.

700
00:42:27,056 --> 00:42:28,089
真是太奇妙了
How is that possible?

701
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:32,050
大体上说  这过程发生在大脑的海马区
Basically, it all takes place in the hippocampus.

702
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:38,017
形成了神经连接
Neural connections are formed.

703
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,018
外界感应让神经中枢发出信号
The senses make the neurons express signals

704
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:48,061
信号传送到了大脑的之前的同一个地方
that go right back to the same part of the brain as before,

705
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,005
那个地方储存着人的记忆
where memory is stored.

706
