1
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:04,045
在我出生的小镇上
In the little village where I was born,

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,045
人们过着悠闲的生活
life moved at a slower pace...

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,019
不过富翁都喜欢这样的生活
yet felt all the richer for it.

4
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:16,005
在那里  我的两个叔叔因为厨艺精湛
There, my two uncles were known far and wide

5
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,046
而声名远扬
for their delicious cooking.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,089
他们只用最新鲜的药草和香料
They seasoned their zesty chicken

7
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:23,050
给他们的美味炸鸡调味
using only the freshest herbs and spices.

8
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:28,094
人们将他们称之为"炸鸡兄弟"
People called them "Los Pollos Hermanos"--the Chicken Brothers.

9
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:32,079
如今  我们传承叔叔们的手艺
Today, we carry on their tradition in a manner

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,091
并将之发扬光大
that would make my uncles proud.

11
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:38,085
精心的调制加上最完美的原料
The finest ingredients are brought together with loving care...

12
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:42,029
再慢慢烹炸到完美
then slow-cooked to perfection.

13
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:45,058
没错  在洛博罗炸鸡馆
Yes, the old ways are still best

14
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,009
祖传秘方依然是王道
at Los Pollos Hermanos.

15
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:49,076
不过不要光听我说
But don't take my word for it.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,083
来尝一口  你便会知道
One taste and you'll know.

17
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:37,020
绝

18
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:37,020
命

19
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:37,020
毒

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:37,020
师

21
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:37,020
第三季

22
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:37,020
第九集

23
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,088
201.6磅
201.6.

24
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,038
老天  真是的
Jesus, seriously.

25
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,062
超标总比未达标强
Better over than under.

26
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:53,012
超了一磅半啊
Over by a pound and a half.

27
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,089
我以为你是个讲究精确的人呢
I thought you were all, like, precise.

28
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:56,071
无所谓了
Whatever.

29
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:58,039
我们把多余的弄出来保存到下周好了
We'll just save it out till next week.

30
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:01,019
别动了  就将就这样运出去
No. We ship it as-is.

31
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,033
当我们做慈善事业的吗
What are we, running a charity?

32
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:04,090
我们要把多余的取出来
we're gonna take it out.

33
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,097
别动了
Leave it.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,020
一批货  一次出
One batch, one ship.

35
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,010
别把事情复杂化了
Stop complicating things.

36
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:20,028
你为什么要故意给他免费的冰毒
Why are you purposely giving him free meth?

37
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:23,078
这群贱人已经压榨我们够多的了
These bitches are bleeding us enough already.

38
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:26,069
你的酬金已经很多了
You are paid extraordinarily well.

39
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,082
-你为什么就不能满足呢  -的确是
- Why can't you just appreciate that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.

40
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:31,002
但我一直都在算账
Hey, I've been crunching numbers, all right?

41
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:32,023
你一直在算账吗
Oh, you've been crunching numbers?

42
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,063
对  我一直在算账
Yeah, I've been crunching numbers,

43
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:36,009
我不是数学家都算得清这笔账
and I don't gotta be a mathematician to figure out

44
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,000
你亏大了
that this deal you made is bullshit.

45
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:39,023
我们都赚到了
We both earn--

46
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:40,073
是  是啊  我知道
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know...

47
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:43,030
每人一百五十万
a million and a half each.

48
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,014
哇哦
Whoop-de-doo.

49
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,054
他得到了什么
What's he getting?

50
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,068
他以4万每磅的价格批发
Say he's wholesaling at 40 large a pound.

51
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:54,031
这个价可能是有些高了
That's probably high.

52
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,068
你觉得我们的货卖这个价高了吗
High. Uh, what, for our stuff?

53
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,092
那价钱还只是据我所知
That's what I was getting.

54
00:03:57,095 --> 00:04:00,035
好吧  听着  就算1磅要4万
All right, look, say he's getting 40 a pound.

55
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,066
好吗  3个月  每周200磅
All right? 200 pounds a week for three months.

56
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,003
3个月下来会怎样
And, like, what happens at the end of the three months?

57
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:07,096
听着  明白吗
Look, what-- whatever.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,006
3个月  每周两百磅
200 pounds a week for three months.

59
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,083
那可是2400磅啊
That's 2400 pounds.

60
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:14,020
2400乘以4万可就是
2400 times 40,000 is--

61
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:17,034
我发誓  我已经算了不下十遍了
and I swear to God, I double-checked this, like, 10 times--

62
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:18,081
9600万美元
96 million dollars.

63
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:23,058
9600万美元啊
96 million dollars.

64
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:26,068
对吧  是9600万美元
All right? 96 million.

65
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:29,038
9600万才给我们300万
96 to our three.

66
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:33,022
简直糟糕透顶
That is messed up, yo. That is so messed up.

67
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,099
老实说  我都无法
Fairness-wise, I can't even--

68
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:39,056
杰西  你现在已经是百万富翁了
Jesse, you are now a millionaire,

69
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:42,056
你却还在抱怨
and you're complaining?

70
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,040
你以为你活在怎样的世界里
What world do you live in?

71
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:48,022
活在一个干了活  没有得到
One where the dudes who are actually doing all the work

72
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,030
应有酬劳的世界
ain't getting fisted.

73
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:52,057
你最近是怎么了
What is going on with you lately?

74
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:54,091
到底是怎么了
What's happened to you?

75
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,058
等下  我们就不能...
Hang on, can't we just--

76
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:00,058
我们得好好谈谈
Hey, we got to hash this out.

77
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:03,085
还有什么比钱更重要的吗
Hey, what's more important than money?

78
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:10,052
这种东西也好意思叫枕头
These things they laughingly call pillows,

79
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:13,053
就是给犯人用都嫌烂
I would not give them to prison inmates.

80
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:15,053
你想要我去再给你要一个吗
You want me to go ask for another?

81
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:18,006
不用了  记得提醒我从家里把他的带来就行了
No. Just remind me to bring his from home.

82
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:22,087
他们该多让他的腿活动活动
They're not moving his legs enough.

83
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,090
大家好
Hey, everybody.

84
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:29,008
你好  玛丽
Hi, Marie.

85
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:33,051
我能来看看他吗
Is it okay if-- if I visit?

86
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,070
恩
Yeah.

87
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,021
他气色不错
His color looks good.

88
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:57,019
格米  是你吗
Gomie, is that you?

89
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:59,036
老兄  是的  是我
Hey, buddy. Yeah, it's me.

90
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,032
真是你吗  格米
That's you, Gomie?

91
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:05,063
是的  汉克  我就在这
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

92
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:08,003
过来  靠近点
Come here. Closer.

93
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:11,030
怎么了
What is it?

94
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,094
靠近些
Closer.

95
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,027
混蛋
Asshole.

96
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,065
老兄  他把你给耍了
Man, he got you good.

97
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:24,098
是啊
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:27,092
我很高兴  你他妈还有幽默感
I'm glad to see you still have your twisted sense of humor.

99
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:31,053
老天
God.

100
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,099
看看这个
Hey, check this out.

101
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:41,066
我拿了点能让你心情好点的东西
I got something that'll make you feel better.

102
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,000
我一直在留意你的蓝色冰毒案
I've been keeping an eye on that blue meth of yours.

103
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,037
6-7周  没一点反应
Six, seven weeks, nothing.

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,020
然后突然间  到处都是
Then all of a sudden, boom. It's popping up everywhere.

105
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,044
看看新的地点
Look at the new locations.

106
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:53,041
德克萨斯  内华达
Texas, Nevada,

107
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,008
上面的法明顿
up in Farmington.

108
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:56,068
甚至在这儿
Even right here in town.

109
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:58,087
你知道吗  各地青少年已经
A teener here and there, you know,

110
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:00,032
完全是在街头交易了
strictly street-level amounts.

111
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,018
太疯狂了
Man, it's crazy.

112
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:06,022
你觉得我听了这个会心情好点吗
How exactly is that supposed to make me feel better?

113
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,026
因为你是对的
Because you were right.

114
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,059
你是唯一一个预料到这情况的人
You're the only one that saw this coming.

115
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,026
好吧  为我欢呼三声吧
Well, three cheers for me.

116
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,027
这东西他妈不起作用
This thing doesn't do a damned thing.

117
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,027
汉克  那个可能还在锁定状态
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.

118
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,047
已经过了一个小时了  对吗
It's been an hour, right?

119
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:26,008
我这里很疼  我该吃点药了
I'm hurting here. I could use some meds.

120
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,094
好吧  我去给你找个医生过来
Okay. I'll go find somebody.

121
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,045
不许再说工作的事了
Hey, no more shop talk.

122
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,015
对不起
Sorry.

123
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,029
我没有预料到这一幕
I didn't see it coming.

124
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:42,039
什么
What?

125
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:44,063
你当然预料到了
Damn right you did.

126
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,076
没有  我什么都没料到
No, I didn't see shit.

127
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,030
总是差那么一点
Day late and a dollar short, as usual.

128
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:59,031
我之所以还活着是因为
The only reason I'm... even breathing...

129
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:01,064
我接到了一个警告电话
is I got a warning call.

130
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:06,025
警告电话  你什么意思
A warning call? What do you mean?

131
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:10,085
在他们袭击我的前一分钟
One minute before they attacked me,

132
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,026
有人打我手机告诉我要小心
somebody called my cell and told me to expect it.

133
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,059
用的话音加扰器  我听不出是谁
A voice scrambler. It could have been anybody.

134
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:20,093
玛丽把我的手机收起来了
Marie's got my phone somewhere,

135
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:23,093
如果你想要查那个来电的话
if you want to run the incoming.

136
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:27,000
应该得不到什么有价值的线索
Not that you're going to learn anything worth knowing.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,051
我不明白  贩毒集团火拼
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

138
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:31,094
谁会打电话警告你呢
Who would have called to warn you?

139
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:34,064
我不知道
I don't know.

140
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,098
老天
Aw, Jesus.

141
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:40,035
不会吧  太痛了
Come on already.

142
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,022
坚持住
Hang on.

143
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:25,003
斯凯勒  这事与我无关
Skyler, I had nothing to do--

144
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:32,047
我们安全吗
Are we safe?

145
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:36,064
是的
Yes.

146
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:48,065
你安全吗
Are you safe?

147
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:53,062
当然
Absolutely.

148
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:22,025
杰西
Jesse?

149
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:26,079
杰西
Jesse?

150
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:29,012
你怎么样
What about you?

151
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:31,079
气色好多了
Face looks better.

152
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,021
一切进展如何
How's it all going?

153
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:34,073
想和我们聊聊吗
Anything you want to tell us about?

154
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:40,047
聊什么  我的趣味人生吗
What, like my interesting life?

155
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,014
混吃等死罢了
One day pretty much bleeds into the next.

156
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:48,081
我有工作了  很忙
Been working a lot. I got a job.

157
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,098
有工作是好事
Job is good.

158
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:52,065
在一家自助洗衣店
It's in a laundromat.

159
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,088
连锁集团性质的
It's totally corporate.

160
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,048
连锁自助洗衣店
Corporate laundromat.

161
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:57,079
感觉就是压抑  各种条条框框
It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.

162
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:01,076
我老板是个混球  店主是个大混球
My boss is a dick. The owner? Super dick.

163
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,049
我都没见过店主  不够资格还是怎么的
I'm not worthy or whatever to meet him,

164
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,043
可我看得出来大家都怕他
but I guess everybody's scared of the dude.

165
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:07,076
店里都是些翻着死鱼眼的草包
The place is full of dead-eyed douche-bags,

166
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,096
工作时间超长
the hours suck,

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,083
没人清楚到底怎么回事
and nobody knows what's going on,

168
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,043
就这样
so...

169
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:15,034
听起来有点卡夫卡风格[压抑得让人做噩梦]
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

170
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:19,011
没错
Yeah.

171
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,014
完全的卡夫卡风格
Totally Kafkaesque.

172
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:26,015
绝对的
Majorly.

173
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:31,012
圣达菲的联邦检察长送的
Ooh, from the U.S. Attorney in Santa Fe.

174
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:33,026
真好
Very nice.

175
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,013
还有漂亮的郁金香和满天星
We've got all these nice tulips and baby's breath.

176
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:40,080
这是菊花吧  看起来像菊花
This is chrysanthemum. That looks like chrysanthemum.

177
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,080
汉克你看  多漂亮呀
Look at these Hank. Aren't they beautiful?

178
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,000
漂亮
Beautiful.

179
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,097
这个果篮好大个
Wow, look at the size of this basket.

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,047
里面好多吃的
It's got so many goodies in it.

181
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,014
看哪  巧克力脆皮饼干
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels

182
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:52,024
干酪条
and cheese sticks

183
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:55,014
还有风味橄榄
and some some fancy designer olives.

184
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:56,048
他不能吃干酪条
You had me at cheese sticks.

185
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,098
打赢我才给你吃  汉克
Mmm, you're going to have to fight me for those, Hank.

186
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:01,042
"泰德·贝内克携贝内克公司全体员工"
"Get well, and best wishes from Ted Beneke

187
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:04,025
"祝您早日康复"
and all the folks at Beneke Fabricators."

188
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,076
他准你这么长时间的假  还送东西
Wow, he gives you all this time off, and now this?

189
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,092
我也要去给他工作
Get me a job there.

190
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:10,043
我知道  他人超好
I know. He's great.

191
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,073
老板名人堂
Boss hall of fame.

192
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:13,093
我可没看见这里有克兰曼送的东西
I don't see anything here from Kleinman.

193
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:15,076
他们办事得有效率点才行
They're going to have to get on the stick.

194
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:19,043
今天感觉如何
How's everybody doing today?

195
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:20,074
很好  我们好极了
Good. We're good.

196
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:21,094
你呢
How are you?

197
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:23,077
我很好
I'm very good.

198
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:25,027
汉克
Hi, Hank.

199
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,078
做个小反应测验好吗
Just going to do a quick peripheral response, all right?

200
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,091
确认下康复程度
See where we're at.

201
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:31,011
关键时刻到了吗
Moment of truth, huh?

202
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,098
恩  可我不会这么叫
Yeah. I wouldn't call it that.

203
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,012
好了 我们开始吧
All right, let's just take a look here.

204
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:40,046
好
All right.

205
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,092
有感觉的话告诉我
All right, I want you to tell me if you can feel this.

206
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,083
这里呢
How about this?

207
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,047
好吧
Okay.

208
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:59,084
现在呢
How about now?

209
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:03,011
再划一下好吗
Do that one again, would you?

210
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,008
这里吗
Right there?

211
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,008
恩  我感觉到了  刺痛
Yeah, yeah, I feel it. A tingle.

212
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:10,072
好了  1到10级表示
Okay, on a scale of one to ten,

213
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:12,042
10表示你正常的触觉
ten being your normal level of feeling

214
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,096
1表示毫无感觉
and one bein no feeling at all.

215
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:16,083
说不好
Oh, I don't know.

216
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,009
4级
A four?

217
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:20,076
好了  4级  不错
Okay, four. Okay.

218
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,010
这里呢
And how about there?

219
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,044
有感觉  6级
Yeah. Um, a six.

220
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,057
好  很好
Okay, good.

221
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:32,091
这呢
And here?

222
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:38,011
有感觉  不那么明显
Yeah, still there. A little less.

223
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,055
-3级  -好
- A three. - Okay.

224
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:41,095
很好
All right, good.

225
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:44,042
谢谢配合  汉克  很好  非常好
Thank you very much, Hank. Good, good.

226
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:47,076
这算是好消息  对吧
So this is good news, right?

227
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,072
对  绝对是好消息
Oh, yeah, definitely.

228
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:54,096
看起来神经机能已经开始恢复了
It looks like some nerve function is returning.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,010
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

230
00:13:57,013 --> 00:14:00,014
好吧  他什么时候可以走路
All right, so when do we get him walking again?

231
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:10,074
玛丽  要达到预期固然很重要
Marie, it's important that we manage our expectations.

232
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:14,038
但即便是是数月的艰苦努力
We're talking about months of very hard work,

233
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:17,049
成功的几率也不是很大
and even then the odds, they're not great.

234
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:19,072
但你也不能确定
But you can't know for sure.

235
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:20,089
不能
No.

236
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,059
他什么时候开始理疗
When does he start physical therapy?

237
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:26,039
文件已经发到你的保险公司  优先处理
We've sent the paperwork to your insurance. It's high priority.

238
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:29,006
再过几天我们应该可以得到预授权
We should have pre-authorization the next few days.

239
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,007
最迟下周初
Certainly by early next week.

240
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,050
下周
Next week?

241
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:35,014
不行  太迟了
No, that's not going to do it.

242
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:37,057
我查过资料
I've looked into this.

243
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:39,031
理疗开始越早
The sooner physical therapy begins,

244
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:41,008
他康复的希望就越大
the better his chances are.

245
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,004
他需要每日理疗
He needs daily sessions.

246
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,025
不是吗
Isn't that right?

247
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,065
事实上
Well... Actually,

248
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,018
你们的健康计划治疗方案包含一项
your plan's treatment program

249
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:49,008
每周四次的理疗
covers four sessions a week.

250
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:53,076
事实上  她问的是医生
Actually, she asked the doctor.

251
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:58,043
每周四次是比较典型而且明智的计划
Plan-wise, four sessions a week is fairly typical.

252
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:01,066
你们的定点理疗师大部分还是不错的
And the therapists in your network are mostly fine.

253
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,063
大部分还不错  好吧  简直是太令人振奋了
Mostly fine? Okay. There's a ringing endorsement.

254
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:10,004
我想知道  如果能有更好的理疗师
Look, if Hank had more physical therapy,

255
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:12,004
做更多的理疗
with better therapists,

256
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:15,038
汉克能站起来的希望会更大的吧
wouldn't it be more likely he would walk?

257
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:20,048
玛丽  这种事情很难说
It's very hard to say, Marie.

258
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:25,005
健康计划治疗方案医学上完全可信
Is the health plan's way medically justifiable? Sure.

259
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,039
至于是不是最好...
Is it absolutely optimal?

260
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:30,073
别说了  管他妈的
You know, screw it.

261
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:32,056
我要先保证他得到最好的治疗
I'm going to make sure he gets what he needs,

262
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,020
赔偿的事以后再说
and they can just reimburse me later.

263
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:37,040
施拉德夫人  我非常理解你的感受
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration. Really, I do.

264
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:40,074
但我的建议是您最好不要脱离体系
But my best advice is stay in the network.

265
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,000
不要计划外开支
Don't go out of pocket.

266
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:44,041
理疗只是一个开始
Physical therapy is just the beginning.

267
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:48,008
你们还要请人护理  对家居设施进行改造
We're talking nursing care, modifications to your home,

268
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:50,075
进行职业疗法  购买医疗仪器
occupational therapy, medical equipment.

269
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,042
费用可能高达几十万美金
It could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

270
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,008
那又怎样
So what?

271
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:58,042
你要我们在汉克的医护选择上妥协吗
We're just supposed to compromise on his care?

272
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:02,002
如果不遵照保险公司的规定就医
Well, if you don't follow the insurance company's procedures,

273
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:03,066
你们可能永远都拿不到赔偿
they may never pay you back.

274
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,069
我见过病人和家属徒劳等待赔偿金
I've seen patients and their families go bankrupt,

275
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:08,003
直到破产
waiting to be reimbursed.

276
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:11,033
你知道的最好的理疗师叫什么
Who is the best physical therapist that you know?

277
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,070
我可以为你引荐几位
I can give you some names.

278
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:16,004
但他们不太可能在健康计划中
But they're not likely to be on your plan.

279
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,044
让健康计划见鬼去吧
To hell with the plan.

280
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,089
他来了
Yeah, there he is.

281
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:40,046
你终于来了  我没等你先开始了
Finally. I went ahead and started without you.

282
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,070
姑娘们  这位是杰西君  给他来个全套
Ladies, this is Jesse-san. He's in for the full treatment.

283
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:47,040
把鞋脱了  躺下  去去角质
Kick off your shoes. Lay back. Exfoliate.

284
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,044
以后再说吧
Maybe later.

285
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:49,057
大师人呢
So, where's the maestro?

286
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:51,007
在外面停车吗
Was he out parking the mini-van?

287
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,037
怎么  我是他的跟屁虫吗
What do I look like, his shadow?

288
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,058
谁管他在哪儿呢
Who cares where he's at?

289
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:55,024
叫我来干什么
What am I doing here?

290
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:58,008
我本来想叫你俩一起来决定的
Well, I was going to have you two flip a coin,

291
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:02,022
既然大天才不肯赏脸
but since the genius can't be bothered,

292
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,002
你就走运了
today's your lucky day.

293
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,042
四下看看  小子  都是你的了
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

294
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:10,096
什么  这店吗
What? This?

295
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:15,003
没错  你现在是这家店的主人了
Yeah. You are now the owner of this fine establishment.

296
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:16,036
不要钱吗
For free?

297
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,003
不要钱  女士们快捂上耳朵
Free? Ladies, cover your ears.

298
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:21,030
不  哪能不要钱
No, not free.

299
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:23,071
听我说  这是一家信誉良好
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,

300
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:26,037
盈利甚丰  至少是有潜力的
highly profitable-- at least potentially...

301
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,084
的本地机构
local institution,

302
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:31,021
很被商会以及商改局看好
looked upon with favor by the Chamber of Commerce. Better Business Bureau.

303
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:34,038
只要你31.2万  比抢还合算
At $312,000, it's a steal.

304
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,072
31.2万
312,000?

305
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:38,039
还没明白吗
Don't you get it?

306
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:40,059
外面看  这是一家美甲沙龙
On the outside, it's a nail salon, right?

307
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:45,046
里面看  就是你小子的洗钱圣地
On the inside, it's the best money laundry a growing boy could ask for.

308
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:48,080
等等  别走
Wait, wait.

309
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,077
等等
Wait.

310
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,040
女士们  谢谢  干得不错
Ladies, thank you. Thank you. Good job.

311
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,070
回来说话
Come back here.

312
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:56,024
坐下  回来
Sit. Come on.

313
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,034
容我解释一下
Humor me here for a second.

314
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,094
你明白你的钱是需要洗的  对吧
Now, you know you need to launder your money, right?

315
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:05,075
你明白个中原理的吧
Do you understand the basics of it?

316
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:07,095
我帮你安排  弄个幌子  洗钱之类
Placement, layering, integration?

317
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:11,002
我不会买什么美甲沙龙  算了吧
I ain't buying no damn nail salon, so just forget it.

318
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:12,095
所以你想蹲号子是吗
You want to stay out of jail, don't you?

319
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,069
你不想留着那些钱并逍遥快活吗
You want to keep your money and your freedom.

320
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:17,036
送你几个字
Because I got three little letters for you.

321
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,069
美国国税局[Internal Revenue Service]
IRS.

322
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:21,000
如果他们能逮到卡蓬[美国黑手党老大]  就能抓到你
If they can get Capone, they can get you.

323
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:24,003
看好了  假设这是你
Hey, look. Here's you, right?

324
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,070
粉红的  平克曼  对吧
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

325
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:27,070
这是你的钱
Okay, here's your cash.

326
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:30,037
你在城外  在派对狂欢
You're out on the town. You're partying hearty.

327
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,037
跟辣妹们打得火热
You're knocking boots with the chickie babes.

328
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,074
看谁来了  税务局的
Oh, who's this? It's the tax man.

329
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:37,071
他注视着你
And he's looking at you.

330
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,005
他看到了什么
What does he see?

331
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:41,072
他看到一个年轻人  住着豪宅
He sees a young fellow with a big, fancy house,

332
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:44,072
钱财万贯  却没工作
unlimited cash supply, and no job.

333
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:47,092
他会从中得出什么结论
Now what is the conclusion the tax man makes?

334
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:49,072
我是个毒贩子
I'm a drug dealer.

335
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:51,026
错
Wrong.

336
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,006
错得离谱
Million times worse.

337
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,006
结论是  你逃税漏税
You're a tax cheat.

338
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,057
他们会怎么做  拿走每分钱
What do they do? They take every penny,

339
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,074
而你因为逃税去坐牢
and you go in the can for felony tax evasion.

340
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:03,054
知道错在哪吗
Ouch. What was your mistake?

341
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:06,011
错在你没洗钱
You didn't launder your money.

342
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:08,001
现在  把钱交给我
Now, you give me your money.

343
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:10,001
此为安排部署
That's called placement.

344
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:12,021
把那个小罐子递给我
Hand me that little thing bin.

345
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,028
假设这是美甲店
This is the nail salon, right?

346
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:18,002
我用你的赃款
I take your dirty money

347
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:22,042
用作美甲店运营的合法流动资金
and I slip it into the salon's nice, clean cash flow.

348
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:24,069
此为掩人耳目
That's called layering.

349
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:25,089
最后一着  洗钱完毕
Final step, integration.

350
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:29,026
美甲店的收入就流进老板的口袋
The revenues from the salon go to the owner.

351
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,003
也就是你  你那肮脏的毒品交易赃款
That's you. Your filthy drug money has been transformed

352
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:36,004
就变的合法了  还是税后所得
into nice, clean, taxable income,

353
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:40,021
通过理性投资  你的"事业"将蒸蒸日上
brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business.

354
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:46,005
所以你想要我买下这地方来交税
So you want me to buy this place so I can pay taxes.

355
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:47,032
我可是个罪犯
I'm a criminal, yo.

356
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:53,005
没错  可如果你想犯罪而不被逮
Yeah, and if you want to stay a criminal and not become, say, a convict,

357
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,006
那你得成熟点听取你律师的建议
then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.

358
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:00,009
是啊  这样你就能拿到那5%的钱了
Right, so you can get your 5%.

359
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,040
不  是17%
No, that's 17%.

360
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:03,040
我记得你说的是5
I heard you say 5.

361
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:05,007
当着我面说的
You said it right in front of me.

362
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,040
没错  不过是对你搭档说的
Yeah. That was for your partner.

363
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:08,024
资历较深者有优惠
It's privileges of seniority and all.

364
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:12,011
但你  跟以前一样  17%  已经很便宜了
But for you, it's the usual. 17%, and that's a bargain.

365
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:14,001
怎么了  你...  听着...
Hey, what, you-- Hey, listen to--

366
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,008
别这样  我在跟你谈你的将来
Come on, I'm talking to you about your future here.

367
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:19,018
要听从劝告呀
Listen to reason.

368
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,079
你连襟情况如何
How is your brother-in-law?

369
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,040
死不了
He'll live.

370
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:10,006
很好  我很高兴
Good. I'm glad.

371
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,034
沃尔特  你看上去很困惑
Walter, you seem troubled.

372
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:18,004
有什么能为你效劳吗
How can I help you?

373
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:24,088
我来见你是想...
I asked to see you in order to...

374
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:28,025
澄清事实
clear the air.

375
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:32,039
有些事
There are some issues

376
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,069
可能会引起我们之间的误会
that could cause a misunderstanding between us,

377
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:42,090
最明智的做法就是  打开天窗说亮话
and I think it's in our best interest to lay the cards on the table.

378
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:46,057
这样合作才是王道
That's the best way to do business.

379
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,074
我的连襟
My brother-in-law,

380
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:54,008
在他遇袭前
moments before he was attacked--

381
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:56,008
有人打电话警告他
someone called to warn him.

382
00:21:57,068 --> 00:22:01,075
我想那位仁兄应该也在保护着我吧
I believe that same person was protecting me.

383
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:11,006
那两个杀手  想要杀的人该是我吧
Those two men, the assassins-- I believe I was their prime target,

384
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:14,050
出于某些原因  他们转移了目标
but that somehow they were steered away from me

385
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:16,060
去杀我的连襟
to my brother-in-law.

386
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:26,094
多亏了他  我才能活下来
Because of this intervention, I am alive.

387
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:34,088
而且我认为此仁兄的计划并不那么简单
And yet I think that this person was playing a much deeper game.

388
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:41,036
他打那通电话是希望双方交火
He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout,

389
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,056
而不是简单的暗杀
not a silent assassination.

390
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:49,063
一石二鸟  两败俱伤
In one stroke he bloodied both sides,

391
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:55,000
让墨美政府共同打击贩毒集团
set the American and Mexican governments against the cartel,

392
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:58,094
切断西南地区的冰毒供应
and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

393
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:05,068
如果这人在国境的这边
If this man had his own source of product

394
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:07,092
有自己的产品生产渠道
on this side of the border...

395
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:12,052
那市场就全归他了
he would have the market to himself.

396
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,089
而利润将是...暴利
The rewards would be...enormous.

397
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:30,087
大家都是成年人
We're both adults.

398
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:33,057
我不可能装作不知道  你就是那位仁兄
I can't pretend I don't know that person is you.

399
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:42,025
这是毫无疑问的
I want there to be no confusion.

400
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:46,012
我知道我的命是你给的
I know I owe you my life.

401
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:57,000
而且我敬重你的谋略
And more than that, I respect the strategy.

402
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:04,004
换做是我  我也会这么做
In your position, I wouldn've done the same.

403
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:15,065
有件事一直困扰着我
One issue which troubles me--

404
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:23,012
我们三个月合同到期以后  我将何去何从
I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends.

405
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:27,029
你想何去何从
What would you like to happen?

406
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:31,000
你知道我为什么入伙
You know why I do this.

407
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:36,014
我要保证家人的安全
I want security for my family.

408
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,084
我答应你
Then you have it.

409
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,054
3个月  300万
Three million for three months.

410
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:41,021
这是我们的协议
That was our agreement.

411
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:46,098
延长一年就是  1200万
Extended annually, twelve million a year.

412
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:49,012
一共就是1500万
Call it fifteen.

413
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:51,029
随时可供修改
Open-ended.

414
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,025
可以接受吗
Would that be agreeable?

415
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:40,012
之所以要谈论那些我们
Part of the reason we talk about what gets us riled up

416
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,035
生活中的不堪往事
in our daily lives,

417
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,095
是为了告诫所有人
is to help each other put a finger

418
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:46,086
不要再犯同样的错误
on what our relapse triggers might be,

419
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:49,036
将那些恶习扼杀在摇篮里
head off our disease before it comes back.

420
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,063
谁有话要说吗
So... anyone?

421
00:26:56,024 --> 00:26:58,004
随便怎么抱怨都行
Free license to bitch and moan.

422
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,074
这机会可不是每天都有的
How often do you get that?

423
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,001
杰西  上次你说洗衣店的工作
Jesse, last time you seemed pretty down

424
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:05,064
让你情绪低落
about your job at the Laundromat.

425
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:06,078
我想问你
Let me ask you something.

426
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:09,055
如果有机会做你喜欢做的事
If you had the chance to do anything you wanted,

427
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,092
你想做什么
what would you do?

428
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:14,072
赚钱  赚很多很多钱
Make more green, man, a lot more.

429
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:16,099
先不谈钱  假设你什么都有了
Forget about money. Assume you have all you want.

430
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:25,083
我也不知道
I don't know.

431
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:30,053
可能我会做点东西
I guess I would make something.

432
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:32,020
比如
Like what?

433
00:27:35,024 --> 00:27:37,071
不是什么重要的东西  但是...
Not that it even matters, but...

434
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:41,091
手工制作  我想
work with my hands, I guess.

435
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:44,088
建筑一类吗  就像...
Building things, like...

436
00:27:44,092 --> 00:27:47,089
木工  或者砌砖之类的吗
carpentry or brick laying or something?

437
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:51,072
高中时候我上过职业技术课
I took this vo-tech class in high school,

438
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:53,097
木材加工
wood working.

439
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:55,006
我上过很多这样的课
I took a lot of vo-tech classes

440
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,013
一堆垃圾
because it was just a big jerk off,

441
00:27:57,016 --> 00:28:00,067
但有一次  我遇到一位老师
but this one time I had this teacher

442
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:06,064
好像叫... 派克老师
name of, uh... Mr. Pike.

443
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,024
我猜他年轻时
I guess he was, like, a Marine

444
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,061
可能是海军陆战队之类的
or something before he got old.

445
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:14,038
他有点耳背
He was hard of hearing.

446
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:22,052
我在他课上的作业是做一个木盒子
My project for his class was to make this wooden box,

447
00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:27,012
就是个小的...
you know, like a small--

448
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:28,093
就是个...盒子
just like a-- like a box,

449
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:31,030
可以放东西的
you know, to put stuff in.

450
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:34,050
我只想几下做完了事
So I wanted to get the thing done just as fast as possible.

451
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:38,014
这学期剩下的课就可以全翘了
I figured I could cut classes for the rest of the semester,

452
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:44,031
只要我做了东西  他就不能给我不及格
and he couldn't flunk me as long as I, you know, made the thing.

453
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:45,098
所以几天我就做好了
So I finished it in a couple days.

454
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:50,005
它看上去很烂
It looked pretty lame,

455
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,078
但还能用
but it worked,

456
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:54,009
可以用来随便放点什么东西
you know, for putting stuff in or whatnot.

457
00:28:55,082 --> 00:29:02,029
我把它拿给派克老师看  给我打成绩
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike for my grade,

458
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,097
他看着它说
he looked at it and said,

459
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,014
你就只有这种程度吗
"Is that the best you can do?"

460
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:13,020
一开始我想
At first I thought to myself,

461
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:14,050
废话  贱人
"Hell, yeah, bitch.

462
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,067
给老子个D  然后闭嘴
"Now give me a D and shut up

463
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:19,034
我就可以去和弟兄们嗑药去了
so I can go blaze one with my boys."

464
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:19,034
这里借代上面的D 不是指成绩 指的是Drug 毒品

465
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:25,058
我也说不清
I don't know.

466
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:29,032
也许是因为他说话的方式
Maybe it was the way he said it, but...

467
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:30,052
就好比
it was, like, he w--

468
00:29:30,055 --> 00:29:31,092
他并没有说那东西做的烂透了
he wasn't exactly saying it sucked.

469
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:35,016
他只是在很真诚地问我
He was just asking me honestly,

470
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:38,023
"你真的就只有这种能耐吗"
"Is that all you got?"

471
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:42,046
出于某些原因  我也寻思着
And for some reason I thought to myself,

472
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,050
我当然可以做的更好
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"

473
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:47,054
所以我开始重做
so I started from scratch.

474
00:29:47,057 --> 00:29:50,064
做了一个又一个
I made another, then another,

475
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:51,077
到学期末
and by the end of the semester,

476
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,098
我一共做了有5个盒子
by, like, box number five,

477
00:29:55,001 --> 00:30:00,015
你们真该看看我做的那盒子
I had built this thing. You should've seen it.

478
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:01,088
我当时肯定是疯了
It was insane.

479
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:08,096
居然用秘鲁胡桃木来做外壳  镶的是斑木
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian Walnut with inlaid Zebrawood.

480
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:11,016
用钉子钉一起的  没用螺丝
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

481
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,096
我用砂纸磨了几天  直到磨得像玻璃一样光滑
I sanded it for days until it was smooth as glass.

482
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,040
然后我又用桐油来磨
Then I rubbed all the wood

483
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:21,014
所以盒子看上去色泽深暗且浓艳
with tung oil so it was rich and dark.

484
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:22,097
还散发出特有的香味
It even smelled good.

485
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,047
把鼻子贴近去闻  吸一口那香气
You know, you put nose in it and breathed in,

486
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:32,048
简直堪称完美
it was-- It was perfect.

487
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:34,065
那盒子后来怎么样了
What happened to the box?

488
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:41,042
我把盒子给了我妈妈
I, um-- I gave it to my mom.

489
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:45,096
很不错
Nice.

490
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:48,006
你知道我要说什么  对吧
You know what I'm going to say, don't you?

491
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,043
亡羊补牢  为时不晚
It's never too late.

492
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:54,074
大学里有开设艺术合作社的课程
They have art co-ops that offer classes,

493
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:57,074
还有成人拓展教育项目
adult extension program at the university.

494
00:30:57,077 --> 00:31:00,071
其实我并没把盒子给我妈妈
You know, I didn't give the box to my mom.

495
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:06,031
而是用盒子换了1盎司大麻
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

496
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:17,097
他是英雄  总不能拒绝给英雄付保险吧
He's a hero. You don't deny coverage to a hero.

497
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,084
他们会说他们不是在拒绝付保险
They'll say they're not denying coverage.

498
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:21,044
不不  这点上我是完全赞同你的
No, no, I'm agreeing with you,

499
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,075
但我和沃尔特是经历过的
but I went through all this with Walt.

500
00:31:24,078 --> 00:31:27,075
会花光你所有的积蓄  然后怎么办
You'll burn through your savings, and then what?

501
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:29,085
你们不是也熬过来了吗
Well, you two managed, right?

502
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:31,039
你自己也说了
You said yourself

503
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:34,096
格雷琴他们的钱  也没能支付所有的开销
that Elliot and Gretchen's money didn't cover everything.

504
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:37,093
天  我得回去了
Jesus, I've got to get back.

505
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:40,040
什么  别啊
What? No.

506
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:42,000
别回去  你该休息一下
No, no, no, you should rest.

507
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:45,010
你进去好好洗个澡如何
Look, why don't you go in and take a long bath

508
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:46,080
我在床上放了些干净的床单
I put some fresh sheets on the bed.

509
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:48,084
万一他醒了  我想待在他身边
I want to be there in case he wakes up.

510
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,087
他们给他用的药  够他睡到早上
With all they're giving him, he'll sleep till morning.

511
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:55,078
嗨  斯凯
Hey, Sky.

512
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:59,058
你来这干嘛呢
Wha-- What are you doing here?

513
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:00,065
我顺便过来看看
Well, I just thought I'd stop by

514
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:01,085
来看看你还好吗
to see how you're holding up.

515
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:03,052
时机不对吗  还是...
Is this a bad time, or...

516
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,092
你好
Um-- Hi.

517
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,039
你好
Hi.

518
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:09,096
玛丽  这位是泰德  我的老板
Uh, Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

519
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,036
你就是泰德
Oh, you're Ted.

520
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,020
常听他们说起你
I've heard so much about you.

521
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:15,083
谢谢你送来的礼品篮
Thank you for your gift basket.

522
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:17,040
真的很周到
That was really thoughtful.

523
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,077
真的很体贴  谢谢  泰德
It was. It was really nice. Thank you, Ted.

524
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,010
-是干酪条吧  -恩  干酪条
- Cheese sticks. - Cheese sticks.

525
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:21,034
不客气
Well, you're welcome.

526
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:23,024
你也知道我很关心斯凯勒
You know, we care about Skyler so much

527
00:32:23,027 --> 00:32:25,094
也就自然而然地关心一下她的家人
that naturally that extends to the whole family.

528
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:28,078
你要进屋吗
Are you coming in?

529
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,065
当然  你该进屋坐坐
Oh, yeah, you should.

530
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:34,038
-不好意思  进来吧  谢谢  -好的
- I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted. Thanks. - Okay.

531
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:37,089
我们刚正在喝酒  你要来一杯吗
We were just having some wine. Would you like a glass?

532
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:39,022
不了  谢谢
No. No, thanks.

533
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:41,006
我刚正在回家的路上
I'm just on my way home.

534
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:42,039
我只是想...
I just thought I'd--

535
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:47,000
我真的筋疲力尽了  我得去洗个澡
You know, I--I am really beat. I think I'm going to take that bath.

536
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:48,063
很高兴见到你  泰德
It was nice to meet you, Ted,

537
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:50,010
再次感谢
and thank you again.

538
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:52,023
我也很高兴见到你  玛丽
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.

539
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:53,064
请代我问候一下你丈夫
Please give my best wishes to your husband.

540
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:56,007
我会的
I will.

541
00:32:59,088 --> 00:33:02,008
谢谢你能过来看我
Thanks for stopping by,

542
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:04,075
不过事实上有点...
but it's actually not a--

543
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:06,065
时机不太合适  所以...
not the best time for a visit, so--

544
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:10,045
我们能谈谈吗
Can we just talk for a minute?

545
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:12,042
我理解你得和家人待在一起
I know you need to be with your family,

546
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:16,079
不过我已经几天没你的音讯了
but I haven't heard from you in days

547
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,023
-我留了言...  -我很抱歉
- I left messages-- - I'm so sorry.

548
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,066
你给我放了假  我真的应该...
You gave me all that time off, and I really should've--

549
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,080
我要说的不是这个
That's not my point.

550
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,097
我很关心你  就是这样
I-- I care about you. That's all.

551
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,007
泰德  我...
Ted, I--

552
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,094
汉克出的这档子事
It's just this whole thing with Hank

553
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:30,014
我们还惊魂未定
has been one non-stop horror show,

554
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:32,024
所以你也知道...
you know, so...

555
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:35,041
我只是想让你知道
Well, I-- I just want you to know

556
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:36,095
我是一直支持你的
that I'm here for you.

557
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:39,072
谢谢
Thank you.

558
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:44,052
但我真的需要你去...
Um, but I really do need you to...

559
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,029
好吧
Okay. Okay?

560
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,083
斯凯尔  你妹妹看到我来这...
Skyler, I've got to say your sister seeing me here--

561
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:55,020
我是说
I mean--

562
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:57,033
那又怎样
So what?

563
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,097
我离婚了  你也离婚了  怎么样了嘛
I'm divorced. You're divorced. So what?

564
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,077
我们迟些时候再说这个  好吗  泰德
Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted, okay?

565
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,037
能告诉我为什么要保密的理由吗
Is there some reason for secrecy I'm not getting?

566
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,087
-因为  -迟些再说  泰德  现在不合适
- Because-- - Later. Ted, not now.

567
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:06,038
斯凯勒  你只需要告诉我...
Skyler, just tell me--

568
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,038
你非要这样是不是
You really want to do this now?

569
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,095
你非要逼我立刻作决定是吗
Are you really going to make me do this right now?

570
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,046
你说得没错
Yeah, you're right.

571
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:21,092
-我...  -我真不该来
- I'm-- - Bad idea to come here.

572
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:26,003
泰德  我...
Ted, I'm--

573
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,060
我们过后再谈吧
I'll see you in a day or two.

574
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:31,080
办公室里谈
Back at the office.

575
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,037
随你所愿吧
Take as much time as you want.

576
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:46,052
难以置信  你竟然把房车碾碎了
I can't believe you had to crush the RV.

577
00:34:46,055 --> 00:34:49,059
肯定相当郁闷
Must've been, like... depressing.

578
00:34:49,062 --> 00:34:52,042
说真的  那损失的确很大
For real. That's a stone loss.

579
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:55,009
没人能比我更怀念房车
No one misses it more than me.

580
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:57,043
随时随地  想制毒就制毒
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

581
00:34:57,046 --> 00:35:00,006
没有定额  也没老板
No quotas, no one to answer to.

582
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,056
搞这种东西都搞出责任来了
What's the point of being an outlaw

583
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,070
还算哪门子罪犯
when you've got responsibilities?

584
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:08,020
达斯·维德[星战黑武士]也有责任
Darth Vader had responsibilities.

585
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,017
他对死星有责任
He was responsible for the Death Star.

586
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:12,037
一点也没错  那两个大贱人
True that. Two of them bitches.

587
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,025
我只是说说而已  故意唱唱反调
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

588
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:19,035
我现在还得交税了吗  这他妈搞什么啊
I've got to pay taxes now? What the hell's up with that?

589
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:21,068
完全糟糕透顶  简直压抑得让人做噩梦
That's messed up, yo. That's Kafkaesque.

590
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:26,019
-比去教堂还压抑  -没错
- Church. - Right.

591
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:29,086
我们重新来过
Let's kick it back into gear.

592
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,069
东山再起吧
Let's start slinging again.

593
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:37,030
开工吧
Let's do it.

594
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:38,077
人生苦短  这可是我一直说的
Life's too short. That's what I say.

595
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,097
是啊  哥几个  我们才不需要房车
Hell, yeah, bitches. We don't need no RV.

596
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,047
我们只需要自行车
All we need is a bicycle,

597
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:44,027
一点通乐  还要点苏打
some Drano, soda bottles,

598
00:35:44,031 --> 00:35:45,041
不行  绝对不行
Nah, nah, nah, no shake 'n bake.

599
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:46,094
拜托  你的自尊哪去了
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

600
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:48,041
也许是不太风光
Yo, maybe it ain't top shelf,

601
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:50,001
但至少比没有强吧
but we could at least move it.

602
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:51,058
还是可以小搞一把
Still kind of dry out there.

603
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,075
我们可以上街卖
Let's-- It'll sell on the street.

604
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:55,008
谁告诉你我们要上街卖
Who says we sell on the street?

605
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:57,075
我也许找到了一个全新的市场
Maybe I know a whole new market.

606
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,086
也许我们只需要冰毒就够了
Maybe all we need is the meth.

607
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:37,036
产量多少
What's the yield?

608
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,017
产量  快点
The yield. Come on.

609
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,020
201.8磅
Uh... 201.8.

610
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,047
202.1磅

611
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:07,085
我发现了几张新面孔
I see a couple new faces.

612
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:09,085
有谁想做自我介绍吗
Anybody want to introduce themselves?

613
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:13,095
一个一个来
Don't all speak at once.

614
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,003
你先
Yeah.

615
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,062
我叫布兰登
So my name's Brandon.

616
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,003
好的  布兰登
Okay, Brandon.

617
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:31,095
你想和大家聊聊你自己吗
You want to tell us something about yourself?

618
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:36,012
好吧  我之所以来这
Well, why I'm here--

619
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:39,050
只有一个原因
it's just one thing.

620
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,010
因为冰毒
It's meth.

621
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,004
冰毒是噩梦
It's bad.

622
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:49,061
我曾经戒过几次
Thought I had it kicked a couple times, you know,

623
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:53,084
但是  天啊
but then... Jesus.

624
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:57,055
结果街上又流了新品种
This new version of it hit the streets and...

625
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:01,069
不会是蓝色的那种吧
Not that blue stuff.

626
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:04,042
抱歉  我忘了举手
Oh, sorry, I didn't raise my hand.

627
00:38:04,046 --> 00:38:06,052
没关系  来这里就是为了交流
No, go ahead. This is what we do.

628
00:38:06,056 --> 00:38:08,012
没错  就是蓝色那种
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

629
00:38:10,006 --> 00:38:11,023
你也试过吗
You had it too

630
00:38:11,026 --> 00:38:12,080
是啊  老兄
Yeah, bro.

631
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,023
多希望我从来没碰过那玩意
I wish I never even heard of it.

632
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:18,023
那玩意真是太够劲了
It was like lighting my whole head on fire.

633
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:21,019
是啊  简直让你欲罢不能
Yeah, stuff will burn you down.

634
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:23,047
唯一觉得我还有希望的就是
Only reason I have a hope in hell

635
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,011
那东西后来消失了
is because it's long gone.

636
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:28,042
为你感到羞耻
That's the shame of it.

637
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:31,022
别这么说  老兄
Nah, come on, man. Don't tell me that.

638
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:33,049
我听说那东西又回来了
I hear it's back in town.

639
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:40,007
坚持住  哥们儿  坚持住
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

640
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,090
一切都会好的
It's gonna be okay.

641
00:38:56,025 --> 00:39:00,009
我发誓  我要把这事儿告诉媒体
I swear to God, I'll do it. I will go to the press.

642
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:03,009
48小时也好  夜间新闻也好
I will go to 48 Hours. I will go to Nightline.

643
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,022
不过没关系
is a Nightline anymore. It doesn't matter.

644
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:07,083
他们一定会报道出来的
They will all take it, and they will run with it

645
00:39:07,086 --> 00:39:09,036
因为他是个英雄
because he is a hero,

646
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,043
英雄不会在43岁时就坐上轮椅
and he is not going to be in a wheelchair at 43.

647
00:39:16,017 --> 00:39:18,004
天啊
Jesus.

648
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:25,004
玛丽  我知道斯凯勒应该和你说过了
Marie, I know Skyler's already told you this,

649
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:29,005
如果你需要帮助的话
but if there's every anything that you need,

650
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:30,028
任何需要
anything at all...

651
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:36,089
能有你们两个真好
It's good to have you here. Both of you.

652
00:39:36,092 --> 00:39:40,056
我只希望能尽量为你做点什么
I just wish there was... something more that we could do.

653
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:50,004
沃尔特
Walt?

654
00:39:52,037 --> 00:39:54,024
我们可以帮他们付钱
We can always pay their bills.

655
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,044
拜托  那可要好几万
Please, it's tens of thousands of dollars.

656
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:02,035
我们有钱  绰绰有余
We have the money, more than enough.

657
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:04,075
-沃尔特挣来的  -斯凯勒
- Walt earned it. - Skyler.

658
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:06,042
我觉得不该瞒着玛丽
I think Marie should know the truth.

659
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:10,042
斯凯勒  我不这么认为
Skyler, I really don't think this is a good idea.

660
00:40:10,046 --> 00:40:12,039
-我认为  -他赌博赢来的
- I think that-- - He earned it gambling.

661
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:21,003
沃尔特和我
Walt and I, uh--

662
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:23,040
我们最近有点矛盾  你也知道的
We've had our problems lately. You know that.

663
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:34,088
其实归根结底  就是一个钱字
And, uh... what it all came down to really was... money.

664
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:36,085
就这么简单
Pure and simple.

665
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:39,022
当沃尔特他被诊断出癌症时
When Walt was diagnosed, it, um--

666
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:42,075
整个人都变了
It changed him.

667
00:40:44,072 --> 00:40:47,083
现在回想起来  我仍然无法理解
Looking back, I don't think I ever really understood

668
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:50,063
到底他都经历过什么
what it was that he was going through.

669
00:40:50,066 --> 00:40:53,060
不仅仅是对死亡的恐惧
It was more than facing death.

670
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:56,080
而且想到自己快死了  却无法为妻儿
It was knowing that he was going to leave behind...

671
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,091
留下一分一文
nothing.

672
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:06,068
不管怎么说  也正因如此
And so that's how this all started. For better or worse,

673
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:10,063
他想要留一笔钱  所以
he wanted to provide, and so...

674
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:16,057
他用他的方式付清了所有的医疗费用
he paid his medical bills the only way he knew how.

675
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:21,036
我以为是埃利奥特和格雷琴付的
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen paid for your treatment.

676
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,053
是啊  我之前也这么以为
Yeah, I thought so, too,

677
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:26,036
但事实是  他没有拿他们一分钱
but the truth is he never took their money, not a dime.

678
00:41:27,043 --> 00:41:28,080
他的自尊心不允许自己
He was too proud to take

679
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,067
接受别人的施舍
what he considered to be charity.

680
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:33,081
我说的没错吧
Isn't that right?

681
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:42,021
所以他把心思都放在了这上面...
So he put his mind do it and--

682
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:47,012
而且你也知道他这个人
Well, you know how Walt is.

683
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:50,079
总能想出办法
He's-- He's a problem solver,

684
00:41:50,082 --> 00:41:52,026
他看了不少书
and he read books,

685
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:55,096
研究了很久之后
and he did a whole bunch of research,

686
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,053
他想出了一套
and he came up with...

687
00:41:58,056 --> 00:42:00,090
方法
this system.

688
00:42:00,093 --> 00:42:03,044
什么方法
A system?

689
00:42:03,047 --> 00:42:07,024
21点算牌法
A system for counting cards in Blackjack.

690
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:11,004
什么意思  像《雨人》里那样吗
W-What do you mean, like Rain Man?

691
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:15,015
我也不是很明白
Well, I don't pretend to understand, you know, all the details,

692
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:17,015
但他相信
but he was convinced

693
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:18,068
只要你投入足够的赌本
that if you put enough money into it,

694
00:42:18,072 --> 00:42:20,085
你就会
he'd have a, um, uh--

695
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:22,002
那叫什么来着
God, what is it?

696
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:24,086
统计学上的极限情况
A statistical edge?

697
00:42:27,063 --> 00:42:30,026
对  统计学上的...
Yes, statistical--

698
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,090
-所以  -嗯  没错
- So - Right. ...um, yeah.

699
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:33,073
所以只要他一有空
So he-- Every spare minute,

700
00:42:33,077 --> 00:42:36,080
就跑去赌
Walt was at some card table somewhere,

701
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:39,007
开始他是去赌场赌
and at first he went to the casinos,

702
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:40,067
但之后他意识到
but then he realized that--

703
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:45,078
意识到
...but then he realized

704
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:49,035
赌场会将你的赢钱记录上报给国税局
that the casinos report your winnings to the IRS,

705
00:42:49,038 --> 00:42:50,092
如果上报的话
and if it gets reported,

706
00:42:50,095 --> 00:42:52,012
可能会被家里人发现
your family might find out,

707
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:54,019
如果不想被发现的话
and if you do not want your family to find out,

708
00:42:54,022 --> 00:42:56,039
就得去另一个地方赌
then you find another place to gamble,

709
00:42:56,042 --> 00:43:00,096
比如地下非法赌场
like an illegal, backroom game.

710
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:06,060
还记得他之前总是玩失踪吗
You remember all those long walks that Walt used to take,

711
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:09,087
老是不在家的那些时候吗
all that time he used to spend away from home?

712
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,011
我想至少有几个月的时间
I guess for a couple months there you were...

713
00:43:16,014 --> 00:43:18,078
你都过着这种双重生活  对吗
sort of leading a double life, weren't you?

714
00:43:23,008 --> 00:43:25,098
天啊
Oh, my God.

715
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:28,012
天啊  你
Oh, my God, your--

716
00:43:28,015 --> 00:43:30,089
你上次所谓的神游出走  是为了掩饰这个吗
your fugue state, was that some sort of cover?

717
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:32,066
不  不是的
No. No.

718
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:35,006
那个是真的  玛丽
He did not fake that, Marie.

719
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:37,036
他失踪的那晚
The night that Walt disappeared...

720
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:45,067
输了14000
he los$14,000.

721
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:48,051
那是他的养老金
It was his pension fund,

722
00:43:48,054 --> 00:43:50,044
还有我们的存款
our savings,

723
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:54,078
基本上可以说是倾家荡产了
basically every last dime we had to our name, gone.

724
00:43:56,065 --> 00:43:59,035
所以他无法接受
He couldn't live with it.

725
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,012
死的心都有了
He was suicidal.

726
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:03,052
但你要知道
But you have to try to understand

727
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:06,016
他一离开医院
that as soon as he got out of the hospital,

728
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,003
马上就又回去赌了
he went right back to gambling.

729
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:11,023
简直是无法自拔
I mean, that's how deep this went.

730
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:16,047
你怎么能这样对她  沃尔特
How could you do that to her, Walt?

731
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:19,007
我
I, um--

732
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:23,021
不过  他想出的这套
Anyway, this system of his...

733
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:25,044
算牌方法最终成功了
he finally got it to work.

734
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:30,032
所以我想说的是
So all this is to say

735
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:31,048
我们有钱
we have the money.

736
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:33,059
虽已不再赌博
No more gambling.

737
00:44:36,032 --> 00:44:38,019
但我们不差钱
But we have the money.

738
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:44,080
有多少
How... much money?

739
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,010
沃尔特
Walt?

740
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,094
这个...
Well, uh--

741
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:00,045
大概7位数的钱吧
It's in the seven figures.

742
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:03,078
我的天
Oh, God. Holy Mary, Mother of God.

743
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:08,069
怎么说呢
What can I say?

744
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,079
我在这方面是行家
I did very well.

745
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,073
玛丽
Marie...

746
00:45:14,076 --> 00:45:17,023
你就用我们的钱
you will take our money.

747
00:45:19,023 --> 00:45:22,007
来治疗汉克
Use it to take care of Hank.

748
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:27,011
拜托了  玛丽  让我们来帮忙吧
Please. Marie, let us help.

749
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:30,044
你儿子知道这事吗
Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?

750
00:45:30,048 --> 00:45:32,061
当然不知道
Absolutely not,

751
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,081
一定要瞒着他
and I need to keep it that away,

752
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:36,038
还有汉克  好吗
and Hank-- okay--

753
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:38,005
汉克已经有太多烦心事了
Hank's got enough on his mind right now,

754
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:41,042
-所以你能帮我保密吗  -当然
- so can we just please keep this between us? - Yeah. Yeah, I--

755
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:43,039
我
Yeah, I--

756
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:44,062
我需要出去透透气
I just-- I need to--

757
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:45,096
好吧
Yeah, okay.

758
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,089
我们等下再说这个
We'll talk about it later.

759
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:51,030
你怎么想到这个的
How did you come up with that?

760
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,037
我是说
I mean, where--

761
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,014
亏你想得出来
where did you possibly--

762
00:45:57,017 --> 00:45:59,054
和你学的
I learned from the best.

763
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:09,045
我的直觉告诉我
Somehow something tells me

764
00:46:09,048 --> 00:46:11,085
汉克的事和你脱不了干系
that Hank is here because of you.

765
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:16,086
这可不是你能瞒混过关的
And I'm not forgetting that.
