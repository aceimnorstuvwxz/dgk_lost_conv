1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,018
行动代号
Operation...

2
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:07,039
破冰号
Icebreaker.

3
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:12,090
感觉怎么样  这个名字我们没有用过吧
How we liking that? We never used that before, did we?

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,000
-这不是清新薄荷糖的名字吗  -什么
- Isn't it the name of a breath mint? - What?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,064
"透心凉"  是吗  清新薄荷糖
"Icebreakers", right? Breath mint?

6
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:18,035
没有人会那么想的
Nobody's gonna be thinking that.

7
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:21,032
他们会想到一只游走在北极的大头破冰船
They'll think about a big ass ship in the north pole, breaking ice.

8
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:24,056
就你而已  我会想到清新薄荷行动
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking "operation breath mint."

9
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:25,075
每次跟你一起外勤
I'm thinking "operation breath mint"

10
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:28,003
我就会想到清新薄荷糖好吧
Every time we're on a stakeout together. All right

11
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:30,065
你嘴里那味儿能把人熏死
Your breath could knock a buzzard off a shit wagon.

12
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:32,025
好吧
All right.

13
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:35,079
行动代号待定
"Operation TBD."

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,037
格米  都被你搅和的
Thanks for nothing, Gomie.

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,028
不管怎样  先跟
Anyway. Say hello to...

16
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:43,017
多明戈·加拉多·莫利纳  疯狂小八打个招呼
Domingo Gallardo Molina, aka "Crazy 8."

17
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:46,019
他可比普通的线人精明的多
Smarter than your average cheese-eater.

18
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,052
他成为线人的时候不过是个小混混
I turned him out at the street-level,

19
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:50,026
但是这哥们向杰佛逊学习  向上拼搏
But this dude's like the Jeffersons: movin' on up.

20
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:52,005
每次他供出来的小毒贩后
Every small-time dealers he'd throw at us,

21
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:53,089
都接手了他们的客户
He'd end up snaking their customers.

22
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:56,015
现在他被证实失踪了  可能已死亡
It turns out he's missing, presumed dead.

23
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,052
在荒郊野岭发现了他的车
Found his car out in the boonies.

24
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:02,054
最后一个被他供出来的正是他自己的表弟
Last guy he ratted out was none other than his cousin,

25
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:05,033
埃米利奥·小山
Emilio koyama.

26
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,069
你认为是他表弟发现后向他报复吗
You thinking the cousin found out and took revenge?

27
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,088
有可能  结果他表弟也失踪了
Could be. Turns out he's missing, too.

28
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:13,067
一般情况  我会说有人为民除了害
And normally, I'd say someone did the world a favor.

29
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,050
但是在我们线人车中
But our snitch's car?

30
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,030
找到了两克冰毒 
Turns out we find two grams of meth in it,

31
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,071
我们带到了实验室
we take it to the lab.

32
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:23,001
实验人员告诉我们这是有史以来最纯的冰毒
They come back, they tell us it is the purest they have ever seen.

33
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,091
99.1%
99.1%.

34
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,060
我们的化学家完败  
I mean our chemist was  blown away.

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,010
说这个纯度是他的极限
He said he couldn't do the same thing better.

36
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,094
更糟的是  这并非出自墨西哥的超级实验室
Worse yet, it didn't come out of some superlab in Mexico.

37
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:32,047
我们认为制毒地点就在这儿
We're thinking this was cooked right here,

38
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:33,093
毒品交易的大本营
in the land of enchantment.

39
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,045
汽车似乎被遗弃在一个制毒地点
Car was abandoned at what appears to be a cook site.

40
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:40,074
这是遗留下来的唯一证物
This is the only other thing left behind.

41
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,055
我们正把它送到匡狄克  
We're sending it off to Quantico,

42
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:44,019
看能否找到什么线索
see if they can pull something off it.

43
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:46,077
与此同时  我们的人清洗了过滤器
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter element

44
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:48,094
发现了同样99.1%纯度的冰毒
Found the same 99.1 meth.

45
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,069
大家注意了
So be on notice.

46
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:54,099
有新毒贩来了
We got new players in town.

47
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:59,078
我们不知道他们是谁  来自何方
We don't know who they are, where they come from...

48
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,055
但是他们有高级制毒技术装备
But they possess an extremely high skill-set.

49
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,012
我个人的看法
Me personally?

50
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:08,041
我认为阿尔布开克来了位重量级人物
I'm thinking Albuquerque just might have a new kingpin.

天呐  沃尔特  你把鸡肉都烤糊了
Jesus. Walt, you're burning the shit out of them.

66
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:48,054
该死
Oh. Damn it.

67
00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:51,007
斯凯  还有鸡肉吗
Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken?

68
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,051
艾梅里尔要重新烤一批
Emeril here is gonna need a fresh pack.

69
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:57,040
恩  看起来不错
All right, looking good.

70
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,009
这个是不是低脂蛋黄酱卷心菜沙拉
Is this low-fat mayonnaise in the cole slaw?

71
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:02,061
我不知道  商店买的
I don't know. It's store-bought.

72
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:06,048
汉克  再来瓶啤酒怎么样
Hank, you need another beer?

73
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:08,027
教皇在帽子里大便了吗
Does the pope shit in his hat?

74
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:10,037
汉克  我不认为他真这么做了
I don't think that he does, Hank.

75
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:13,010
我认为大家都希望你停止谈论这个话题
And I think everybody would like it if you'd stop saying that.

76
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,032
-玛丽  再来点儿酒
- Marie, some more wine, maybe?

77
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,033
-不用了  谢谢
- I'm all right, thanks.

78
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,087
我想来瓶啤酒
Hey, I want a beer.

79
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:21,000
我还想让沙尼娅·吐温给我个"手活"呢
Yeah. I want Shania Twain to give me a tuggie.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,055
猜怎么着  那也没有发生
Guess what? That ain't happening, either.

81
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,095
-给你来点儿苏打水怎么样  -好吧
- How about some more soda? - Yeah, sure.

82
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:27,044
亲爱的  你要来儿什么吗
Honey, do you need anything?

83
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:28,096
-沃尔特  不用了
- No, Walt. Thank you.

84
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:30,082
-好的  我去去就回
- Okay. I'll be right back.

85
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,036
什么  你开玩笑吧
What, are you kidding me?

86
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:56,031
你看起来简直像个电影明星
You look like a damn movie star, man.

87
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,053
成群结队的姑娘会等着你
Girls gotta be lining up left and right.

88
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:02,026
-告诉这小子他有多帅  -他可爱极了
- Tell him how good-looking he is. - He's adorable.

89
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,073
他不不想被人说成可爱  他要性感火辣
He don't wanna be friggin' adorable. He wants to be hot.

90
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:07,049
听到我说的吗  那才是女人的想法
Anyway you see what I'm talking about? That's a female perspective.

91
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,052
她本来是想这么说的
She supposed to say that.

92
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:12,011
听着  小伙子不用看起来像
Look, a guy doesn't have to look like, uh...

93
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,016
查尔登·海斯顿一样才能赢取女孩芳心
Charlton heston... I'm talking "moses" days...

94
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:17,069
我说的是在他那个年代
To get a girl, all right?

95
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:18,083
你需要
You just gotta have...

96
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,006
自信满满
Confidence.

97
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:24,052
自信外加坚持不懈
Confidence and... and persistence.

98
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:26,055
这些是你所需要的
That's what I'm talking about.

99
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:29,012
我用尽手段来追求你姨妈玛丽
I chased your aunt Marie here all over creation.

100
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:32,031
我不断请求她和我约会  她一直拒绝
I kept bugging her for a date. She kept saying no.

101
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,059
我是不是请求了大概50次
What, did I ask you like 50 times?

102
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:37,063
那是在跟踪法被强化以前
It was before they tightened the stalking laws.

103
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:41,013
不管怎么说  让你老爹说说吧
Anyway, how about your dad here?

104
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,036
沃尔特也有段精彩的故事呢
Right there's a good story, Walt.

105
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:45,007
说说看你怎么认识斯凯勒的
Tell him how you met Skyler.

106
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:48,016
妈妈在洛斯阿拉莫斯当服务生
Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos.

107
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:52,049
然后爸爸向你表白...
And dad said that thing to you...

108
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,093
事实上  你妈妈不是服务生
Actually, your mother wasn't a waitress.

109
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,099
那不过是暑期的兼职
It was a summer job,

110
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,038
她是老板娘
And she was the hostess,

111
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:02,075
还负责收银
And she also worked the cash register.

112
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:05,014
我以前经常去那里
And I used to go in there a lot

113
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,086
因为离实验室很近  
Because it was close enough to the lab

114
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:08,086
骑自行车就能到
where I could ride my bicycle.

115
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:12,054
有一次我注意到了她
And once I noticed her...

116
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:16,013
我走进去以后
It got to be so that I would only go in

117
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,048
发现她在里面上班
When I knew she was working.

118
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:21,024
空下来的时候  她会靠着着柜台
When it was slow, she would lean against the counter,

119
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:23,051
做她的填字游戏
Doing her crossword puzzles,

120
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:26,028
不过是偷偷的
But kind of hiding it, right,

121
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:28,021
一边假装还在工作
Pretending that she was still working.

122
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:30,029
有一次被我看到了
And once I caught on to that,

123
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,057
我吃烤芝士三明治的时候也做填字游戏
I would do crossword puzzles while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.

124
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:36,081
就这样每天午餐的时候
It got so that everyday at lunch,

125
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:40,083
我们都一起做纽约时报上的填字游戏
We would both be doing the New York Times crossword puzzle

126
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,078
两人隔着10英尺远
Ten feet from each other.

127
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:48,032
终于
Eventually,

128
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:51,043
我发现她在看我
I caught her looking over at me.

129
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:55,056
于是我就说  请问
So, I began saying, "excuse me,

130
00:05:56,076 --> 00:06:01,002
横向14那个7个字母的单词  你填什么
Fourteen across, seven-letter word for whatchamacallit.

131
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:03,072
我能问问你填了什么吗
"May I ask what you wrote down?"

132
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:07,096
我们就这样聊了起来
And well, that got us talking.

133
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:12,013
天啊  告诉你  其实不会做填字游戏
Boy, I tell you, I was... I was terrible at those puzzles.

134
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:17,006
可能我连一个都没做完过
I don't think that I finished even one of them.

135
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:19,088
但你妈妈很在行
But your mother would do them in ink.

136
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,008
很厉害啊
Very smooth.

137
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:25,079
打赌你没想到你老爸也有这招吧
I'll bet you didn't think your old man had it in him?

138
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,058
但这就是我想说的  这就叫坚持
But that's what I'm talking about. That's persistence.

139
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:31,026
看见没  一旦你看准了某样东西
You see? Once you set your cap for something,

140
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:34,025
或是某个人  你就得
Or somebody, you gotta just, you know...

141
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:38,024
斯凯勒
Wow, Skyler?

142
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:41,022
妈妈  你还好吗
Mom, are you all right?

143
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:45,021
亲爱的  没关系
Shh, honey. It's okay.

144
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,004
你怎么了
What's the matter?

145
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:51,093
怎么回事
What is it?

146
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:55,033
你问他
Ask him.

147
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:07,014
她什么意思
What's she talking about?

148
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,078
沃尔特
Walt.

149
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:23,017
我得了癌症
I have cancer.

150
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:29,031
肺癌
Lung cancer.

151
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,003
太糟糕了
It's bad.

152
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,097
问问他知道多久了
Ask him how long he's known.

153
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:08,050
我想大概有一个月  或者
I guess a month, maybe, or...

154
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,026
看在老天的的份上  沃尔特
For god sakes, Walt.

155
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:13,021
我们居然还若无其事地 坐在外面在野餐
We're just sitting out there having a cookout like nothing's going on?

156
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,006
他还让我保证不告诉任何人
He made me promise not to tell anybody.

157
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:18,089
天啊  过去的48小时太难熬了
Christ, these last 48 hours.

158
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,049
而且现在是周末
And it's the weekend,

159
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:24,003
我都没办法联系上他的医生
So I couldn't even get his doctor on the phone.

160
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,089
伙计  我是说  你为什么不想告诉任何人
Buddy, why... I mean, why wouldn't you want to tell anybody?

161
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,034
沃尔特  你没看见吗
Walt, don't you see?

162
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:33,004
每个人都想帮你
Everybody just wants to help you.

163
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,044
我们是一家人
We're family.

164
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,072
我们会一起度过难关的
We get through these things together.

165
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:39,052
我不明白
I mean, I don't get... you know...

166
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,030
肺癌
Lung cancer?

167
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,094
怎么可能  你甚至都不抽烟
How could that happen? You don't smoke.

168
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:47,032
我在想这跟20年前
I'm thinking that this goes back 20 years

169
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:49,016
跟应用实验室有关
Maybe to the applications lab.

170
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,040
他们整天接触那些化学药品
All those chemicals they had you working around?

171
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,069
我们一直都有很好的预防措施
We always took the proper precautions.

172
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:57,002
有次你抱怨过  他们没给你配备正确的
One time you complained they didn't give you the right kind of...

173
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:59,094
我不知道  某种防毒面罩什么的
I don't know, some kind of ventilation hood or something.

174
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:02,098
-然后你就一直头痛  -亲爱的  不是那样的
- And then the headaches. - Honey, it wasn't that.

175
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:05,090
他们以为就能这样不负责吗
How do they think they can get away with this?

176
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,020
我们应该雇个律师
We should hire a lawyer.

177
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,050
首先  我们先治病
First, let's deal with this.

178
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,084
好吗  walt下一步怎么做
Okay? So what's the next step for Walt?

179
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,056
肯定是换个医生  对吗
Certainly a second opinion, right?

180
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:21,004
没错
Right.

181
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:22,045
没错  当然
Right. Absolutely.

182
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,032
好的  所以明天一早
Okay. So first thing tomorrow,

183
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:26,078
我会跟放射科医师谈谈
I talk to my radiologists,

184
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,005
我们会给你找到最好的
We find you the best...

185
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:33,039
治疗肿瘤的梦幻团队
The oncology dream team.

186
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:52,078
我想去看看小沃尔特
I wanna go check on Walt Jr.

187
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:55,094
我去看看
I'm gonna see...

188
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,012
不知道能不能劝他也加入我们
If I can talk him into, I don't know, joining us.

189
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:03,074
我真不是有意  让他在这种情况下知道的
I really didn't mean for him to find out that way.

190
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:15,001
沃尔特  无论发生什么
Walt...Whatever happens...

191
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,048
我真不想这么说  但是
I hope this goes without saying, but...

192
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:21,024
无论发生什么
Whatever happens...

193
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:24,021
我想你知道
I want you to know that...

194
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:28,057
我会帮你照顾好你的家庭的
I'll always take care of your family.

195
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,027
看看这些假冒的果酱馅饼
Yo, check out these fake pop tarts.

196
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,092
很好吃
These are mad tight.

197
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,058
-不用了谢谢  让开  -不吃是你的损失
- No, thanks, man. Pass.  - Your loss.

198
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:06,024
这些可是加拿大货  进口的
These are from Canada or something. Imported.

199
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,051
你的走廊怎么了  伙计
Yo, what happened to your hallway, man?

200
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:11,000
-是天花板塌了吗  -没错
- Did the ceiling fall down or... - Oh, yeah...

201
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,070
我觉得整栋房子都在下沉
I think the house is just settling.

202
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,024
到处都在掉东西下来
It's been caving in left and right.

203
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,057
正好打着我的眼睛
Hit me in the eye.

204
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,057
是香蕉
It's bananas.

205
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:23,048
我的人说不定可以帮你  
Yo, my pops could fix you up.

206
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,056
他是那种承包商之类的
He's like a contractor or something.

207
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:28,061
那行啊  我应该记他的号码
Right on. I should grab that number.

208
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:31,022
说说  杰西  你还在制冰毒吗
Say, Jesse. You still cook a little crystal?

209
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:36,058
算是吧
Could be, yeah.

210
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,036
你也清楚  我总是听说
You know, from time to time.

211
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:41,017
听说你没了搭档
I heard you lost your partner.

212
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:43,064
埃米利奥
Emilio.

213
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:46,048
-他不是被关起来了吗
- Didn't he get locked up?

214
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:48,015
-伙计  没  他出来了
- No, man. He's out.

215
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,019
他堂兄保释的  我猜他已经出了城
His cousin bailed him out. I think he skipped town or something.

216
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,076
我一点都不知道
I don't know about any of that.

217
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:55,075
这些天我都忙着自己的事呢
I've been just kinda doing my own thing these days so.

218
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:58,060
你那儿有点货吧  伙计
But you maybe got some crystal, man?

219
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,091
因为我要去酒会玩玩  
cause I could seriously go for a bowl

220
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:02,094
去爽一下
You know? Take the edge off.

221
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:05,063
周日夜派对哦
Hell, yeah. Sunday night bowl, yo.

222
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:13,065
算碰巧吧
Maybe it just so happens that...

223
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:17,031
我最近刚做了一批货
I just recently cooked the best batch ever.

224
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:23,056
嗯  用了这种全新的配法
Oh, yeah. Came up with this whole new recipe.

225
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:24,090
更像是一种分子式
It's more like a formula.

226
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:29,037
从化学上讲更科学
It's like way, way more chemically...

227
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:31,090
试制非常成功
You know, it's just the bomb.

228
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:35,097
但是  我搞不懂
But, you know, I don't know,

229
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:39,034
我后来一直在想停一段时间
I've been thinking lately I'll just lay off of it for a while.

230
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:42,014
因为我都快被它弄出妄想症了
cause lately it's been making me paranoid, so...

231
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:50,057
所以呢  为了健康考虑  就没再嗑了
You know, for, like... like healthwise, just lay off.

232
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:52,098
喂  你是不想跟咱分享吧  伙计
Yo, if you're not into sharing, man,

233
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:54,085
直接请我们滚蛋就行了  潇洒一点
Just tell us to piss off. It's cool.

234
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:56,063
我们可不想拖泥带水的
We don't need no soap opera.

235
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,027
伙计  随你啦
Yeah, man. Whatever.

236
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,006
别  没事啊
No, no. It's all good.

237
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:01,046
我  我就是说
You know, I... I'm just saying...

238
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,045
我这还有很多大麻呢
Hey, I got... I got plenty of pot.

239
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:06,049
嗯  我要闪人了  伙计
Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.

240
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,078
说的是
Yeah, sounds about right.

241
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,046
喂  喂
Hey, yo, yo.

242
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,081
兄弟
Hey, homes.

243
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,027
我开玩笑呢
I'm joking.

244
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:16,022
行了  我就是逗你们玩
Okay, I'm totally joking with you.

245
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:19,007
别闹了  坐下
You kidding? Sit down.

246
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:28,066
极品冰毒
Best scante ever.

247
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,051
把吸管拿来
Grab that pipe.

248
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,019
需要帮忙吗
Do you need some help?

249
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:53,013
不用  亲爱的  我很好
No, I'm fine, honey.

250
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,029
很好  只是

257

00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:42,030
有位顶尖的肿瘤学家
The best oncologist...

264
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,026
不只在新墨西哥州

269
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:00,052
她老板跟她打过了电话

270
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:06,000
不错
OK. This is good.

276
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:30,056
做什么用  仅仅是开个头吗
And what's that? Just to start?

277
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:33,005
就告诉一些我已经知道的东西吗
Just to tell me what I already know?

278
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,077
沃尔特  他不在我们医保系统里
Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay?

279
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:37,089
就这样了  我们会慢慢搞清楚的
So be it. We'll figure it out.

280
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:43,012
拜托  别钻钱眼里了行吗
Come on. Don't get hung up on money here.

281
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:45,097
我们可以找汉克借啊
We can always borrow from Hank.

282
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:47,033
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

283
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:51,041
不  我只是
No, I just...

284
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,022
我们绝不那样做
We're not gonna do that.

285
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:56,008
那我们可以向你母亲借
Well, maybe we can ask your Mom.

286
00:18:58,061 --> 00:19:00,080
你有没有跟她打过电话
Have you even called her yet?

287
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:06,045
先不管这事  你起码应该告诉她
Regardless, you're gonna have to tell her.

288
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,040
-我是愿意做的  -好  我来打
- I'm willing to do it...  - I'll call.

289
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:16,034
我不想让我俩总想着钱
I don't even want us thinking about money.

290
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:20,071
现在不是钱的问题  不是
Money is not the issue here. It's not.

291
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:32,013
我来管保证金的事
Okay. Okay. I'll take care of the deposit.

292
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:40,004
我从养老金里预支
I'll borrow it from my pension.

293
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,096
怎么了
What's up?

294
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:25,002
我好像听到了老鼠
I thought I heard mice.

295
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:27,049
我们要这些就够了对吧
That's all we need, huh?

296
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,049
怎么了  朋友
So, what's up, pal?

297
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,060
你到底是怎么了
What the hell's wrong with you?

298
00:20:36,054 --> 00:20:38,005
什么
What?

299
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:42,035
你表现得
You're acting all...you're

300
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,080
为什么你表现得这么
Why are you acting so...

301
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
古怪
Weird?

302
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,072
-孩子  -你就像是都没发生一样
- Son. - You're acting like nothing is going on.

303
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:46,069
怎么这样
Come on!

304
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:50,021
要我过去揍你吗
Am I gonna have to come down there and whip your ass?

305
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,002
跟你说点别的
And let me tell you something else.

306
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:06,081
我可不是为了慈善才这么做的对吧
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

307
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:09,038
我可是办公室里最棒的
I'm the best he's got in that office.

308
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:10,047
他清楚得很  我知道
He knows it, I know it.

309
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:13,002
我得要个上档次的价格
I expect to be paid to a level comens...

310
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:14,089
我说  戴夫
I said, Dave,

311
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:16,074
你觉得四万块的分红够了吗
Do you think 40 grand is a proper bonus?

312
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:18,050
还不到这个季度
That's less than 10% of

313
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,004
我给你们下的订单的百分之十
What I booked for you guys this quarter.

314
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:22,034
我才不会坐视你们对我不敬
I'm not going to sit here and be disrespected.

315
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,028
他个白痴
Oh, he's shitin bricks.

316
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,065
你知道他是什么货色
Oh, you know he is.

317
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:28,080
他就是一废物  而我能畅行无阻
Yeah, that man lives in fear. I'll go across town.

318
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,017
我去哪都行
Hell, I could go anywhere.

319
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:34,022
去霍夫曼戈登布拉德利  或是索尔彻  戈德堡韦恩也行
Hoffman-gordon-bradley or sorcher, even goldberg-wayne.

320
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:36,089
只要我肯去  他们就会让我做合伙人
They'd make me a partner just for walking in the damn door.

321
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:38,034
他们见了我就这么欣喜若狂
That's how ecstatic they'd be.

322
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:40,072
兄弟  太好了
Hells, yes, brother-man!

323
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:44,086
瞧瞧这女人
Check this chick out.

324
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:47,011
谁
Who?

325
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:50,021
伙计  她就是头猪
Buddy, she's a cow.

326
00:23:50,021 --> 00:23:52,025
斯泰茜是头猪
Stacey's a cow.

327
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:55,022
我们讨论的是猪圈的肥猪
We're talking major barnyard boo-hog.

328
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:56,096
把她在面粉里滚一滚
Roll her in flour and look for

329
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:58,032
之前看看哪儿湿了 
the wet spot before you hit that, man.

330
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:59,046
明白吗
You know what I'm saying?

331
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,069
她不是很容易摆脱的
That's kind of sick is not a wash-off

332
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:05,042
-先生  -好吧
- Sir? -Right

333
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:09,019
-先生  -是吗
- Sir? -Oh, yeah?

334
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:10,044
抱歉  你好
Sorry. Hi.

335
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:13,027
-能为您做点什么  -哪个
- What can I do for you? - Which dude?

336
00:24:13,027 --> 00:24:15,035
那个长得像蜥蜴的家伙吗
The dude that looked like a lizard?

337
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:19,029
抱歉
I'm sorry.

338
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:23,028
我要开张这全数金额的现金支票
I would like a cashier's check in the full amount

339
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:27,081
收款人是新墨西哥州肿瘤病友  谢谢
Made out to oncology partners of New Mexico, please.

340
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:33,010
是肿  瘤
Oh, that's o-n-c-o-l-o-g-y.

341
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,038
对  是这么写
Yeah, you got it.

342
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,098
我就不明白他们为什么要强迫你
I don't understand why they're forcing you

343
00:24:39,098 --> 00:24:42,006
在短笛和双簧管之间选一个
To choose between the piccolo and the oboe.

344
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:43,091
那俩种你吹都很够格
You show so much promise with both.

345
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:46,066
他们不许木管乐器有交叉
They can't have any switching between woodwinds

346
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:49,010
因为不管怎么分配  总会有个被漏掉
Because no matter how divided up, someone would be left out.

347
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,014
规定就是规定
Well, rules are rules, I guess.

348
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:53,002
是啊  规定就是规定  我完全赞成
Sure, rules and rules. I'm all for that.

349
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:56,049
不过我跟你说  你的双簧管吹得非常棒
But I'm telling you, you really shine on that oboe.

350
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:59,030
你很有天赋  我可不只是说说
You have real talent, and I'm not just saying that.

351
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,035
谢谢
Thanks.

352
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:02,093
彭伯顿老师怎么样 
What about Mr. Pemberton?

353
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:05,002
他对你关注够多吗
 Is he giving you enough individual attention?

354
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,007
我得说够多了
I'd have to say so.

355
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,046
每次练习他都尽量
He tries to talk to each one of us

356
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:09,030
至少和每个人都谈一次
At least once during every practice.

357
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,082
那很好  反馈很重要
That's good. Feedback's important.

358
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:13,044
那是关键  我认为
It's key, I think.

359
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,054
那你的足球练得怎样了
Hey, so how was soccer practice?

360
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:23,002
好像是从我们的后院传来的
I think that was in our backyard.

361
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:32,068
谁在那
Who's there?

362
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:41,018
你到底在这里干什么
What the hell are you doing out here?

363
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:46,021
爸
Hey, dad.

364
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:49,006
妈
Hey, mom.

365
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:53,073
你们添置了新的庭院摆设
You got new patio furniture.

366
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:56,057
正好夹了
Right on!

367
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:02,015
我的腿
My leg.

368
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:08,037
你觉得这次是怎么回事
What do you think it could be?

369
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:12,028
天知道  我又不是专家
God knows I'm no expert.

370
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,087
我不知道  兴奋剂  镇静剂
I don't know. Uppers, downers?

371
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:17,002
我都能猜   你不也能吗
Your guess is as good as mine.

372
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,088
我想我们得看看他胳膊上有没有针孔
I think we should check his arms for needle marks.

373
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:25,008
要让他住下吗
Do we let him stay?

374
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:28,085
长老会教堂有些集会
The presbyterian church has those meetings.

375
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:31,053
也许某些条件下
So maybe on condition, you know?

376
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:32,090
他会同意参加的
If he agrees to attend?

377
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,062
我只是不知道该怎么跟Jake说
I just don't know what to tell Jake.

378
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:47,036
晚上好
Good evening.

379
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:50,055
睡好了吗
Well, sleep well?

380
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:54,029
几点吃晚饭
What time's, uh... what time is dinner?

381
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:57,062
还得一小时吧
In about an hour.

382
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:04,041
你要是愿意我可以帮你把衣服洗了
You know, I could wash those clothes if you'd like.

383
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,016
看起来有些脏了
They look a little lived in.

384
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,006
不用  这挺好
No, that's cool.

385
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:10,081
不然晚一点再说
Maybe later.

386
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:17,041
我们不能再这么做了
We are not doing this again.

387
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,073
-亚当  -不行
- Adam... - No.

388
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:22,089
我们说过要严责  我们就得严责
We said we'd lay down the law, we lay down the law.

389
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,093
我们要贯彻执行
We just have to be consistent about it.

390
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:17,037
你没坐校车
You're not taking the bus?

391
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,009
好吧  那么
All right, well, listen.

392
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:27,072
再给我20分钟  我们就回去
Give me maybe another 20 minutes and we'll get out of here.

393
00:29:27,072 --> 00:29:30,028
-好吧  -好吧
- All right. - All right.

394
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:33,027
很好
Yeah, good.

395
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:08,022
你瞧  我只是在想
You know, I just think that...

396
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:14,017
事情总会有解决的办法的
Things have a way of working themselves out.

397
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:40,099
你啥时候得这奖的
When did you get this?

398
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:43,026
去年5月的年终总结会上
Last may at the year-end assembly.

399
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:45,001
他们还给了我那个
They gave me that one, too.

400
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,080
摆最后面那个
The one on the end.

401
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:51,084
环保意识奖
Environmental consciousness award.

402
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:52,054
这什么玩意儿
What's that mean?

403
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:54,084
是说你喜欢回收破易拉罐吗
You, like, recycle cans and shit?

404
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:57,088
我联系了阿尔布开克杂志社
I contacted the Albuquerque Journal

405
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,019
询问了他们是用什么化学品来漂白纸张
And asked what chemicals they use to bleach their paper.

406
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:02,011
他们为此专门撰写了一篇文章
They wound up writing an article about it.

407
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:03,098
干得好  小兄弟
Right on, little bro!

408
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:06,085
还能把工商界再搞个天翻地覆
Making mad in-roads with the business community.

409
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:08,007
挺好
All right!

410
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:10,078
现在  听着
Now, hey, remember,

411
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:14,004
有些东西靠读书是学不来的
Not all learning comes out of books.

412
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,021
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

413
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:23,019
我们应该多出去溜达溜达
We should hang out more often.

414
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,069
你瞧  只是
You know, just...

415
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:26,082
绕绕圈  透透气什么的
Just kick back and chill.

416
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:29,010
我是说  如果你
I mean, if you ever,

417
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,014
怎么说呢  需要开导的时候
Like, I don't know, need advice.

418
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:34,017
因为  我的意思是
Because, yo, I mean,

419
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,024
毕竟我什么都曾经历过
I've been through it all. For real.

420
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:41,062
喂  哥们  你
Hey, man, you...

421
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:43,068
你会吹长笛的啊
You play the flute?

422
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,055
其实那是短笛
It's a piccolo, actually.

423
00:31:46,055 --> 00:31:48,064
那给来段杰斯罗·塔尔(乐队名)的吧
Dude, play some... play some Jethro Tull.

424
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:53,010
嘿  小伙们
Hey, guys.

425
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,038
聊得怎么样
How we doing in here?

426
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,084
挺好的
We're good.

427
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,020
嗯  挺好  妈
Yeah. Fine, mom.

428
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,082
行  那就好
Well, that's good.

429
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:06,019
太  太好了
That's... that's great.

430
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:15,064
什么情况
What the hell?

431
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:17,072
瞧这情形
You see this?

432
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:20,021
我是个罪犯还是咋的
What, am I some criminal or something?

433
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,028
-无所谓啦  -无所谓吗
- Whatever. - Whatever?

434
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:25,094
你觉得这是无所谓吗
What, you think that's okay?

435
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:29,015
这就像  我们不能让那个坏蛋
Like, "oh, we can't let that scumbag"

436
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:31,039
带坏我们的宝贝孩子
"warp the mind of our favorite son."

437
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,015
我是宝贝吗
I'm the favorite?

438
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:36,027
得了吧
Yeah, right.

439
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:39,023
他们最常挂在嘴边的是你
You're practically all they ever talk about.

440
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,062
我靠
Oh, snap.

441
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,080
真帅
Awesome.

442
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:57,097
哥们  是我
Yo, man, it's me.

443
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:01,035
听着  你的那个货
Hey, listen. You know, that product?

444
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:03,065
你还有没
You got any more of that?

445
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:05,046
没了  哥们  行吗
Nah, man, okay?

446
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:06,083
我不能再免费给了
I'm done giving out freebies.

447
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,094
想要免费的就去找救世军吧
You want charity, go ask the salvation army.

448
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:10,005
不  没有免费了
No, no charity.

449
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:11,094
我有个表哥
I got this cousin,

450
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:13,030
他认识几个款爷
He's got him some rich friends.

451
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,062
他们就在城里
These dudes are in town.

452
00:35:14,062 --> 00:35:16,030
正准备开个聚会呢
They're looking to par-tay.

453
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,045
而你那货真是  太爽了
And your stuff is, like, so sweet.

454
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:20,093
你觉得怎么样
So what do you say?

455
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:24,042
要不要再干一笔大的
You up for making some fat stacks?

456
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:26,020
他们会买下所有的货
Because they'll buy everything you got.

457
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:48,021
这不是来真的吧
You can't be serious.

458
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:51,076
你来这干嘛呢
What the hell are you doing here?

459
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:54,006
我等那臭小子走了后才来的
Yo, I waited till the bowl buster left.

460
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:55,078
我是说  无意的
I mean, no offense.

461
00:35:58,053 --> 00:35:59,092
谁让你来的
Who sent you?

462
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:02,092
带窃听器了  来陷害我吗
You wearing a wire? You setting me up?

463
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:05,068
窃听器  你想要窃听器
A wire? you want a wire?

464
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:08,058
我倒有个  来跟我老二说吧  傻B
I got a wire. Speak into the mic, bitch!

465
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:13,081
你脑子进水了吧  窃听器
What the hell's wrong with you? A wire. Jesus.

466
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:17,007
那你跟谁说了
So who did you tell about...

467
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,096
没人  你咋了  疯了吗
Nobody. What are you, nuts?

468
00:36:18,096 --> 00:36:20,055
那你来干什么
Then why are you here?

469
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:23,083
我不知道
I don't know.

470
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,043
就是来
To, like...

471
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:27,078
打个招呼吧
Touch base.

472
00:36:27,078 --> 00:36:30,010
打个招呼
Touch base?

473
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,033
是的  你知道
Yeah, you know...

474
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:34,030
你把那叫啥来着
What you call...

475
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,071
汇报工作吧
A debrief?

476
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:39,042
也许我们该
Maybe we could, like...

477
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,068
我觉得我们该汇报下工作了
I thought we could debrief.

478
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,041
汇报工作
Debrief?

479
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,027
哈  你觉得
Wow, that's...

480
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:47,076
你觉得我们该汇报下工作了
That's what you think we need, to debrief?

481
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:52,004
是啊  那些事发生后
Yeah, after what happened

482
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:54,007
看上去似乎该做做汇报了
It just seems like the thing to do.

483
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:56,023
比如说  你知道的
Kind of, you know, talk about it.

484
00:36:56,023 --> 00:36:59,048
咱跟谁都不能提起的那些事
We can't talk to anybody else.

485
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:03,072
还有就是  我想
Anyway, that, and I wanted to...

486
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:07,042
我想告诉你大家有多喜欢
I wanted to tell you how much everybody digs

487
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:09,086
我们做的冰毒
That meth we cooked.

488
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:12,008
他们趋之若鹜
Everybody digs the meth...

489
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:14,004
我们做的
We cooked.

490
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:15,096
说正经的  我有个兄弟
Seriously, I got...

491
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:18,070
宁愿自己少块肉
Dudes that would give their left nut

492
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,039
都想再来上点
For a little more.

493
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,094
那挺好
Great.

494
00:37:21,094 --> 00:37:24,065
我想说的是  如果你
I'm just saying, if you ever...

495
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:28,005
真的看开了的话
Saw your way clear to...

496
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:30,015
我是说  我们俩
You know, you and I...

497
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:33,025
可以再制点冰毒啥的
Cooking a little more.

498
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:43,083
滚出我的家
Get the hell off my property.

499
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:46,044
-什么  我说说而已嘛  -不许再踏进我家
- What? I'm just saying. - Go and don't come back.

500
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:48,083
马上滚
Now!

501
00:37:50,043 --> 00:37:51,090
好的
All right.

502
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,024
你知道吗
You know what?

503
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,076
4000大洋
Four grand.

504
00:37:56,076 --> 00:38:01,061
上次那批货卖掉了  这是你的份
Your share from selling that batch.

505
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:03,065
所以我才来找你
That's why I'm here.

506
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:06,011
是啊  没错
Yeah, that's right.

507
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:08,041
我一点都没抽过
I didn't smoke it all.

508
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:36,079
非小细胞型腺癌
Non-small cell adenocarcinoma.

509
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,053
到了第三期[即中晚期]
Stage 3A,

510
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:41,016
意味着癌细胞从肺部扩散到了淋巴组织
Which means it's spread from the lung to the lymph nodes.

511
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:43,073
毫无疑问  已经很严重了
There's no denying it's very serious.

512
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:46,068
不过这...
But is it...

513
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:49,013
这是...
It is...

514
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:51,077
是可以治愈的吧
Curable?

515
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:54,026
我觉得  能治疗  更合适
I prefer the word "treatable."

516
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:58,091
但我们采用的治疗方法可以说非常有效
But the treatments we have at our disposal can be very effective.

517
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:01,032
虽然不能打保票  但我可以说
Without making any promises, I can tell you that

518
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:04,054
我所要推荐的放疗和化疗
The specific course of radiation and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest

519
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:06,040
一直都很成功
Has been successful.

520
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,031
在某些病例中
In certain cases,

521
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:10,010
延长了病人生命  甚至缓解了病情
It prolonged patients' lives and even resulted in remission.

522
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:14,070
那副作用呢
What about the side effects?

523
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:19,005
副作用有可能平缓到忽略不计
Well, they can be mild to practically non-existent,

524
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,064
也有可能非常强烈
Or they can be pretty darn awful.

525
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,096
这都是因人而异的
It varies from patient to patient.

526
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:24,068
典型的有  脱发
Typically, there's hair loss,

527
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:27,090
化疗开始的几周内就会开始脱发
Which begins a couple of weeks after the start of chemotherapy.

528
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:32,051
还会觉得特别疲劳  浑身乏力
You may find yourself unusually fatigued, not much energy.

529
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:33,086
嗜睡  不想起床
You won't want to get out of bed.

530
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:38,035
因食欲不振  肠胃不适而导致体重下降
You may lose weight due to reduced appetite and certain intestinal issues.

531
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:41,051
肌肉酸痛  牙龈疼痛出血
Muscle aches and pains, gums get sore and bleed.

532
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:45,083
当然了  还有可能呕吐
And, of course, there's the possibility of nausea.

533
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:49,084
不过我们会开些止吐剂  帮助缓解症状
Although, we'll prescribe an anti-emetic and try to counteract that.

534
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:52,022
还可能刺激肾脏和膀胱
Possible kidney or bladder irritation.

535
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,054
稍有不慎就会引起淤青和流血
You may wind up with increased bruising and bleeding.

536
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:57,034
还会对性生活造成影响
There may be sexual side effects.

537
00:39:57,034 --> 00:40:00,035
皮肤会变得干燥  易怒
Your skin may become dry and irritated...

538
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:30,021
你还有什么话说吗
Got anything to say?

539
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,034
你知道这是什么吗
What do you know about that?

540
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:43,048
-不知道  -这次别想蒙混过关
- Nothing. - That's not going to fly this time.

541
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,095
我们给过你多少机会
How many chances have we given you?

542
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:48,093
多少次我们就坐在这里
How many times have we sat right here

543
00:40:48,093 --> 00:40:51,054
一次又一次重复着同样的对话
And had the same conversation over and over again

544
00:40:51,054 --> 00:40:54,008
你就这么看着我们  做出一脸无辜的样子
Where you look us in the eye and you plead ignorance,

545
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:55,084
你玩弄了我们的感情
And you play on our emotions,

546
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:58,078
就会说好话哄着我们
And you tell us anything you think we want to hear

547
00:40:58,078 --> 00:41:01,019
好让我们再给你一次机会
Just so we'll give you another chance?

548
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:05,067
你每次都把我们当傻瓜耍着玩
And it makes us feel like fools, every time.

549
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,081
够了  杰西
Enough, Jesse.

550
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:14,022
到此为止了
Enough.

551
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:17,067
我们家不允许出现这种东西
We are not going to have this in our house.

552
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:21,035
我们要你离开这里
We need you to leave.

553
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:02,078
谢谢你没有告发我
Thanks for not telling on me.

554
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:10,005
你能还给我吗
You think I could have it back?

555
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,004
顺便说  这大麻也太次了
It's skunk weed anyway.

556
00:42:51,014 --> 00:42:54,031
这病还是很有治愈希望的
You know, this is actually very hopeful.

557
00:42:59,058 --> 00:43:02,043
你听到了吗
Did you hear me?

558
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:06,015
我说  你这病治愈的希望还是很大的
I said this is really very, very hopeful.

559
00:43:11,038 --> 00:43:14,009
我去打电话告诉他们  下周开始治疗好吗
Can I call them and tell them you'll start next week?

560
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:32,002
我只是觉得我们该...
I just think that we need to...

561
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:35,005
再讨论一下  如此而已
Discuss it a little more, that's all.

562
00:43:35,005 --> 00:43:37,043
有什么好讨论的
What is there to discuss?

563
00:43:37,043 --> 00:43:39,066
你要得到最好的治疗
You're going to get the best treatment

564
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:41,053
而他是这方面的权威
And he's the best.

565
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:43,007
是关于钱的问题
Well, there's the money discussion.

566
00:43:43,007 --> 00:43:47,005
就这么赔上9万美元
$90,000 out of pocket.

567
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:49,024
-可能还不止  -总会有办法的  沃尔特
- Maybe more. - There's a way, Walt.

568
00:43:49,024 --> 00:43:53,010
可以贷款  还可以分期付款
There's financing, there's installment plans.

569
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,003
我也可以随时出去工作
I could always go back to work.

570
00:43:55,003 --> 00:43:57,030
沃尔特  总会有办法的
Walt, there's always a way.

571
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,090
好吧
All right.

572
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:01,054
斯凯勒  即使这个办法行得通
Skyler, say that there is a way.

573
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:04,009
我们把钱都花下去了  而我
And we spend all that money, and...

574
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:20,041
我能就这么让你们去扛这一大笔债吗
Am I supposed to leave you with all that debt?

575
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:27,004
我做不到  我只是不想感情用事罢了
No. I just don't want emotions ruling us.

576
00:44:27,004 --> 00:44:30,068
也许  治疗不是个好办法
Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.

577
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:36,009
那你为什么不早点死了算了
Then why don't you just fucking die already?

578
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:40,080
放弃治疗  一了百了
Just give up and die.

579
00:45:30,098 --> 00:45:32,084
给我闪开
Come on, move your ass.

580
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:37,014
我有什么好担心的
What do I care?

581
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:41,009
我不担心  我可有最好的律师
Yeah, I'm not worried. I have the best fucking attorney.

582
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:45,008
我要是对方  现在就该感到害怕了
I would not want to be on the other side of this one...

583
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:11,001
该死的怎么回事啊
What the hell?

584
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:15,031
还愣着干嘛  快找人帮忙  快打119啊
What are you doing? Call somebody, call the fire people.

585
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:20,045
简直难以置信  你知道我这车有多贵吗
I don't believe it. You know how much I paid for that?

586
00:47:26,008 --> 00:47:27,076
这到底怎么回事啊
Why is it doing this?
