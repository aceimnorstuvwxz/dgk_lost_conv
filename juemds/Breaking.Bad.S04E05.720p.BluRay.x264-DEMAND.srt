我知道你和麦克在一起
I know you're with Mike.

50
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,260
你没事吧
Are-- Are you all right?

51
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,830
他是不是拿枪指着你呢
Does he have a gun on you?

52
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,250
没有
No.

53
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,680

Well, what's going on, then?

54
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,050
开车

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
开车
Driving?

去哪
Driving where?

57
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,450
不清楚
I don't know.

58
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,550
向北吧
Uh, north.

59
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,150
他为什么开车带着你
W-W-- Why is he driving you?

60
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,250
他要去哪
Where is he going?

61
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,990
不知道
Beats me.

62
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,890
我...我
I-- I don't-- I--

63
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,150
让麦克接电话
Put Mike back on.

64
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,220
你好
Hello again.

65
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,620
麦克  告诉我你们打算干什么
Mike, tell me know exactly what is going on.

66
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,350
杰西今天跟着我  你就老老实实
Jesse's with me today, so what you need to do

67
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,640
回实验室继续制毒
is to go back to your lab and get on with the cook.

68
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,320
你得自己把活干完
You're gonna have to muddle through this one without him, okay?

69
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,950
就是这么个情况
That's what's going on.

70
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,390
但是这
But it doesn't--

71
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,490
再见  沃尔特
Goodbye, Walter.

72
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,690
麦克
Mike--

73
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,390
先生
Sir--

74
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,490
打扰一下  先生
Excuse me. Hey.

75
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,950
你不能到后面来
You're not allowed back there.

76
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,020
抱歉  先生
Excuse me, sir.

77
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,520
我告诉您了  福林先生不在这
As I said, sir, Mr. Fring is not here.

78
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,190
这里是顾客禁区
This area's for employees only,

79
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,020
您得马上离开
and I have to ask that you leave immediately.

80
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,990
你告诉怀特老师的话
What you told Mr. White, that's...

81
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,220
都是扯淡  是吧
that's just bullshit, right?

82
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,990
你就打算把我扔到什么荒郊野岭去是吧
You, uh, you figure on just leaving me in some ditch?

83
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,120
你很关心么
What do you care?

84
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,390
不
I don't.

85
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,290
但我得和你说明白了  你最好打准点
But I'll tell you now, you better shoot straight,

86
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,090
老头
old man,

87
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,790
不然我就把先把你的另一只耳朵
or I'll slice off your other ear

88
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,720
割下来
before this is over.

89
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,890
你走么
You coming?

90
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,650
这活今天我们还得再做六遍
We got to do this six more times today,

91
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,590
每次中间还有很长的路要开
with a lot of miles in between.

92
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,520
我希望天黑之前能完成
I'd like to finish before dark.

93
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,200
这个怪胎  我给你说
This freaking guy, I tell you what.

94
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,180
就好像是疤面煞星和罗杰斯先生
It's like Scarface had sex

95
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,270
做爱一样
with Mister Rogers or something.

96
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,570
谁说做这个啊
Who does this, you know?

97
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,010
你追查的毒贩  海森伯格
Your boy Heisenberg.

98
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,340
还以为我们已经抓住他了
Thought we had him already.

99
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,370
是啊  你就想吧
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

100
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,410
是啊  不是
Yeah, no.

101
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,770
盖茨几个月前抓住过他
Getz busted him a few months back.

102
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,970
是么  不是瞧不起
Yeah, well, no offense

103
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,670
这个杜奇・豪瑟探员
to Detective Doogie Howser there,

104
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,670
{\an8}<i><font color="FFFF80">Doogie Howser  天才小医生主角名字</i>

105
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,640
他抓住的只是个笨蛋重刑犯
but all he caught was a dipshit lifer

106
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,540
名字叫惯犯吉米
by the name of Jimmy In-N-Out.

107
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,370
这个  这是你要找的海森伯格么
This one-- he's your Heisenberg?

108
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,040
是的  我觉得他是
Yeah, I believe he is.

109
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,070
那你是怎么判断的
So what are you thinking?

110
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
竞争对手的毒品团伙所为
Rival drug gang taking out the mastermind?

111
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,370
有什么嫌疑人物需要我查么
Any names I should check out?

112
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,940
希望我能帮上你
I wish I could help you there.

113
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,740
我只认识两个和蓝色冰毒有关的人
Only two people I know connected with the blue stuff.

114
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,410
一个整天带着小童帽的废柴
Uh, one is a beanie-wearing j-- stain

115
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,140
叫布兰登・梅休
by the name of Brandon Mayhew--

116
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,770
道上的名字  猴子
street name, uh, Badger.

117
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,540
绝对是个小角色
Definitely another player.

118
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,440
另一个  杰西・平克曼
The other one is, uh, Jesse Pinkman.

119
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,470
他和我还有段故事
He and I have a history.

120
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,100
是啊
Yeah.

121
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,310
你觉得平克曼是杀手么
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

122
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,070
那我会很吃惊的
That would surprise me.

123
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,780
我们合成了一个嫌疑人的画像
Well, we got a composite of a person of interest.

124
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,200
是邻居在伯蒂切家
It's a guy the neighbors saw

125
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,270
发生枪击之后看到的
at Boetticher's place right after the shooting.

126
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,810
没印象
Eh...sorry.

127
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,510
不  留着吧  以防万一
No, hang on to it, just in case.

128
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,010
我们还弄到几个指纹来检验身份
Then we got a couple of prints we're hoping to I.D.

129
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,510
如果有匹配的
If I get any kind of hit,

130
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,310
我会通知你
I'll keep you in the loop on that.

131
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,340
你知道  提姆
You know, uh, Tim,

132
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,200
听着  我很感谢你做的事情  真的
look, I appreciate what you're doing, really--

133
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,100
就是一直让我参与此事
uh, you know, keeping me involved and all,

134
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,770
但是  你知道
but, uh, you know,

135
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,760
看到海森伯格就这样死了
finding this guy Heisenberg dead like this...

136
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,070
我要说
I have to say, it, uh...

137
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,970
对我来说就算谢幕了
kind of feels like closure to me, you know?

138
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,040
汉克  你能帮我们很大的忙
Hank, you really are a big help here.

139
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,840
我知道  我了解
No, I know. I get it, really.

140
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,100
但是  我已经完成使命了
But I'm done.

141
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,870
别这样
Oh, no.

142
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,470
你不用这样
You don't need to do that.

143
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,340
这不是我在这的原因么
This is why I'm out here, right?

144
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,410
给你打后援
To be, like, your backup?

145
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,670
那么说如果我在这给你当保镖
So if I'm out here in a guard-type capacity

146
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,940
看着这些钱
to watch over the money,

147
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,510
那我得需要一支枪对吧
that means I need, like, a gun, right?

148
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,100
不对
Nope.

149
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,760
要是没枪
I mean, isn't that, like, completely idiotic

150
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,510
我站在这不成傻子了么
for me to be out here without a gun?

151
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,310
我来这干什么
I mean, you haven't said dick

152
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,550
你也不告诉我
about what I'm supposed to be doing here,

153
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,270
然后还不给我枪
and I'm supposed to do it without a gun?

154
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,910
这根本没道理啊
How does that even make sense?

155
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,140
怎么了
What?

156
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,840
我能抽烟的  对吧
I can smoke, right?

157
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,270
不可能
Not a chance.

158
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,850
谬论啊
Fallacies

159
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,810
谬论啊
Fallacies

160
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,470
一个给你  两个给我
One for you and two for me

161
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,010
我终于知道计划是什么了
It's finally hitting me what the-- the plan is here.

162
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,640
就是想把我无聊死  那么
It's to bore me to death, so...

163
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,200
太管用了  任务成功了
mission accomplished because it's totally working.

164
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,510
做的好
Great job.

165
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,010
你知道么  我完全明白
You know, I really do get what's going on

166
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,700
这些接头点和现金的作用
with all the dead drops and bags of cash.

167
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,510
当年我贩毒的时候
I mean, my boys had the exact same system

168
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,570
我的手下也是这么搞的
when I was running things.

169
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,240
我的员工
My crew.

170
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,610
利润虽然没你们的丰厚
Nowhere near the same cheese you guys are slinging,

171
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,670
但道理是一样的
but same theory--

172
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,770
把供货商和经销商完全分离
to maintain separation between dealer and supplier,

173
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,770
规避风险
reduce risk,

174
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,770
等等
et cetera.

175
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,550
不是  你不觉得你来我往的对话
Look, don't you think it would be good

176
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,840
会更好些么
if there was some back and forth communication here?

177
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,310
你让我坐在副驾驶上
You got me riding shotgun

178
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,070
让我见识了这个州最黑暗的角落
to every dark anal recess of this state.

179
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,540
对我友善点  给我透点消息
Be nice if you clued me in a little.

180
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,100
我来这是干活的
I mean, I'm here to do a job, right?

181
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,740
我是说  如果我就是这个人
And, I mean, yo, like, if I'm the guy,

182
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,070
你至少得告诉我这到底是怎么一回事吧
then you should just tell me what the hell's up.

183
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,840
怎么了
What?

184
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,870
你不是那个人
You are not the guy.

185
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,740
你当不了那个人
You're not capable of being the guy.

186
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,470
我本来有个人  但现在我没有了
I had a guy, but now I don't.

187
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,240
你  不是那个人
You are not the guy.

188
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,370
那告诉我  我到底是来干什么的
Then what the hell am I doing here?

189
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,970
我不知道  我说了不算
I don't know. It's not my call.

190
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,240
我只是奉命行事
I just do what I'm told,

191
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,170
现在你也要奉命从事
and now you're gonna do what you're told,

192
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,740
那就是  坐好  闭嘴
which is to sit here, shut up,

193
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,510
呆在车里  直到把活干完
and stay in the car till we finish our pickups.

194
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,870
明白了么
You got it?

195
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,610
要改变主意么
We having second thoughts?

196
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,240
时刻都有
Every hour of every day.

197
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,970
给你们说  这是绝对正常的
Let me tell you, that is perfectly normal.

198
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,340
但你们的预期是实际的
But your expectations are realistic.

199
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,440
你们有一个妥善  可靠的商业计划
You have a good, solid business plan.

200
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,470
我感觉很有信心
I'm feeling very confident.

201
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,110
你们有很大的机会来做成这件事
You have an excellent shot at making this work.

202
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,310
沃尔特
Walt.

203
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,540
没问题吧
We good?

204
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,640
没有
Yeah.

205
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,810
好的
All right.

206
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,270
祝贺您二位
Well, my congratulations to the both of you.

207
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
谢谢你  艾伦
Thank you very much, Alan.

208
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,210
不客气
It is my pleasure.

209
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,600
怀特先生
Mr. White.

210
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,370
祝您好运
Best of luck.

211
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,510
谢谢
Thank you.

212
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,410
下周我先把我的车开过来
I'm bringing my car over first thing next week

213
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,150
清洁打蜡
for a wash and wax.

214
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,040
期待你的到来
Oh, well, we'll be looking for you.

215
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,460
我会来的
I'll be there.

216
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,450
再次感谢
Thank you again.

217
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,260
不客气
You're welcome.

218
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,470
-再见  -再见
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

219
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,640
这回成真了
Wow. It's official.

220
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,340
感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

221
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,210
我
I'm...

222
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,110
我  你感觉怎么样
well, I'm-- How do you feel?

223
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,610
紧张
Uh...nervous.

224
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,540
害怕
Scared.

225
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,240
这是巨大的一步  沃尔特
This is a big step, Walt.

226
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,300
如果我们做的对
If we don't do this right--

227
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,010
我们会很好的
We'll be fine.

228
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,010
会么
We will?

229
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,110
再给我说一遍
Tell me again.

230
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,140
我们会很好的  相信我
We will be fine. Believe it.

231
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,670
如果我们要这样
If we're going to do this--

232
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,640
如果我们真的要这样
I mean, we're really going to do this--

233
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,740
那我们得向对方保证
then we have to promise each other

234
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,810
不能再有秘密
no more secrets.

235
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,210
再也不能出现之前的错误了
There can't be any mistakes like before.

236
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,210
要绝对坦诚
There has to be complete honesty.

237
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,770
我完全赞成
I'm all for that.

238
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,110
好
Good.

239
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,810
那么
Well, then, uh,

240
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,740
喝一杯庆祝一下怎么样
how about a drink to celebrate?

241
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,540
现在  我们拥有一大间洗车房了
Well-- well, we own a big-a-- car wash now.

242
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,340
没错  我认为这值得庆祝
We do. I guess that merits a celebration.

243
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,740
别太贵的
Nothing too expensive.

244
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,540
明白  明白
Right. Right.

245
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,640
那就喝点普通的
Non-fancy liquor it is.

246
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,870
直到工作完成
Just as long as it gets the job done.

247
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,510
是我
Uh, it's me.

248
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,070
我就是想说
I just wanted to say

249
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,940
我一直挂念着你  挂念着孩子
that I was thinking about you and the kids,

250
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,810
还有
and, uh...

251
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,610
我爱你
I love you.

252
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,470
好了
Ok.

253
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,630
-快脱了  -好的
- Just take it off.  - Okay.

254
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,410
-快脱了  -好的
- Just take it off.  - Okay.

255
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,210
-快脱了  -好的
- Just take it off.  - Okay.

256
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,480
床单的味道和以前不一样了
The sheets, they smell different than I remember.

257
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,750
换了新的织物柔软剂
New fabric softener.

258
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,080
我很喜欢
Mm, I like it.

259
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,750
我
I, uh...

260
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,950
还换了个新发型
also got a new haircut.

261
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,550
不知道你
Don't know if you--

262
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,150
是的  我是想说点什么来着
Oh, yes, I-- I was going to say something.

263
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,950
真的么
Were you, really?

264
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,420
我确实很喜欢
I do like it.

265
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,110
谢谢
Thanks.

266
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,350
那明晚一起吃晚餐
So, um, dinner tomorrow night?

267
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,280
我跟玛丽说了我们会过去和他们一起吃
I told Marie that we'd come over and eat with them.

268
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,980
有空么
Uh, think maybe you'll be free?

269
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,250
有
Yeah.

270
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,850
我们一起去
Yeah, we can do that.

271
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,860
那样挺好的
That'll-- That'll be nice.

272
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,550
好
Good.

273
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,650
玛丽说这是能让汉克离开房间
Marie says it's about the only thing

274
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,050
唯一的办法
that'll get Hank out of his room.

275
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,510
妈妈
Mom.

276
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,980
妈妈  爸爸
Hey, Mom, Dad.

277
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,010
儿子
Hi, son.

278
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,150
你们在哪
Where are you?

279
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,770
我们在里屋
Uh, we're-- we're back here.

280
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,680
我们这就出来
We'll be out in a minute.

281
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,950
他知道你回来了
He knows that you're here.

282
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,420
我车停在外面呢
I'm parked in the driveway.

283
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,610
这下晚餐时间
Oh. This is going to make

284
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,850
可要添些有趣的话题了
for some very interesting dinner conversation.

285
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,880
他肯定要问到我们目前的生活状况
He's definitely going to ask about our living situation now.

286
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,780
也许
Maybe, uh...

287
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,620
也许你该搬回来住
maybe you should move back in,

288
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,740
这样
you know,

289
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,250
更容易向大家解释
just so it's, uh, easier to explain to everyone.

290
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,810
你觉得呢
You think?

291
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,580
我得回去工作了
I have to get back to work.

292
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,480
有时间安排的
You know, schedule.

293
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,180
明白
Yeah.

294
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,450
该死
Damn it.

295
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,050
喂
Hey!

296
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,500
这是两个人干的活
Hey! This is a two-man job!

297
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,570
我一个人做不来
I can't do it alone!

298
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,130
我受够了  够了  不干了
I'm done! That's it! Finished!

299
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,630
在我搭档回来之前  我罢工
Nothing else happens until I get my partner back.

300
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,200
杰西
Jesse?

301
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,060
杰西在哪
Where's Jesse?

302
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,860
我需要他
I need him.

303
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,570
你们这些人想让我
You people have me down here

304
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,660
一个人完成两个人的操作
trying to complete a two-man operation by myself!

305
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,180
这不可能
It's unacceptable.

306
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,200
这样很危险  后果不堪设想
It's dangerous and counterproductive.

307
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,830
杰西负责操作铲车  不是我
Jesse operates the forklift, not me.

308
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,710
这只是他在实验室
That's just one of the many,

309
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,300
做的很多事情之一
many things he does around the lab

310
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,540
这样才能让我们跟上进度
that keeps us on schedule,

311
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,030
所以我建议你们把他带回来
so I suggest that you get him back down here

312
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,200
在你们...
as soon as you p--

313
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,600
你在听我说话吗
Are you listening to me?

314
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,900
喂
Hello!

315
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,460
你想把它放哪
Where do you want it?

316
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,100
就是这儿了  对吧  最后一站
This is it, right? Last stop?

317
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,460
最后一站
Last stop?

318
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,730
我一直在数着
Hey, I've been counting, yo.

319
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,330
之后就完工了
No more pickups after--

320
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,960
谬论啊
Fallacies...

321
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,860
谬论啊
fallacies.

322
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,260
谬论啊  谬论啊
Fallacies, fallacies.

323
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,850
你一个  我一个
One for you, two for me.

324
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:44,230
谬论啊  谬论啊
Fallacies, fallacies...

325
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,530
我需要人来接我
Yeah. I'm gonna need to be picked up.

326
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,860
现在
Now.

327
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,830
市中心的加西亚咖啡
Garcia's on Central.

328
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,500
按一声喇叭  在停车场等我
Honk once. I'll meet you in the parking lot.

329
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
不必了
Cancel that.

330
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,130
有个家伙
Hey, this dude--

331
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,110
有个人朝我走来
this dude was coming right at me

332
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,300
手里拿着把猎枪
with a-- with a shotgun.

333
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,990
他们堵住了巷口
All right? They, like, blocked the alley,

334
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,340
打算对我们打劫
and they were going to rip us off, man.

335
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,640
我别无选择
I didn't have a choice, okay?

336
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,750
我不得不向后倒  撞上那家伙的车
I had to put it in reverse, slam into the guy's car,

337
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,960
就那么...
and just-- --

338
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,330
我看见了
I saw.

339
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,260
老天啊
Ah, Jesus.

340
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,800
我只是
I just--

341
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,760
我不知道
I don't know.

342
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,130
没关系  孩子
Go ahead, kid.

343
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,130
抽吧
Smoke up.

344
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,740
早上好
Good morning.

345
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,140
早上好  儿子
Hey. Good morning, son.

346
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,820
我给你倒点果汁吧
You want me to pour you some juice?

347
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,090
我要喝咖啡
I'll take coffee.

348
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,890
我都不知道你开始喝咖啡了
Didn't know you started drinking coffee.

349
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,900
是啊  我还开始系鞋带了
Yeah. I also started tying my own shoelaces, too,

350
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,570
全靠自己
all by myself.

351
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,160
去拿个杯子
Go grab a mug.

352
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,590
加奶还是糖
Milk? Sugar?

353
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,890
黑咖啡就好
Just black.

354
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,440
黑咖  我喜欢
Black. I like it.

355
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,190
老爸  我
Uh, hey, Dad, I, uh...

356
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,420
我想说
I-- I just got to say, um...

357
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,800
我只是想说
I-- I just wanted to say

358
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,360
有你在家真好
that it's really cool to have you here.

359
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,120
谢谢你  儿子
Thank you, son.

360
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,220
回家的感觉很好
It's cool to be back home.

361
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,820
感觉像是...
It just feels--

362
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,290
妈妈说你这周二会搬回来
Mom said you're moving back in, uh, this Tuesday.

363
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,320
她这么说的
She-- She said that?

364
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,620
是的
Yeah.

365
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,150
周二是吗
Tuesday, is it?

366
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,250
真是不错
How about that?

367
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,520
杰西
Jesse.

368
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,360
杰西
Jesse!

369
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,790
怎么了
Yo, what's up?

370
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,690
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

371
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,190
凿冰
Uh, breaking ice.

372
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,390
我是说  你在
I mean, what are you--

373
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,020
你怎么在这
what are you doing here?

374
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,190
你的车呢
Where's your car?

375
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,390
麦克载我来的
Mike dropped me off.

376
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,560
杰西
Jesse.

377
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,890
杰西
Jesse!

378
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,590
昨天发生了什么  你去哪儿了
What happened yesterday? Where were you?

379
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,490
我去陪麦克做交接
I was out with Mike helping him make pickups.

380
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,790
交接什么
Picking up what?

381
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,760
现金  还有货
Cash. Dead drops.

382
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,660
麦克去接货  我给他们放风
Mike made the pickups, and I guarded them.

383
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,560
你
You?

384
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,920
给麦克放风
Guarded Mike?

385
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,140
这是在开玩笑吗
What is this, some kind of a joke?

386
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,380
你知道吗  有两个人想打劫我们
Hey, you know what? Two dudes tried to rob us,

387
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,760
我引开了他们  为生意卖力
and I saved the stash. I took care of business,

388
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,830
就像我现在在为生意卖力一样
just like I'm taking care of business right now.

389
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,390
你是想站在那儿盘根问底
You want to stand there digging around,

390
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,960
还是换衣服干活
or you want to suit up and get to work?

391
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,580
你要想来的话  就换上行头
Get in gear, yo, if you want to do this

392
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,530
因为我下午要跟麦克出去
because I'm meeting up with Mike this afternoon.

393
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,830
又去  为什么
What, again? Why?

394
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,420
我想我想有两份工作了
Guess I have two jobs now.

395
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,120
洛丝・波罗斯・艾玛诺斯欢迎您
Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.

396
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,540
您要点什么
May I take your order?

397
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,530
受伤了吗
Any injuries?

398
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,690
脚踝扭了  其他没事
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

399
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,360
一切都如你所料
It all went like you thought it would,

400
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,660
大致如此
more or less.

401
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,630
当然  我会付给你
I will, of course, reimburse you

402
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,430
修车的钱
to the damage to your vehicle.

403
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,760
还有问题吗
Questions?

404
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,330
是有几个问题
Uh-huh. More than a few, yeah.

405
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,360
但我清楚还是不问为好
But I know better than to ask.

406
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,760
反正是如你所愿
Anyway, it was like you wanted.

407
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,590
那孩子立了大功
The kid's a hero.

408
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,810
收购洗车房的主意听起来不切实际
Just the idea of owning a car wash seems daunting,

409
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,160
可我必须鼓起勇气
but I had to warn myself--

410
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,960
谁才是世界上最美的女孩
Who is just the most beautiful little girl in the world?

411
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,830
我觉得那是你哦
I think it's you.

412
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,660
做这么一个
...so coming into a business like this

413
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,690
容易运营且全面运转的生意
that's up and running, fully operational,

414
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,200
让我们省去很多麻烦事
puts us way ahead of the game.

415
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,860
随着时间推移  我们仍然需要进行一些改变
You know, we're still going to have some change over time--

416
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,230
我们必须聘请一些员工
We have to hire some people

417
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,230
{\an8}(对婴孩说): 我认为是你哦  没错  就是你
I think it's you. Yeah, I do.

418
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,990
可员工仍然是一个重要因素
But we do have a staff in place,

419
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,990
幸运的是  我们能留住
so, you know, luckily, we'll be able to hold on

420
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,950
大部分以前博格丹的员工
to most of Bogdan's employees.

421
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,390
我们虽然还是会被另一边的极致洗车房给挖去一些
We might lose a few to the Ultra Wash across town, though.

422
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,090
我听说他们正在投机取巧
They're making a grab, I hear.

423
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,860
你们准备让孩子也投入工作
You going to put the kid to work?

424
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,890
我还得去上学
I got school.

425
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,920
我没说你
I'm not talking about you.

426
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,090
我在说你的妹妹
I'm talking about your baby sister.

427
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,760
我才不会让你洗我的车
I wouldn't let you near my car.

428
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,990
那可不失为一个好主意
Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.

429
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,460
你们应该把霍莉放在醒目位置
You should put Holly on the sign.

430
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,530
做个吉祥物
Like a mascot?

431
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,530
就像招牌宝宝一样
Like the Gerber baby.

432
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,460
要是我看到她那美丽的脸庞
I would get my car washed there every day

433
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,730
我会每天都在那洗车
if I saw her face out front.

434
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,860
那我呢
What about me?

435
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,610
我们可是在招揽生意
The goal is to bring customers in,

436
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,570
而不是吓跑他们
not scare them away, so--

437
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,560
沃尔特  厨房里还有一瓶
Walt, there's another bottle in the kitchen.

438
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,330
自己去拿吧
Just help yourself.

439
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,100
好的
Ah. Good.

440
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,320
也许我们该让汉克叔叔去体验一番
Uh, maybe we could roll Uncle Hank through the car wash.

441
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,590
他就能成为我们的第一个顾客
He could be the first customer.

442
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,260
洗车员工会把你洗的干干净净
The wipe-down crew would clean you up good.

443
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,560
看见这个了么  孩子
See this, son?

444
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,030
我现在就给你洗洗
I got your wipe-down right here, pal.

445
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,460
汉克  能不能好好吃顿饭
Hank, can you just maybe get through one meal

446
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,730
不说那些让人恶心的东西
without you saying something disgusting?

447
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,190
你们准备怎么带霍莉
So what are you going to do with Holly all day?

448
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,620
总不能带她去工作
You can't take her to work

449
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,290
那里可都是化学用品和非法移民
with all those chemicals and migrants hanging around.

450
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,290
玛丽
Marie--

451
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,860
真的  那可不安全
What? That can't be safe.

452
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,260
幸运的是
Fortunately, there is,

453
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,930
离洗车房5分钟路程的地方
just five minutes away from the car wash,

454
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,160
有个城里顶尖的托儿所
there is the top child care center in the city.

455
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,680
国家托儿协会
The National Child Care Association

456
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,320
给它的排名很高  这事也就迎刃而解了
gives it really high ratings, so that's quite a relief,

457
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,630
只需离开一会就能去接她
and, you know, it's just a walk away if we need it.

458
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,890
我得说
I got to tell you,

459
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,890
我真的很感动
I'm just-- I'm really, really impressed.

460
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,950
我是说  你们能一起筹办这事
I mean, you came together on this,

461
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,200
我很高兴你们能和好如初
and I'm really happy that it's working out for you.

462
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,090
多谢
Thanks.

463
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,160
这确实有点让人提心吊胆的
It was a little scary,

464
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,160
但事情必须得有个结果
but it, uh, needed to be done.

465
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,130
我们明天就能拿到钥匙了
And, uh, we get possession of the keys tomorrow.

466
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,560
那太棒了
Oh, that's awesome.

467
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,630
是的
Yeah.

468
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,960
等不急想知道你们会送我什么车作为生日礼物
I can't wait to see what kind of car I'll get for my birthday,

469
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,030
现在我们金钱可是滚滚而来
now with all this money rolling in.

470
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,890
我觉得你最近一直在
I think you've been spending too much time

471
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,160
开汉克叔叔的玩笑
around your uncle Hank.

472
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,960
人善被人欺
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

473
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,220
对吧  汉克叔叔
Right, Uncle Hank?

474
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,890
老实人可是你  老兄
Squeaky and greasy. That's you, my friend.

475
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,970
希腊人尼克
Hay, uh, Nick the Greek,

476
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,390
你还准不准被给我们喝
you going to share that bottle or what?

477
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,160
当然  抱歉
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

478
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,490
希腊人尼克是谁
Who's Nick the Greek?

479
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,730
希腊人尼克  他是世界上最著名的牌手
Nick the Greek. He was a famous big-time card player.

480
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,220
汉克  别开那玩笑
Hank, that's not funny.

481
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,560
怎么  那可是在表扬他
What? It's a compliment.

482
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,280
我听着可不像
Well, that's even worse, then.

483
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,440
你得用正面思想来表达
You're giving positive reinforcement to behavior

484
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,030
沃尔特是通过很努力的工作才换来的结局
that Walt is working very, very hard to change.

485
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,630
对吧  斯凯勒
Right, Skyler?

486
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,360
是的
Yeah.

487
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,960
我没看出这有什么不好的
I don't see how it's bad, Dad,

488
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,160
老爸只是在短时间内大赚了一把而已
just raking in the beaucoup bucks now.

489
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,860
我觉得我们该换个话题了
You know, I just, uh, think maybe we could change the subject?

490
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,530
好的  当然
Yeah. Sure. You know.

491
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,270
当然啦
Absolutely.

492
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:54,630
对了汉克叔叔  你正在查的那个
Hey, Uncle Hank, what about that case you were looking at

493
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,260
疯狂歌手的案子怎么样了
with that crazy singing guy?

494
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,660
我不查了
Ah, I'm off that.

495
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,040
我把我的看法反馈给阿尔布开克警方  然后完事了
I-- I gave my assessment to the APD, and I'm done.

496
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,830
疯狂歌手的案子
The case of the crazy singing guy. Hmm.

497
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,360
听上去像是《百科小布朗》里的故事
Sounds like an Encyclopedia Brown story, doesn't it?

498
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,360
{\an8}<i><font color="FFFF80">《百科小布朗》为儿童漫画侦探故事</i>

499
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,660
用疯狂来形容得不太准确
Crazy is-- is-- is, uh, is the wrong word.

500
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,530
这人叫盖尔・伯蒂彻
This guy Gale Boetticher,

501
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
他行为古怪
he was, uh, he was eccentric.

502
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,060
我是说  很有个性
I mean, a real character, you know?

503
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,190
现在已经死了
He's, uh, he's dead now, you know.

504
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,860
他是谁
Huh. Who was he?

505
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,830
他是制造冰毒的人
He was a meth cook.

506
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,960
他可是个冰毒大厨
Uh, he was a meth chef.

507
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,470
就像五星级饭店里一样
I mean, we're talking five stars--

508
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,530
蜡烛加上白桌布
candles and white tablecloths.

509
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,630
我不敢相信我会用这词来形容他
Hey, I can't believe these words are gonna come out of my mouth,

510
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,630
可他确确实实是个天才
but he was a genius, plain and simple.

511
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,000
我是说  要是能将那样的聪明才智
I mean, uh, boy, if you applied that big brain of his

512
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,740
用到好的地方
to something good, I don't know,

513
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,290
天知道那能帮助人类
who knows what could have helped humanity

514
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,560
取得多少成就
or something like that, you know?

515
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,430
天底下能有多少个天才呢
I mean, how many actual geniuses are there in the world, right?

516
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,130
要是他能致力于其他的事业
If he'd kind of taken his life in a different direction,

517
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,070
谁知道呢
who knows?

518
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,990
汉克  并不是对你指手画脚
Hank, not to tell you your business,

519
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,460
可我并不同意你的观点
but I'm not sure I agree.

520
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,690
什么意思
What do you mean?

521
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,990
我是说  你给我看的那个笔记本
Well, I mean, you showed me that notebook and from what I saw--

522
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,590
就我个人观点来看
and this is just my humble opinion--

523
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,260
就凭那些纸上写的东西
from what I saw on those papers...

524
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,390
天才么
genius?

525
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,630
还不够格
Not so much.

526
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,160
我是说  那上面没有推理的过程
I mean, there was no reasoning,

527
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,960
没有演绎的过程
no deductions in those pages.

528
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,130
以我看
To my eye,

529
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,170
你所谓的智慧
all this brilliance looks like nothing more

530
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,340
只不过是简单的抄袭而已
than just simple rote copying--

531
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,760
也许是别人的杰作
probably of someone else's work.

532
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,860
相信我  我身边这样的学生多的是
Believe me, I've been around enough students to know.

533
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:51,630
你所谓的那个天才
Ah, this genius of yours...

534
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,190
也许还逍遥法外
maybe he's still out there.

535
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,560
汉克
Hank.

536
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:09,790
你好  宝贝
Hey, babe.

537
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,030
提姆来过
Uh, Tim stopped by.

538
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,390
他带来了些案子的文件
He brought over some file boxes on that case.

539
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,430
觉得我应该再看看
Thought I'd take another peek.

540
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,830
不错啊
That's great.

541
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,830
抱歉把家里弄乱了
Sorry about the mess.

542
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,530
别  别  别  不要紧
No, no, no. Don't be.

543
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,290
要我给你泡杯咖啡吗
You want me to make some coffee?

544
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,060
好的
Yeah.

545
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,520
那样最好不过了
Yeah, that would be good.

546
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,430
发现什么了吗
You find something?

547
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,560
只是  我在调查的这个人
Oh, just this-- this guy I'm looking at.

548
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,070
他所买的  所吃的东西
You know, everything he-- he-- he buys and eats

549
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,090
都是有机的  没有非法交易  还是个素食主义者
is organic, fair trade, vegan.

550
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,170
什么时候素食主义者开始吃炸鸡了
Since when the vegan eat fried chicken.
