00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,039
烟和汽油
So cigarettes and gas is...

一共79块7
$79.70

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,004
该死
Crap.

4
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,002
外面有取款机
Oh, there's an ATM right outside.

5
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:57,020
我不用卡的
Yeah, I don't have a card.

6
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,035
你也可以用身份证号写一张支票
Well, you can write a personal check with I.D.

7
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:03,092
不大方便呢
Kind of in between banks right now.

8
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:08,043
我等下来行吗
You think I could just come back later?

9
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:10,060
我肯定会回来的
I'm totally good for it. I'd come back.

10
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:11,067
我保证
I swear.

11
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:16,022
如果我能做主
If it were me, I'd be,

12
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:18,012
我会说  当然可以
"Totally, you know, no problem."

13
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:20,093
但我爸这人不好说话
But my dad is this ginormous hard---.

14
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:22,070
他在费卢杰[伊拉克城市]呆了一年
He was in Fallujah for a year,

15
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:24,077
他总是会检查收据
And he always checks the receipts.

16
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,072
总是会
I mean, like...always.

17
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:29,045
抱歉  我得去问他
I've got to call him. I'm sorry.

18
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:30,089
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

19
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:33,063
等一下
Hold-- Hold on a second.

20
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,081
也许我们可以
Maybe if we could, um...

21
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:40,035
做笔交易
trade.

22
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:49,000
试过这个吗
Ever try it?

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,004
我有时会吸大麻
I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.

24
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:55,008
在派对上
I party.

25
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:58,089
但这东西真会上瘾的  对吗
But-- But that stuff's really addictive, right?

26
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:03,077
其实不是  只是媒体宣传  明白吗
Not really. It's just a media thing. You know?

27
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,038
是什么感觉
What's it like?

28
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:15,096
棒极了
It's awesome.

29
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,091
让你觉得一切都非常有趣
Everything's maximum interesting.

30
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:25,031
你会有种冷冷的
You get these really cold

31
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:29,092
清爽的  像针刺一样的感觉
and sharp-like action dagger feelings.

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,033
棒极了
It's awesome.

33
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:39,097
怎么样  怎么说
Come on. What do you say?

34

疼吗
Does it hurt?

51

52
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:03,035
痛苦吗
Okay, but is it painful?

53
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:05,012
让我窒息
It's hard to breathe.

54
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:08,012
你还是得呼吸的
Well, you need your breathing.

55
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,005
好吧
Uh, well--

56
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:12,002
让我们搞清楚状况
Although let's not lose sight of the fact

57
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,062
安东尼  你是一起严重事故的受害者
That you were the victim of a terrible accident, Antonio,

58
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:17,006
有小小的不舒服是正常的
So some discomfort is to be expected.

59
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,070
我们就这样吧
Let's go with that one.

60
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:29,097
女士  很高兴见到你

请去结账吧

63
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:34,044
另外请把消息传出去
Oh, and spread the word.

64
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:37,041
我会就515航班提起集体诉讼
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

65
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,038
原告不仅包括受害者家庭
Victims' families would be great,

66
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,058
还会囊括所有地面上
But I'll take anyone on he ground

67
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,011
受到精神创伤的人

68
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,055
比如焦虑  失眠  你能想象的
Anxiety, sleeplessness, you get the picture.

69
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,058
有麻烦
Trouble?

70
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,052
泰德·贝内克  不是吧
Ted Beneke? You cannot be serious.

71
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:51,069
就凭那个可笑的家伙
That guy is a joke.

72
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,086
你知道吗  沃尔特
You know what, Walt?

73
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,002
是你逼我这么做的
You know what? You called my bluff.

74
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:55,076
我逼你  什么意思
I called your-- What does that even mean?

75
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,036
你仗着我不会向警察告发你
You dared me to tell the police,

76
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,039
我无法这么做  你赢了
And I couldn't do it, so you win.

77
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:01,010
如果你想呆在这  没问题
If you want to stay in this house, fine,

78
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:02,086
但我们不再是夫妻
But we are not married anymore.

79
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,037
我跟你说过我已经不制毒了  斯凯勒
I told you that I was done cooking meth, Skyler.

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,070
我向你发过誓
Oh, right. I promised you that.

81
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,024
那又怎样
And so what?

82
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:10,017
起码我没有去
At least I didn't run off to go--

83
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,064
天啊  要知道我做的一切
Jesus! I mean, everything that I did

84
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,007
都是为了这个家
I did for this family.

85
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:15,071
你就自欺欺人吧
Oh, yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.

86
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:17,048
那又是什么意思
Oh, and what is that supposed to mean?

87
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,031
你不喜欢吗  你可以走
You don't like it? Then leave

88
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,018
把你那些赃钱也带走
And take your drug money with you.

89
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:24,021
这才是你的目的吧
That's what you want.

90
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:26,002
老天
Jesus.

91
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:27,092
她把钱冲掉了
Garbage disposal.

92
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,095
你觉得这样就能让我搬走吗
You think this will get me to move out?

93
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,042
你可以搞泰德
You can screw Ted.

94
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:33,066
搞屠夫  搞邮递员
You can screw the butcher, the mailman,

95
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,076
谁都行
Whoever you want.

96
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,079
你就乱搞吧
Screw them all.

97
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,023
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

98
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:38,026
很好  那你自便吧
Good. Suit yourself.

99
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:42,010
这是好事还是坏事
Is this a good or bad thing?

100
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:45,043
你让我自便
You want me to suit myself?

101
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:48,033
我要当着他的面方便
I'll suit myself to his face!

102
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:50,004
坏事
It's a bad thing.

103
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,011
你好

120
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,067
怎么样
How about that?

121

泰德  就现在  开门
Open the door, Ted, right now.

126
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,075
你不想像个爷们一样解决问题是吧
All right, you don't want to be a man about it? Okay.

127
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,079
我还有备用计划  这个怎么样

你到底是怎么想的
What the hell is wrong with you?

145
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,052
你以为你是第一个遇到这事的人吗
You act like you're the first guy this ever happened to.

146
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:55,069
我曾把我第二任妻子和我继父捉奸在床
I caught my second wife screwing my stepdad, okay?

147
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:58,096
世界本来就是残酷的  沃尔特  成熟点
It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.

148
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,017
我只想跟他谈谈
I just wanted to talk to him.

149
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,030
那我先跟你谈谈
Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

150
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:05,010
把这事当成个小插曲
Consider this an intervention.

151
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:07,067
你很有可能为此事而被捕  你懂我意思
You could have been arrested back there. You understand.

152
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,051
我的意思是  作为你的律师
I mean, speaking as your lawyer,

153
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:11,051
我当然很期待按小时计算薪酬
I'm always looking for billable hours,

154
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,088
但作为你的商业伙伴
but speaking as your business associate,

155
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:15,011
我强烈的建议你
I'm strongly advising

156
00:09:15,015 --> 00:09:16,095
振作起来
that you get your shit together.

157
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:20,098
别去理那个姓贝内克的  最起码现在别
Just cool it with this Beneke guy, at least for now.

158
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,042
我们来谈点生意上的事
Let's talk shop

159
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,039
我认为这是个很好的机遇
because I think this is a great opportunity

160
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,072
把消极能量转化为
to channel some of that negative energy

161
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:31,036
积极能量
into something positive.

162
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,013
你是怎么知道的
How did you know?

163
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:34,049
什么
Sorry?

164
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,089
斯凯勒的事
About Skyler.

165
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,046
还有刚才是怎么找到我的
About where to find me just now.

166
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,040
你是怎么知道的
How did you know?

167
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:41,027
那完全是由于我的谨小慎微
That's just my meticulousness.

168
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,077
别钻牛角尖  沃尔特
Don't bog down in detail, Walt.

169
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,084
我的经验是
The lesson here--

170
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:46,074
你在我家装窃听器了吗
Did you bug my house?

171
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:53,009
是的  但我不确定那还是不是你家
Yeah, but I didn't know it was your house,

172
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,034
不是吗  你搬出去了
did I? You had moved out.

173
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:56,024
另外  也算是你让我这么做的
Besides, you basically told me to.

174
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,061
我让你做的
I told you to?

175
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,045
你曾强烈的暗示我这么做
You strongly hinted that I should.

176
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,056
你很担心你的妻子  还记得吗
You were worried about your wife, remember?

177
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:03,095
你很担心她会不会跟警察说些什么
You were concerned she might say something to the police.

178
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:06,009
什么  不  不  不是这样的
What? No, no, that's not true.

179
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:08,042
我什么时候说过这样的话
When the hell did I say that?

180
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:11,036
我们别在纠结谁在什么时候说了什么
Let's not get lost in the who, what, and whens.

181
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,036
关键在于我们尽职尽责调查了
The point is we did our due diligence,

182
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,086
她什么都没说
and she didn't talk.

183
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,086
她保持沉默了
She kept quiet.

184
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,097
她站在你这边  沃尔特
She stood by you, Walt,

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,007
如果你问我的话
which, if you ask me,

186
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,060
具讽刺意味的是还有一线希望
is the ironical silver lining here.

187
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:23,091
我的意思是  一方面
I mean, on the one hand,

188
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:27,028
当然  她背地里偷腥
sure, she snuck off the reservation

189
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:28,098
搞那些肮脏的  湿漉漉的  邪恶的事
to get some dirty, damp, and deep.

190
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,091
另一方面呢
On the other hand--

191
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:49,049
我炒你鱿鱼  你玩完了
You're fired! You're done!

192
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:52,030
好啊  呜呜  我不再制毒了
Good. Oh, boo-hoo, I won't cook meth anymore.

193
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:54,020
你就是个爱哭包  谁需要你啊
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?

194
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,018
嘿  我现在就停掉那个网址
Hey, I'm unplugging the Web site,

195
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:58,013
你觉得怎么样
How do you like that?

196
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:01,017
我现在就要你拔掉那些窃听器
I want those bugs out of my house today.

197
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,003
我要它们立刻拔除
I want them out now!

198
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:06,077
你刚买一套300块钱的西服  疯子
Oh, you just bought a $300 suit, psycho!

199
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:18,088
好极了  直接钻进水泥墙里
Great, drilled right into the stucco.

200
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:23,014
只是一点灰泥
Oh, a little bit of putty,

201
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:24,043
就给填上了
you'll be fine.

202
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,058
保证要把所有窃听器都拔了
Just make sure you get all of those things.

203
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:32,088
第一  这个小东西一个要800块钱
A, these things cost $800 apiece.

204
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,072
第二  你也没那么重要
B, you're not that interesting.

205
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:37,032
所以  我会把他们全都拔了的  沃尔特
So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.

206
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:41,036
顺便说一句  手艺不错
Great line of work, by the way.

207
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,053
如果用在正地方的话
Real upstanding field.

208
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:45,056
呵呵
Yep, well...

209
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,080
我喜欢做这事
I enjoy it.

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,041
你现在可以走了  随时
You're free to leave now. Anytime.

211
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:06,014
你知道吗  沃尔特
You know, Walter,

212
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:09,085
有时候被别人监视并不是坏事
sometimes it doesn't hurt to have someone watching your back.

213
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:30,015
怀特老师
Mr. White?

214
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,006
我现在有点不明白
I can't begin to understand

215
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,048
你到底经历了些什么  沃尔特
what you're going through, Walt,

216
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:51,028
你的健康问题
with all of your health concerns

217
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:54,075
和你所承受的压力
and the stresses you've been under.

218
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,082
但是  作为一名施教者
Still, as educators,

219
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,055
我们需要在这儿谈一谈是
there are certain responsibilities

220
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,055
我们对待学校和学生
we need to be meeting here

221
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,076
要有一定的责任心的
to the school and to the students themselves.

222
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,082
是的  当然
Yeah, of course.

223
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:10,023
这只是爱尔兰软毛梗吗
Is this a Wheaten terrier?

224
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,013
是诺福克梗
Uh, Norfolk.

225
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,020
诺福克梗
Norfolk?

226
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:17,089
真出人意料
That's surprising.

227
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:21,070
沃尔特  你能过来一下
Walt, could you come back over here

228
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,027
坐下来吗
and have a seat, please?

229
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,021
当然
Sure.

230
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:40,022
最近你长时间缺课
You've been absent a lot recently,

231
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,095
但你回到学校后
and when you are here at school,

232
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:45,042
在行为方面表现出一些问题
there have been some behavioral questions,

233
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:47,029
实话说我很担心
and frankly I'm concerned.

234
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:52,043
恩  多谢
Hm. Thank you.

235
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:03,031
你还好吗
Are you feeling okay?

236
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:07,058
你觉得我应该叫斯凯勒过来一趟吗
And do you think maybe I should call Skyler?

237
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:20,092
让我们保持这种
Let's just keep this...

238
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,059
什么
What?

239
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,033
沃尔特  你是不是有毛病
Walt, what's wrong with you?

240
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:12,057
你看  听着
You know, look,

241
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,047
是你一直在谈论着华盛顿的
you're the one who was talking about D.C., okay?

242
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,027
一路谈到这来的
This is how you get there.

243
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:19,071
你既然说了  就得接受结果
You answer the bell. You pay your dues.

244
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:24,074
另外  你知道的
Besides, it's-- you know,

245
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,055
被选去是件大事
it's a big deal to get picked for this.

246
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:32,052
去埃尔帕索就像参加超级碗杯
El Paso's like the Super Bowl.

247
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,014
我很有可能过个马路就被宰了
I could get killed crossing the street, okay?

248
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:41,073
不管怎样  我想去
Whatever. You know, I want to go.

249
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,043
那上次的事怎么说
What about last time?

250
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:44,086
上次怎么了
What about last time?

251
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,092
我是施拉德
Schrader.

252
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,076
嘿  警长
Hey, Sheriff. Yeah.

253
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:16,090
蓝的哈
Blue, huh?

254
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:23,004
事情是  恩
Thing is, uh--

255
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,004
我现在应该立刻上飞机的
Thing is I'm supposed to be getting on a plane right now.

256
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:32,028
那家伙拿着的是蓝色的
The stuff this guy had was blue.

257
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,015
你确定吗
You sure about that?

258
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,012
是的  我想跟他谈谈
Yeah, I want to talk to him.

259
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,039
出租车
Taxi.

260
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:28,060
伙计  很抱歉  我得跟你谈谈
Man, I'm sorry. I needed to talk to you,

261
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:31,040
但你不在公寓
but you weren't at your apartment.

262
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,037
对  我搬回家了
No, I moved back home.

263
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,084
这很好  不是吗
That's good, right?

264
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,001
是的
Yeah.

265
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,075
唷  你这是被开除了吗
Yo, did you just get fired?

266
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:46,058
没有  这更像是个休假吧
No. No, no, no, it's, uh... more like a sabbatical.

267
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:49,072
尚未确定  是的
Indefinite. Yeah.

268
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:07,044
最近怎么样
So what's up?

269
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:09,001
我们要先去什么地方再聊吗
Uh, should we go somewhere?

270
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,088
不用了  这里就挺好的
No. This is fine.

271
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:18,098
我想让你把我介绍给你的人
So, um, I want an intro to your guy.

272
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:20,015
什么人
What guy?

273
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:24,002
你的人  你的经销商
Your guy. Your distribution guy,

274
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,036
索尔让你们一起合作的那个人
the guy Saul hooked you up with.

275
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,099
不  不  杰西  别这样
No, no, no, no, no. Come on, Jesse.

276
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:31,046
我好好想过了  我想要制毒
I thought about it, and I want to.

277
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,009
这是我唯一擅长的事情
It's the one thing I'm good at.

278
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:36,096
不对  不是这样的
No, that is just not true.

279
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:39,001
你擅长很多事情  小子
You're good at a lot of things, son.

280
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,065
比如什么呢
Like what?

281
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:46,006
比如你很节制
What about your sobriety?

282
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:51,037
我跟你说过  我永远不会再吸了
I told you. I'm not using. Ever.

283
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:54,089
我就是想要重新开始做生意
I just want back into the business.

284
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,090
好吧  可我不想
Well, I don't.

285
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:02,056
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,057
我理解  那样很好
I know, and that's cool.

287
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,001
我不是想让你制毒
I'm not asking you to cook.

288
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,069
这是什么
What's this?

289
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:18,046
我最终就只有两个回流冷凝器了
In the end, I just went with two reflux condensers.

290
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,086
我也不想搞混了酸碱值
I didn't want to lose track of my Ph levels,

291
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,054
可是我做了你教我的所有事情
but I did everything else just like you taught me.

292
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,074
在数值上非常小心
Super careful in my amounts

293
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:30,037
而且在制作过程中的每一步
and watched the numbers

294
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:31,044
我都检查过数值
every step of the way.

295
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,098
你认为怎么样呢
So what do you think?

296
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,068
这很不错  对吧
It's good, right?

297
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:43,098
这里面是什么鬼东西
What in the hell is this?

298
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:46,055
什么
What?

299
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,075
什么  这个  就这个
What? This. This.

300
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,069
这是我的产品
This is my product.

301
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:51,082
这是我的配方
This is my formula.

302
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:53,039
这是我的
This is mine.

303
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,053
好吧  这是我们的产品
Okay, it's our product,

304
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,019
不过是的  我正准备让你加入我呢
but yeah, I was going to cut you in.

305
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,070
你想让我加入你
You were going to cut me in?

306
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:02,000
不对  不对  是我让你入伙
No, no, no. I cut you in.

307
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:03,053
你有什么毛病啊
What the hell is your problem?

308
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:06,037
我只是想让你帮我约见经销商而已
All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

309
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,064
绝对不可能
Absolutely not.

310
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,010
为什么
Why?

311
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:13,014
因为我才不会让如此拙劣的产品
Because I am not going to lend my name

312
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:14,064
标榜上我的名号
to an inferior product.

313
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:17,004
我是说  你看看这直径
I mean, look at the diameters here.

314
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:18,091
你是用什么来进行还原反应的
What did you use for reduction?

315
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:22,005
先别说  二氧化铂  对吧
Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?

316
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:25,042
不是  是汞铝合金
No. Mercury-aluminum amalgam.

317
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:27,065
二氧化铂很难保持潮湿
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.

318
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,022
好吧  那你肯定哪里弄错了
All right, well, you must've done it wrong, then.

319
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:33,005
你的产品颜色都很浑浊
Your color is all cloudy,

320
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:35,029
所以你在蒸馏的时候也一定有什么问题
so you were struggling with distillation, too.

321
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:38,023
这是个非常次的次品  平克曼
Now, this is very shoddy work, Pinkman.

322
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:40,013
我都替你感到脸红
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

323
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,034
什么
What?

324
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:45,006
不可能  我散发了样品的
No way. I gave out samples,

325
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,063
每个人都说这个非常棒
and everyone said it was the bomb.

326
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:50,040
哦  他们说这非常棒哈
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

327
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:52,030
那他们是些什么人  我想知道
And who are they? I wonder.

328
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,070
啊  一群对冰毒上瘾的人吗
Huh? A bunch of meth heads?

329
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:55,027
-是  -是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

330
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,051
他们是懂的  对吗
They should know, right?

331
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:57,054
是的  好吧  对不起了
Yeah, well, sorry.

332
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:58,064
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

333
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,098
无所谓  老顽固
Fine, ass ward.

334
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,008
你知道吗  我会自己去和那个人联系的
You know what? I'll contact the guy myself.

335
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:04,091
那祝你好运了  因为那人可是个专业人士
Good luck with that because my guy is a pro,

336
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:06,061
他才不会和一个吸毒的人交易
and he doesn't deal with junkies.

337
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:08,015
你知道吗  有种就来啊
You know what? Eat me.

338
00:22:08,018 --> 00:22:11,048
随时  失败者  嘿  嘿
Anytime, loser. Hey. Hey!

339
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,008
等下  嘿
Wait. Hey!

340
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:55,037
真不敢相信这才四点而已
I can't believe it's only 4:00.

341
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,037
今天好漫长啊
This day is dragging.

342
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,061
我真想留下来
I wish I could stay.

343
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:42,012
那就留下来吧
So stay.

344
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:47,066
什么事让你没办法留下啊
What's stopping you?

345
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,030
什么  你是说所有的事情吗
What? Like everything, you mean?

346
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:56,002
那就说说我的疯子丈夫
How about my lunatic husband

347
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:58,070
拒绝从家里搬出去怎样
refusing to leave the house?

348
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,081
那就搬过来住吧
So move in here.

349
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:07,001
那样的话我儿子会更加讨厌我
And then my son hating me even more.

350
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:08,081
才不会呢
Nah.

351
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:10,008
都会过去的
That'll pass.

352
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:11,081
我经历这些事情的时候和女儿们在一起
I went through that with the girls.

353
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,068
她们适应的不错
They adapt.

354
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:15,073
而现在同事们都觉得
And now everyone at work thinks

355
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:18,042
我是个邪恶的想升职的婊子
I'm an evil, ladder-climbing whore.

356
00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:20,029
他们都被开除了  即刻生效
They're all fired effective immediately.

357
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:22,022
还有什么
What else?

358
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:26,083
你不就是精神导师吗
Oh, aren't you the answer man.

359
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,083
哪里
Where did it--

360
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:39,081
你和沃尔特之间究竟出什么问题了
where did it go wrong, exactly-- you and Walt?

361
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:46,079
我是说  我看他还是挺...
I mean, I always saw him as kind of...

362
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,026
温柔的
mild-mannered.

363
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,036
是他得病后有了什么变化吗  还是
Something, I don't know, change when he got sick, or...?

364
00:24:58,053 --> 00:25:01,040
我也不知道是什么变了  泰德
I don't know what changed, Ted,

365
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:04,097
我真的很不想谈论这个事情
and I just don't feel really comfortable talking about it.

366
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,004
抱歉
Sorry.

367
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:10,064
就是出于私心才问的
Just asking out of self-interest.

368
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:12,054
想要确保我不会犯同一个错误
Got to make sure I don't make the same mistake.

369
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:17,055
会的话我会很惊讶的
I would be amazed.

370
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:23,002
看看我是不是理解对了  拉塞尔
Just let me see if I'm following you here, Russell.

371
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:28,008
你从Gasparza里的一个穿着棕黄色裤子的人
You got this stuff from some guy at Gasparza's

372
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:29,082
手里得到了这个东西
who was wearing tan pants

373
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:34,050
你有80%的信心肯定他是有胡子的
and who you're 80% sure had a mustache.

374
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:35,097
就这样  对吗
That's it, right?

375
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,094
这就是你的大脑尽全力工作的结果了吗
That's your brain working at maximum capacity?

376
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:47,082
拉塞尔
Russell.

377
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:50,075
没事吧
Everything all right in there?

378
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:56,062
梅尔  那小子叫梅尔
Mel. The dude's name was Mel.

379
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:58,095
好啊  这就对了  看到了吗
Well, there you go. See?

380
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,052
你还是有些用处的
You served an actual earthly function.

381
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:03,052
真不敢相信我还记得那个
I can't believe I remembered that.

382
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:05,013
叫梅尔什么
Mel who?

383
00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:07,086
记得他姓什么吗
Does he have a last name?

384
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,096
是的  梅尔
Yeah, uh, Mel.

385
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,007
等下
Wait.

386
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,067
是梅尔么
Was it Mel?

387
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,027
恩  叫马克吧
Um...Mark.

388
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,064
肯定是以个"M"开头的一个名字
It was definitely an "M" Name.

389
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:23,074
天哪  我就要忘掉了
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

390
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:25,068
等等  等等
Wait, wait.

391
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:29,031
是的
Yeah.

392
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:32,038
我忘掉了
It's gone.

393
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:34,091
忘掉了
It's gone.

394
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:37,014
不过是个以"M"开头的名字
It was an "M" name, though.

395
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:40,004
我记得那是个"麽"的发音
I remember the "Muh" Sound.

396
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:42,018
哦  啊
Oh. Huh?

397
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:45,091
我们就找名字开头发"麽"音的
We'll go with the "Muh" sound.

398
00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:46,091
多谢
Thanks a lot.

399
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:47,091
谢谢
Yeah.

400
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:50,011
他穿的肯定是黄褐色裤子
He definitely had tan pants.

401
00:26:53,048 --> 00:26:55,035
我想阉了自己
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

402
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,082
好  现在9点多
Okay, it's after 9,

403
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:58,065
乔治女孩驻唱的那家酒吧
so this bar that Girl George is at,

404
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:00,076
这时大概遍地人渣了
probably wall-to-wall dirtbags by now.

405
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,032
咱去瞧瞧热闹
Let's go have a little looky-loo,

406
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:05,043
看能不能找到那M打头的家伙
see if we can't find this M-named clown.

407
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:10,063
怎么了
What?

408
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,093
这是条线索
It's a lead.

409
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,037
什么线索
Lead to what?

410
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,000
能找到海森堡的线索
To Heisenberg.

411
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:16,044
早和你说过就是个时间问题
I told you it was only a matter of time

412
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:18,057
这家伙肯定憋不住的
before this guy booted up again.

413
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,084
走吧  伙计
Here we go, my friend.

414
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:22,084
格米  别怨我运气好
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful, Gomie.

415
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:24,094
道个歉再请我喝一杯  就完事了
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

416
00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:29,005
老兄  你太过了
Man, you're reaching.

417
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:31,010
那玩意可能是别人做的
This stuff could be a knockoff

418
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,035
或者是那老家伙剩下的
or left over from an older cook.

419
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:35,032
你凭什么就认为海森堡又重现江湖了
How do you know Heisenberg's gearing up again?

420
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:39,025
凭什么
How do I know?

421
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,079
因为我就是知道
Because I know.

422
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:43,046
反正我不信
I don't get it.

423
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:46,096
你就为这把任务小组派出去的么
This is the reason why you're blowing off the task force?

424
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,026
就为查那几个臭小子
Chase down teeners?

425
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,000
最讨厌你们这些马后炮了
I'm getting tired of all the second guessing.

426
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:56,073
你要觉得这次调查缺少刺激的话
If you're not sufficiently stimulated by this investigation,

427
00:27:56,077 --> 00:27:59,010
行行好  快调走得了
do us both a favor and ask for a transfer.

428
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:01,074
你最近什么毛病
What is up with you lately?

429
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:03,067
在酒吧打架
Starting bar fights?

430
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,064
拒绝去埃尔帕索
Turning down El Paso?

431
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,011
现在又是这些屁话
And now this bullshit?

432
00:28:07,014 --> 00:28:09,048
我看你需要找人谈谈了
Do you need to talk to someone or what?

433
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:13,025
找人谈
Talk to someone?

434
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:14,068
找谁
Talk to who?

435
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:22,089
伙计  我不想触怒你
I'm not trying to step on your toes, bro. Okay?

436
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:25,052
我是为你担心  没其它的
I'm just worried about you. That's all.

437
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:28,016
领教了  "伙计"
Appreciate that...bro.

438
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:32,026
现在把你手从我身上拿开
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

439
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,070
我就是电视上那个人
Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.

440
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:52,007
有什么小零碎儿掉在你家吗
Did any little piece fall on your property?

441
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:55,034
林卡斯先生  我不是找整个的机翼
I'm not looking for an entire wing here, Mr. Linkas.

442
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:56,088
也许就是个螺丝或者螺帽
It could be a nut or a bolt.

443
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:58,061
还可能是点极小的玩意
It could be a bag of peanuts,

444
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:01,071
只要这空难还让继续你纠结的话
just so long as it caused you pain and suffering.

445
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:03,028
别进来  把门关上
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.

446
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:04,035
我回头打给你
Uh, calling you back.

447
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:06,035
机会已经给你了
You had your chance.

448
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,098
跟你说要让他接着搞
I told you to get him cooking again,

449
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:09,058
可你却搞砸了  现在晚了
and you blew it off, and now it's too late.

450
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:11,095
那家伙现在冲我们大发神经
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

451
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,059
本来我是想让你们爷俩发光发热
All I wanted was to show you two your potential,

452
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:15,089
可我现在又得到了个屁
and what do I get in return?

453
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:18,039
反而是骨折  瞧瞧我这伤
A bone contusion. You want to see the scar?

454
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:20,029
就希望你俩...
I wish you two had--

455
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,016
这个...
Hi, there.

456
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:25,003
你是你怎么让沃尔特...
How in the hell did you get Walt to--

457
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:26,097
我自己搞出来的
I made it.

458
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,040
你以为只有他能做
You know the guy who knows the guy, right?

459
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:07,017
好消息是对于一个晚期癌症患者来说
Uh, good news is, for a stage three cancer,

460
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:09,054
他事情做得的确不错
the guy's doing well physically.

461
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,058
精神上却...
Mentally,

462
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:12,014
彻底失败
the guy's a disaster.

463
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,078
他跟他老婆坦诚了这事
He's gone off the rails over this thing with his wife.

464
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:18,062
我看他不会再干了
My opinion, he's not coming back,

465
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:20,075
反正自己是不干了
not on his own.

466
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:27,076
还有  你那些朋友又找他去了
Your friends were at his place again, by the way.

467
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,036
在他家外面的路上画上了些东西
They drew something on the street outside his house.

468
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:33,010
大镰刀
The scythe.

469
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,047
这帮畜生
Animals.

470
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,097
-律师知道了吗  -该让他知道吗
- Does the lawyer know? - Should he?

471
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,058
不
No.

472
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:43,035
你要还想让他再制毒的话
If you want this guy to produce again,

473
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,096
干嘛不跟他说呢
why not just tell him?

474
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:47,076
你是唯一一个多少还在维护他的人
You're the only thing that stands between him and an ax in the head.

475
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,009
恐惧可不是有效的动力
I don't believe fear to be an effective motivator.

476
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:52,033
我要他全身心投入
I want investment.

477
00:30:52,036 --> 00:30:56,023
我眼下只对他能活多久感兴趣
For now, I'm simply interested in time frame.

478
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:58,060
他不会死的太快吧
He will live for the foreseeable future, yes?

479
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:00,057
没错
Mm, foreseeable,

480
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
至少有几年吧
couple years at least,

481
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:04,084
不考虑天灾人祸的话
barring acts of God and men with axes.

482
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:07,064
律师告诉我
Oh, from the lawyer,

483
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:09,014
应该让你知道
I'm supposed to let you know

484
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:11,078
平克曼小子正找机会出手呢
the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

485
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:13,061
我不跟嗑药的搅在一起
I don't work with junkies.

486
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:15,055
想你也会这么说
That's what I thought you'd say.

487
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:17,058
可能这样最稳妥
Probably for the best.

488
00:31:17,062 --> 00:31:20,005
听说他和沃尔特单飞了
What I hear, he and Walter are splitsville.

489
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:23,015
有这事
Really?

490
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,062
古德曼说的
That's what Goodman says.

491
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:26,076
谁知道呢
Cats and dogs.

492
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:30,022
按计划办吧
Do the deal.

493
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,083
您有一条未接留言
You have one unheard message.

494
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,014
施拉德探员
Agent Schrader,

495
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,091
尽快给我回电
you need to be calling me back ASAP.

496
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:08,044
我感觉整个德州都在盯着我  我就没...
I've got Texas breathing down my neck, and I'm not about--

497
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,021
马特上周被炒后就没见过
Yeah, I haven't see Matt since he got fired last week.

498
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:36,080
你看我该去哪儿找他
Where can I find him, you think?

499
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:38,081
不知道   我没见过他...
No idea. I haven't seen him--

500
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:40,034
行了  你都说好几遍了
I know. You said that a few times.

501
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:42,031
可我就是没见过他啊
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.

502
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:43,084
我不知道还能说什么
I don't know what else to say.

503
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,052
亲爱的  你叫什么
What's your name, darling?

504
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:52,008
卡拉
Cara.

505
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:59,086
卡拉  这玩意从哪儿来的
Where did this come from, Cara?

506
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:02,089
我...我不知道
I-- I don't know.

507
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:06,016
这是...毒品吗
What is it? Drugs?

508
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:11,023
听着  我刚才就想说了
Look, I'm just going to come right out and say it.

509
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:15,034
卡拉  你骗人还嫩点
Um, you're a bad liar, Cara.

510
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:17,067
别跟我扯
Don't get me wrong.

511
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:19,034
比这糟糕的我见多了
Not the worst I've ever seen.

512
00:34:20,065 --> 00:34:24,042
有次抓到一个肛门藏着毒囊的家伙
Once had a guy try to explain the dope balloon up his butt

513
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:25,075
楞说那是什么泰餐
on bad Thai food.

514
00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:29,055
所以你骗人还真不行
Still, you're not a very good liar.

515
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,056
我真的不知道
I honestly don't know

516
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:34,039
够了
Stop.

517
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:36,049
你看着像个好姑娘
You look like a good kid.

518
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:37,093
我到这不是找你麻烦的
I'm not here to get you in trouble,

519
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:41,013
不过你得赶紧告我这东西从哪儿来
but you need to tell me where this came from right now!

520
00:34:45,037 --> 00:34:48,077
我发誓从没做过这东西
I never do stuff like this. I swear to God.

521
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:53,068
我尝过点  难受死了  所以就给了马特
I tried it, and I hated it, so I just gave it to Matt.

522
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,004
谁给你的
Okay, and who gave it to you?

523
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:57,048
有个人几天前来的
Some guy, he came in a couple days ago

524
00:34:57,051 --> 00:35:00,012
拿这个跟我换过汽油
and wanted to trade it for gas.

525
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,005
有个人  叫什么
Some guy? W-What's his name?

526
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:05,039
算了
Okay, w--

527
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:06,066
他长什么样儿
What did he look like?

528
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:11,036
我不知道  不过...
I don't know. Um--

529
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,050
大众脸
He looked pretty normal.

530
00:35:13,053 --> 00:35:17,060
白种人
You know? Um, white--

531
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:23,030
我记得他的头发有点淡棕色
I think his hair was lightish brown.

532
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:25,094
眼睛很蓝
He had really blue eyes.

533
00:35:25,097 --> 00:35:29,048
碧蓝碧蓝的那种
They were really, really blue.

534
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:32,011
他很迷人  还有呢
He's dreamy. Okay, w-w-what else?

535
00:35:32,015 --> 00:35:33,081
身上是否有刺青  佩戴何首饰
Piercings,jewelry,

536
00:35:33,085 --> 00:35:35,038
着装风格呢
distinctive articles of clothing?

537
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,012
好好想想
Come on.

538
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:38,068
快想想
Come on.

539
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:41,062
听我说
Listen to me.

540
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:43,092
找到这个贩毒男
It's real important

541
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:46,086
真的很重要
that I find the person that had these drugs,

542
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:49,048
你能否回忆起其他细节
so if you can remember anything else about him...

543
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,030
好好想想
Come on.

544
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,011
快想想
Come on.

545
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,078
快点想
Come on.

546
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,057
他开一辆旅行房车
He drove an RV.

547
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,087
很好  很好
Okay, good, good.

548
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:04,027
还记得什么  车型怎样
What can you remember? What kind of RV?

549
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:06,044
何种颜色  看到过车牌吗
What color? Did you spot a license plate?

550
00:36:07,074 --> 00:36:10,001
我不知道车型
I don't know the kinds,

551
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:13,075
也没看到车牌
and I didn't see the license,

552
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:18,069
但颜色  我记得是白褐相间
but the color was, I think, white, brownish color.

553
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,049
对不起
I'm sorry.

554
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:27,036
我知道没能帮到你
I know I'm not helping you, but...

555
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,007
请别告诉我爸爸
Please don't tell my dad.

556
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:40,067
卡拉
Cara.

557
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:46,050
这摄像头还在运作吧
Please tell me that that camera works.

558
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:02,057
该死
Damn it.

559
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,027

谢谢
Thanks.

562
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:29,029
最近有点奇怪
Hey, you know what's weird?

563
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:30,099
老爸的筹款网站
Dad's Web site.

564
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:34,006

It's been three days since the last donation.

565
00:38:36,006 --> 00:38:39,013

Yeah, well...

566
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,067
大家都没兴趣了
people lose interest.

567
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:57,084
你打算休息多久
So how long are you off for?

568
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,065
几个星期
A few weeks.

569
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:06,078
视情况而定吧
Uh, we'll play it by ear.

570
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:14,009
我可能太急进了点
I probably... pushed it, you know,

571
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:15,089
这么快就重返岗位了
going back to work so soon.

572
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:27,003
那我今天能搭个车吗
Think-- Think I can get a ride today?

573
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:29,016
路易斯去看医生了
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

574
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,060
可以
Uh...yeah.

575
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:42,077
那么爸爸可以照看妹妹了  对吧
Hey, so dad can babysit now. Right?

576
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:47,095
你不会想天天都把霍莉带去公司吧
You won't have to take Holly to work every day.

577
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:59,012
总会有机会
Sometime, maybe.

578
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:02,099
看看再说
We'll see.

579
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:47,014
怎么样
What's up?

580
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:54,065
我想你会飘飘欲仙的  唷
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

581
00:41:09,073 --> 00:41:10,076
等等
Wait.

582
00:41:11,076 --> 00:41:13,033
不对不对
No, no.

583
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:15,000
不对  等等
No. Wait.

584
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,024
喂
Hey!

585
00:41:19,037 --> 00:41:20,044
喂
Hey!

586
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:23,057
喂
Hey.

587
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:26,055
搞什么  这里才一半
What the hell? This is only half.

588
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:28,085
对极了  给你的那一半
That's right. It's your half.

589
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,069
唷
Yo!

590
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,040
贱人  另一半呢
Where's the other half, bitch?

591
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:38,037
这真有点
I mean, it was, uh-- --

592
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,017
这一切都太不可思议了  伙计
The whole thing was crazy, man.

593
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:41,064
可怜的家伙  为他深感遗憾
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

594
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:45,014
他还以为我们是王牌特派员呢
He actually thought we were the cable guys, you know?

595
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:49,018
总之
Anyway, uh, um,

596
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:51,031
很抱歉对你的不敬  长官
sorry about those miscalls, Chief.

597
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:53,068
我已经换了线人  这事不会再发生了
I'm changing providers. It won't happen again.

598
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:57,068
你打算去埃尔帕索吗  汉克
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

599
00:41:57,072 --> 00:41:59,005
是啊
Hell, yes!

600
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,019
脚蹬尖头皮靴  帅气十足
With pointed boots and bells on.

601
00:42:01,022 --> 00:42:03,045
但我得先破了海森堡这个案子
Just I got this break in the Heisenberg case.

602
00:42:03,049 --> 00:42:04,076
你是说  那个蓝色冰毒案
The blue meth, you mean?

603
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,022
就凭小孩身上的那货
The teenth?

604
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:09,006
当然  就是这小孩带来了转机
Yeah, well, that teenth got things rolling.

605
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,093
我一直追踪到了锡沃拉的一家加油站
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.

606
00:42:10,096 --> 00:42:12,023
在那儿弄到这些线索
That's where I got these.

607
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:15,036
加油站的监视器被关了
Now, the station's, uh, closed circuit, uh, was down--

608
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,053
惊喜  惊喜
surprise, surprise--

609
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:19,010
但我从自动取款机的监视摄像中
but I was able to pull some of these snapshots

610
00:42:19,014 --> 00:42:21,050
拿到了这些快照
off an ATM security camera.

611
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:22,077
我一直都怀疑
Hey, now, I always thought

612
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,024
这些家伙是在野外制毒  对吗
these guys might be camper cooking, right?

613
00:42:24,027 --> 00:42:27,011
首先  这种含内饰的
First off, your typical Class C motor home

614
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:29,011
C类旅行房车
is going to grunt at least 5,000 pounds

615
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:30,034
至少得5000英镑
of interior fixtures, okay?

616
00:42:30,038 --> 00:42:31,088
内饰包括家电  家具  内置器具
We're talking appliances, furniture, built-ins.

617
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:33,071
起码5000英镑  对吧
5,000 pounds at least, okay?

618
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:36,055
看到这车的速度多快了吧
See how high that suspension's riding?

619
00:42:36,058 --> 00:42:40,025
要是负载那么多内饰是不可能达到这种速度
No way, no how, this thing's carrying that kind of weight.

620
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:42,055
显然是被去除了内饰
I mean, this thing has been cleared out

621
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,042
以提高密封度
and stripped down to its tight and curlies.

622
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:45,086
其用途是什么呢
For what?

623
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:47,079
用来做血库
Blood bank?

624
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:50,083
还是流动书库
Maybe a bookmobile?

625
00:42:50,086 --> 00:42:53,076
没有车牌的清晰截图
There's no clear view of the plates.

626
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,043
是啊  差点运气  是吧
Yeah, well, you can only get so lucky, right?

627
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:58,060
事实上这车子并没有前车牌
But the fact that there's no front plate

628
00:42:58,063 --> 00:43:00,040
更像是在新墨西哥州登记注册
tells me its likely New Mexico registration.

629
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,087
我去车管所确认过
I checked with DMV.

630
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,037
该州注册在案的这种80年代巴士
There are only 29 of these early '80s Bounders

631
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,071
只有29辆
registered in the state.

632
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:10,008
只有29辆
Only 29?

633
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:11,031
正是
Yeah.

634
00:43:11,034 --> 00:43:14,035
所以只需进行探访即可
So I got to go, uh, you know, knock on some doors.

635
00:43:22,055 --> 00:43:24,055
汉克  你得去埃尔帕索上任
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

636
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,029
没问题
You bet. I-- I--

637
00:43:26,032 --> 00:43:28,046
我得先破了海森堡一案
I'm just going to wrap up this Heisenberg thing first.

638
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:30,033
言下之意  你是拒绝上任喽
So you're refusing the assignment.

639
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:31,043
我没这意思  我会去的
No, I'm not. I'll go.

640
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:33,063
得再过段时间
It's just I need some more time.

641
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:36,010
你根本没听我讲话  施拉德探员
You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader.

642
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,023
时间所剩无几
You're out of time.

643
00:43:38,094 --> 00:43:43,080
你今晚是否去埃尔帕索上任
Are you going to El Paso now? Tonight?

644
00:43:47,051 --> 00:43:49,067
只要回答去或者不去
Just a simple yes or no.

645
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:57,078
不去
No.

646
00:43:59,072 --> 00:44:00,092
我去不了
I can't.

647
00:44:03,092 --> 00:44:07,002
但那是因为
But that's only because

648
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:09,012
我马上就能破获大案了
I'm really close to something big here.

649
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:22,000
那就给我立马破案
Better get to it, then.

650
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:50,075
正在播出的是KECA480  阿尔布开克广播新闻
This is KECA 480, Albuquerque news radio.

651
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,016
KECA新闻10点13
KECA news time 10:13.

652
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:54,056
今天的头条新闻是
Our top story this hour--

653
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,086
唐纳德·马格里斯  空中交通管制员
Donald Margolis, the air traffic controller

654
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:59,049
他因为造成了最近的空难  致使167人丧生
criticized for his role in the recent air disaster

655
00:44:59,053 --> 00:45:02,013
而备受指责
in which 167 persons died,

656
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:04,067
于今早被送往地方医院
was rushed to an area hospital early this morning,

657
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,097
显然
apparently the victim

658
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,050
他曾试图举枪自尽
of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

659
00:45:07,054 --> 00:45:09,010
对此警察未发表任何声明
Police won't say whether or not--

660
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:01,005
你的那份
Your half.

661
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:16,043
马上开  马上开
Okay, okay.
