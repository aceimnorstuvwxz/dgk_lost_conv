在那新墨西哥州  有个小城叫做杜克

3
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:30,066
在当地黑帮  有个鬼佬正声名鹊起

4
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:36,073
都是因为他所制的毒品

5
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:50,028
据说这货颜色纯蓝  品质纯正

6
00:00:56,035 --> 00:01:00,052
强力冰毒已在街头泛滥

7

只是没人能一睹真容  所以没人认识他

11
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:32,049
贩毒集团绝不会善罢甘休

12
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:40,046
这家伙死期将至  却还被蒙在鼓里

只是没人能一睹真容  所以没人认识他

28
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:11,085
贩毒集团的怒火  至今还无人能幸免

29
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:19,057
这家伙死期将至  却还被蒙在鼓里

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,020
绝

氮和氧通过化学键结合
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,

37
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:49,011
就会转化为
Which, in turn...

38
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:53,048
你知道什么是化学键吧
You do know what a bond is?

39
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:59,067
一种强烈的吸引力
A strong force of attraction.

40
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,084
比如共价键  离子键
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

41
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:07,078
原子和分子相互结合组成化合物
The coming together of atoms and molecules to form compounds?

42
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,002
正是化学键
Chemical bonds

43
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,058
让物质成为了物质
Are what make matter matter.

44
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:20,050
正是化学键  把物质世界联系起来

45
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:21,075
把我们联系起来

00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:28,077
你的考试成绩可不这么说
Your test score says otherwise.

50
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:31,007
正说明你啥都没搞懂
It tells me you don't get it at all.

51
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:35,034
58分  差不多了
I mean, 58. I was close.

52
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:42,050
什么叫差不多了
What is close?

53
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:45,043
科学领域可没有"差不多"一说  巴里
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

54
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:47,091
只有正确错误之分
There are right answers and wrong answers.

55
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,064
"差不多"可不能让人类登上月球
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

56
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,090
是, 但是
Yeah, but...

57
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:54,044
我只是想说  才两分而已  怀特先生
I'm just saying, Mr. White, 2 points?

58
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:59,026
如果我化学不过  就得参加暑假补习班
If I don't pass chemistry,I have to go to summer school.

59
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:03,071
我是说  我真的用功了

60
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:06,003
真的  真的用功了

62
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:11,024
我对化学很感兴趣的

63
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:14,007
比如这些概念什么的  我只是觉得
The concepts.I just think I might have

64
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,095
我可能得了注意力缺陷症
The attention deficit.

65
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:21,021
你就不能放我一马吗
Couldn't you please just let this slide?

66
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:33,020
别痴人说梦了
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

67
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,062
不行  下次自己发愤图强吧
The answer is no.Next time, apply yourself.

68
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:26,045
认识我的  就留个口信吧
Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

69
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,056
你是在躲着我还是怎么着
Are you ducking me or what?

70
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,041
我都打了三个电话给你了
This makes the third time.

71
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,013
听着  我这手机

上次我们说的那事
That thing we talked about?

75
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:43,050
我跟你说"处理掉"
When I said "handle it"?

76
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,099
不用麻烦了
Well, don't.

77
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:48,005
就这么吧
Let it go.

119
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:29,090
知道我一直打给你是什么事吧
You know, that blinking thing I've been calling you on?

120
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:31,084
随便吧  老兄
Whatever, man.

121
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:37,085
-还给我  -再抢我就摔了它  我就摔了它
- Give me my...- I will break this! I will break this!

122
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:40,098
TM就会吸毒的笨蛋
Damn druggy idiot.

123
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,087
我找了你那么久
Is this what you've been doing the whole time

124
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,059
你就一直这么窝着吸这个吗
 I've been trying to reach you?

125
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,051
当然不是
No.

126
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,040
我出去处理事情了
I've been taking care of business.

127
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,093
-什么事情  -你问我什么事情
- What business? - What business?

128
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:53,050
你逼着我做的事情  混蛋
The business you put me on, asshole.

129
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:55,031
你忘了吗
You already forgot?

130
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,097
就是这个事情
This business.

131
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,077
这个有没有让你想起点什么
Does that jog your memory?

132
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,051
你个王八蛋
Son of a bitch.

133
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,064
-你不会真的  -你说了  "处理掉"
- You didn't actually... - You said "handle it."

134
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,009
所以我把他解决了
So I handled it.

135
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,044
我说"处理掉"的意思  是让你恐吓威胁他
When I said "handle it,"I meant fear and intimidation.

136
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,073
是让你把钱拿回来
Get your money back.

137
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:26,083
-我从来没有让你  -没有让我去杀人的意思吗

没有
No

139
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:31,017
太晚了  因为那家伙已经挂了
Too late, yo, because dude's dead.

140
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,001
我的天
Oh, God.

141
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:34,006
-懂了吗  死翘翘了  -天
- All right? Way dead. - Oh, God.

142
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:38,070

143
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:43,097
4660块
4,660 bucks.

144
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,056
你的那一半
Your half.

我的老天  那个声音

那声音怎么都忘不了

162
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:14,091
会有人以为你杀人了吗
Does anybody think that you killed anybody?

163

然后他们就过来抓了她

天  她简直就是疯掉了

无缘无故就这么杀了他
She did it for, like, nothing.

他是骂她贱货了  但她本来就是贱货啊
He told her she was a skank, but,I mean, she was a skank.

她能指认你当时就在那吗

老兄  她连自己是谁都不知道了

我还是搞不清楚这些细节
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy on the mechanics, here.

177
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:01,009
难道
But

178

你就不能阻止那女人杀掉他吗

179

她拿枪指着我  好吗
Look, she had a gun on me, all right?

00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,095
是女孩  我们都很高兴
It's a little girl.We're very excited.

284
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,091
我想也是  儿女双全了
I'll bet.One of each.

285
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:02,003
小沃尔特怎么样
How's Walt Jr.?

286
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:06,018
高一了  像野草一样开始疯长
Tenth grade and he's just growing like a weed.

287
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,044
现在已经比我都高了
He's taller than I am now.

288
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:13,046
我猜他以后至少有6英尺3  6英尺4[1.9-1.93米]
I'm betting 6'3", 6'4" by the time he's finished.

289
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,030
长得挺英俊  感谢上帝
Wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

290
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:18,047
遗传好啊
Good genes.

291
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:25,083
说起电影明星  那不会是你家的双胞胎吧
Speaking of movie stars,those can't be the twins.

292
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,077
对  就是她们
Yep, that's them.

293
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:31,007
-她们真漂亮  -是很漂亮
- They're gorgeous. - Yes, they are.

294
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:33,012
她们自己也这么认为
And they know it.

295
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:36,070
-看来我以后有得操心了  是吧  -就是
- I'm in real trouble there, huh? - Yeah.

296
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,087
-这么说  接你父亲班了  -是啊
- So, the big office? - Yeah.

297
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:45,063
很奇怪  是不
Weird, isn't it?

298
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,050
我还是觉得是我爸在这办公
I still think of it as my dad's.

299
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:50,010
我很想他
I miss him.

300
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,046
我也是
Me, too.

301
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:55,024
我很想让他为我感到骄傲
I'd like to think he'd be proud.

302
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,009
去年是我们业绩最好的一年
Last year was our best year yet.

303
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,090
他会为你骄傲的
He'd be proud.

304
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,022
沃尔特  他怎么样
Walt, how's he doing?

305
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,012
他一切都好
He is doing great.

306
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:09,029
他一直很努力
He's plugging away.

307
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:10,035
太好了
Great.

308
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:13,000
-他还在教书吗  -是的
- He still teaching? - Yeah.

309
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:16,099
-帮我转达下问候  -我一定转达
- You tell him I said hello. - I will definitely do that.

310
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:23,040
老实说  泰德
To be honest, Ted,

311
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,024
我这次来  不只是来问个好的
I didn't just stop by to say hello.

312
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:31,044
我是来申请份数据录入工作的
I was applying for the data entry job.

313
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:34,040
你开什么玩笑
You're kidding.

314
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:37,076
你可一直是我们最棒的记账员
You were like our go-to book keeper.

315
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,070
经济形势  你也知道的  所以...
The economy, you know, so...

316
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:46,022
数据录入  那怎么可以
Well, data entry,that'd be a mistake.

317
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:54,094
做回你的老本行  怎么样
How about...get your old job back?

318
00:22:57,028 --> 00:22:58,088
公司发展得很快
We're expanding and...

319
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:03,053
咱私下说说啊  整个部门简直就一团乱
Between you and me, that whole department is pretty much of a mess.

320
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,080
这工作你完全可以胜任
Your work would be cut out for you. But...

321
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:09,022
而且我们需要你帮忙
We could use your help.

322
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,022
好的
Ok

323
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:22,098
现在这些是我们地盘  对吗  目前来说 
Now, this is our territory, right? Currently.

324
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:24,072
你在听吗
Hello?

325
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:27,013
-对的  -然后  看看这里
- Correct. - All right, then. Now, look at this.

326
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:29,036
这里这里这里  还有这里
Here, here, here and here.

327
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,018
这些对你来说意味着什么
What does that look like to you?

328
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:37,054
机会  赚大钱的机会  就是这个
Opportunities. Golden ones.That's what that looks like.

329
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:41,025
看看这里  整个城市商机无限啊
Look.It's an entire city full of buyers.

330
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:43,001
那么  为什么我们还没扩展到那里
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

331
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:46,081
-因为那不是我们的地盘  -因为我们缺乏进取心
- Because it's not our territory.- Because we lack initiative.

332
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:50,044
-进取心  -你得雇用更多的毒贩
- Initiative? - You need to employ more dealers.

333
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:52,007
增加两倍  三倍的人手
Double, triple your crew.

334
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:54,091
我见到的那三个人  每人都应该找三个  六个
Those three I met...they should each have three, six,

335
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:57,031
九个下家  为他们工作
Nine sub-dealers working for them.

336
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:59,064
指数级的增长  那才是关键
Exponential growth...that's the key.

337
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,064
那不是我们的地盘
It's not our territory.

338
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:04,060
你听得懂吗  老兄
Man, you follow me, here?

339
00:24:05,051 --> 00:24:08,003
我们要是介入到别人的地盘
We go rolling into these neighborhoods,

340
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:10,018
那些家伙不会放过我们的
Other crews ain't going to take kindly.

341
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:13,086
-你明白吗  -当然  他们会不高兴
- You understand? - Sure. They won't like it.

342
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:16,079
但我敢说他们不会把我们怎么样的
But I say they're not going to do a thing about it.

343
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:18,083
听着  杰西  不
Listen, Jesse.-No.

344
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:20,062
杰西
 Jesse.

345
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,072
局势已经变了  消息已经传开了  
The game has changed.The word is out.

346
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:27,062
说你是个惹不得的人
And you are a killer.

347
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,054
-你在说什么呢  -显然这点已经人尽皆知了
- What are you talking about?- Apparently it's all over town.

348
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:35,002
有人惹了你  你大发雷霆
Somebody crossed you. You got angry.

349
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:38,009
用台自动取款机砸碎了他的脑袋
You crushed their skull with an ATM machine.

350
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:40,081
-但这根本不是事实  -谁在乎呢
- But that's not how it happened. - Who cares?

351
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:44,051
只要我们的竞争对手  而不是警察  相信这点
Just as long as it's our competitors who believe it and not the police.

352
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:47,038
-我的天  -你没看出来这事有多棒吗
- My God.- Don't you see how great this is?

353
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:51,002
你看  你就是一个...
Look, you are a...

354
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,066
杰西  看着我
Jesse, look at me.

355
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,079
你  就是条河豚
You... are a blowfish.

356
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,029
-什么  -河豚  想想看
- What? - A blowfish. Think about it.

357
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:06,083
体型不大  动作不快  也不灵活
Small in stature,not swift, not cunning.

358
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:10,065
很容易成为盘中餐  但是河豚
Easy prey for predators.But the blowfish

359
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,049
有一项秘密武器  对吗
Has a secret weapon, doesn't he?

360
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:16,042
河豚会怎么做  杰西
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?

361
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:18,017
河豚会怎么做
What does the blowfish do?

362
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,006
-我不知道  -河豚会膨胀
- I don't know... - The blowfish puffs up.

363
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:27,060
河豚能自我膨胀到平常的四到五倍大
The blowfish puffs himself up four or five times larger than normal.

364
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:29,036
为什么  它为什么会这么做呢
And why? Why does he do that?

365
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:32,074
这样能让它具有威慑力  这就是原因
So that it makes him intimidating,that's why.

366
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:33,097
威慑力
Intimidating,

367
00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:37,035
这样才能把其他更可怕的鱼都吓跑
So that the other scarier fish are scared off.

368
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:39,088
而这就你是  你就是那条河豚
And that's you.You are a blowfish.

369
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:43,003
知道了吗  所有这些都是种错觉
You see? It's just all an illusion.

370
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:45,084
明白了吗  这就是个烟雾弹
See? It's nothing but air.

371
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:49,007
现在
Now,

372
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:52,063
谁还敢跟河豚对着干呀  杰西
Who messes with the blowfish, Jesse?

373
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,004
-没人敢  -你说得真TM对
- Nobody.- You're damn right.

374
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,088
-我是河豚  -你是河豚
- I'm a blowfish.- You are a blowfish.

375
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:03,001
-再说一遍  -我是河豚
- Say it again.- I'm a blowfish.

376
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:05,088
-郑重其事地说一遍  -我就是河豚
- Say it like you mean it.- I'm a blowfish!

377
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,001
就是这样
That's it.

378
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:10,008
河豚要来一下这个
Blowfishing this up.

379
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:52,087
商品型录  把那本型录给我  好吗
The SkyMall.Give me the SkyMall, would you?

380
00:26:58,093 --> 00:27:01,080
万科  这新来的不会讲西班牙话吗
Vanco, new guy don't speak Spanish?

381
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:03,043
怎么了
What's up?

382
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:06,043
白佬
Hey, white boy,

383
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,082
最好学着点西班牙语  懂吗
Better learn espanol, huh?

384
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:12,032
这里可不是美国的密苏里州布兰森  懂我意思吗
This ain't Branson, Missouri.You know what I'm talking about?

385
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,027
我看这样吧
You know what?

386
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:15,084
我来教你
I'll teach you.

387
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:20,066
意思就是
It means

388
00:27:21,037 --> 00:27:22,087
"我们来做个交易吧"
"Let's make a deal."

389
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:25,037

看看这个
Look at that.

400
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:56,037
铺在地上的一块小地毯
It's a rug you put on the floor,

401
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:59,056
只不过看起来跟百元美钞一样
Except for it looks like a hundred dollar bill.

402
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:01,075
我爱死它了  给我来20个
I love them.Get me 20 of them.

403
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:03,097
我要把家里铺满这个
I'm going to put them all over my casa.

404
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:05,029
我们会给你买三个
We'll get you three.

405
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:07,054
-给我买10个吧  -最多5个
- You give me ten.- Five.

406
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:13,067
别拿我们开涮了  好吧
How about you stop jerking us off, here?

407
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:19,076

White boy don't like "Let's make a deal."

409
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:27,005
你再这么浪费他的时间  白佬要给你好看了
White boy's going to kick your ass,you don't stop wasting his time.

410
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:28,030
施拉德
Schrader...

411
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:29,053
白佬

412
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:31,065
我的名字叫玳瑁
My name's Tortuga.

413
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:34,021
你知道什么意思嘛
You know what that means?

414
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:38,079
要我猜的话  西班牙语里应该是"傻帽"的意思
Well, if I had to guess,I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole".

415
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,005
"玳瑁"意思就是"乌龟"
"Tortuga" means "turtle."

416
00:28:42,075 --> 00:28:43,075
我就是这样的
That's me.

417
00:28:47,044 --> 00:28:48,069
做事不慌不忙
I take my time,

418
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,097
但最后的赢家总是我
But I always win.

419
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:59,012
这倒提醒我了  快看这个  我以前见过的
That reminds me.Wait, I seen this earlier, look it.

420
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:01,094
这个太棒了  伙计

426
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:16,064

Hank's doing great down there.He's really making inroads.

427
00:29:16,077 --> 00:29:19,027
当然了  他可是个英雄
I'm sure he is.He's a hero, after all.

428
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,027
-那你会去挨尔帕索吗[德州西南部]  -拜托
- So, you going to go down to El Paso?  - Please.

429
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,034
我们这儿就够落后的了
It's third-world enough around here.

430
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:27,007
再说他也忙得根本没时间
They keep him busy every second.

431
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:29,094
他们马上就有个大行动  
He's already got some big operation going, some kind

432
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:32,074
好像是啥秘密行动吧  他什么都不说
Of hush-hush deal. He couldn't tell me a thing about it except

433
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:36,009
-就说是个境外行动  -听起来热血沸腾啊
- It's on the other side of the border.- That sounds exciting.

434
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,056
他在那很安全的  对吗
He's being safe, right?

435
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:42,000
他老说一直就做些办公室工作
He says he's mostly riding a desk

436
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,099
咱私下说说啊  我还巴不得这样呢
Which between you and me, is how I want it.

437
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:47,020
说到办公室工作
Speaking of riding desks...

438
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,010
今天我找了份工作
I got myself a job today.

439
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:52,094
你不是吧
You did not.

440
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:57,084
挺着这么个大肚子
As big as you are?

441
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,088
多谢关心
Thank you.

442
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:03,048
我只是想说
You know I just mean...

443
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,008
在哪儿  跟谁呀
Where? With who?

444
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:09,017
合着还有人愿意跟个大肚子共事啊
Well, someone willing to work around that, apparently.

445
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:13,008
-是贝内克的公司  -你不是吧
- Beneke. - You did not.

446
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:15,045
对你毛手毛脚的那位还在那吗
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

447
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:17,036
玛丽  只有圣诞晚会上那一次嘛
Marie.It was one time at a Christmas party,

448
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:22,004
而且他当时已经醉到话都讲不清了
And he was so drunk he was practically slurring his words.

449
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:24,019
是你自己在给他找借口吧
Just what you want in an executive.

450
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,091
而且他也反复道过歉了
And he apologized profusely.

451
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:27,084
再说他是有家室的人了
Plus, he's married, has a family.

452
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,064
肯定也不愿被冠个性骚扰的罪名吧
He doesn't want to get sued for sexual harassment.

453
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:32,091
这种事  绝不会再发生了
It will not...happen again.

454
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:36,041
你们手头真那么紧吗
Is money that tight?

455
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,090
是的
Yeah.

456

不用了玛丽  你知道沃尔特这个人的  他
No,Marie.You know Walt.He would just...

458
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,035
说曹操曹操到
Speak of the devil.

459
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:58,008
你们怎么样  在聊什么
How are you? What's up?

460

-没聊什么  你怎么样  -很好

-没啥事吧  -一切都好
- Everything okay?- Everything's perfect.

463
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:34,009
这个是葡萄干小麦片
This is Raisin Bran,

464
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:37,050
-不是葡萄干麦脆  -那又如何  一样的嘛
- Not Raisin Bran Crunch. - So? Same thing.

465
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:39,068
不一样的
Not the same thing.

466
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:42,088
那这样吧  下次你去超市买东西
I'll tell you what.Why don't you do the grocery shopping?

467
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:46,017
这样你就可以想买啥就买啥了  这想法好
And then you can get whatever you want. Great!

468
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:50,031
妈  这没那么复杂的
It's not that hard, Mom.

469
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:54,019
-盒子上有写"脆"字的就好  -别纠结了
- It says "crunch" on the box.- You're pushing it.

470
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:55,031
早上好

471
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:58,043
嗨 老爸  - 嗨
Hi,dad.-Hi.

472
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:01,049
老爸  注意到什么了吗
Dad, notice anything?

473
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:06,049
今天要去参加葬礼吗
Is there a funeral today?

474
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:09,000
葬礼  天哪  我看起来有那么糟吗
A funeral? Christ, do I look that bad?

475
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:10,007
不是  不是...
No,no no..

476
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:11,080
妈妈找了份工作
Mom got a job.

477
00:32:12,044 --> 00:32:13,065
工作  为什么
A job? Why?

478
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:16,067
要我拿支票本给你看看吗-不用
Do I need to get out the checkbook and show you?-No.

479
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:20,008
以你现在的情况  这么做好吗-没事 没事
Is this a good idea in your condition?-No no.

480
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:22,070
医生说我可以一直工作到临产
The doctor said I can work practically up until I go into labor.

481
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:25,038
而且就是文职  我只要一直坐着就行了  
And it's just an office job. I'm just sitting on my butt.

482
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:28,095
在哪上班
Where?

483
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:31,027

484

那焊接烟尘之类的怎么办
What about the welding fumes?

487
00:32:37,073 --> 00:32:39,040
你当初不就是为这离职的吗
Isn't that why you had to quit in the first place?

488
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:41,013
他们之后就开始注重环保了
They've gone green since then.

489
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:45,035
现在都用类似绿色焊接技术啥的了

490
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:47,070
我过去的时候  没闻到什么味

500
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:36,090
你总算出洞了
You left your cave.

501
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:42,000
我有点想我的电视了 
I was kind of missing my TV.

502
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:46,057
正想着去好市多[大型超市]  买个贼大的宽屏回来
I was thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.Snag a big-ass wide screen.

503
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,057
那么
So...

504
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,018
你在画什么
What you drawing?

505
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:57,024

-就是做这个用的  -真的吗
- That's the plan.- Really?

509
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,068
我在阿尔布开克的一家纹身店里兼职
I work part-time down at ABQ Ink.

510
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,068
靠谱
Right on.

511
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,064
你真是个好画家
You're a real good drawer.

512
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,050
我以前也画过一点
I used to do a little of that.

513
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:18,070
你以前也画过画
You used to be a drawer, too?

514
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:23,089
那怎么不画了
What stopped you?

515
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:29,034

来  跟我说说
So, tell me something.

你这算个什么纹身艺术家啊

自己都没纹身的

00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:39,089
这话题转得够快的啊
That's way too big a commitment.

520
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,012
嘿！哥们.你是平克曼
Hey.man.You're Pinkman.

521
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,070

You're the man! Everybody's been talking about you.

522
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,004
老兄  真有你的  继续保持

我以为你叫杰克逊
I thought your name was Jackson.

525
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,016
你那线人叫"乌龟"还真没叫错
Your snitch has really earned his nickname.

526
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:36,059
我们这是要等到明天吗

他们会来的
They'll show.

528
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,044
为什么这么说
Why's that?

529
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:43,085
又给了更多的商品目录让他挑吗
You got more catalogs for him to clean out?

530
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,035
是醒目形象[邮购商]还是陶仓[家居品牌]
You know, Sharper Image or Pottery Barn?

531
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,035
他们到底怎么想的

532
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:56,068
派这么个言语不通的大嘴巴过来

533
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,079
政治手段  老兄  政治

534
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:05,001
还说是什么了不起的大英雄  我看是扯淡

535
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:07,045
也许在阿尔布开克是英雄

536
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,027
到这儿就行不通了

537
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:15,063
有什么我该知道的吗
Something I need to know about?

538
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:17,056
什么  刚刚吗  不是啦老兄
What? That? No,man.

539
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:20,051
我们只是在称颂你呢

Is that your guy?

543
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:49,099
我想那就是你们的人
I think that's your guy.

544
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:53,038
他该死的上那干嘛去了
What the hell is he doing down there?

545
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,056
你去哪啊
Where you going?

546
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:07,037

548
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:14,015
以前从没见过龟背上驮着的人头吗
You act like you never saw a severed human head on a tortoise before.

549
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:27,081
欢迎来到
Welcome to...

550
00:38:53,012 --> 00:38:54,063
老天爷啊  我的腿
God damn, my leg.

551
00:39:19,004 --> 00:39:20,070
游戏规则变了
The game has changed.

552
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,048
这里是我们的天下了
This is our city.

我们要在这当家做主

I'm going to be king and you guys will be princes or dukes or something.

560
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:45,055

Layered,

566
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:01,093
像玉米脆饼一样  这叫指数生长

这才叫成功

我们开价不够高

577
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:42,015
什么
What?

578
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:45,053
垄断市场  再抬高价格
Corner the market,then raise the price.

579

- Looks like they got you all set up.- Yeah. It's perfect.

582
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,008
离洗手间够近  我就不用挺着大肚走太远
I am close enough to the bathroom not to waddle too far,
