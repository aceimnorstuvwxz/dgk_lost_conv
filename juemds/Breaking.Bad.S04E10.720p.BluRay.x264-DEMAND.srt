1
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,910
你能行得
You can do this.

2
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,710
第四季 第十集
S04E10: Salud

3
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,280
这里是沃尔特・怀特家
You have reached Walter White.

4
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
请在提示音后留下的名字
At the tone please state your name, number,

5
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,510
电话及留言
and the reason for your call.

6
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,350
谢谢
Thank you.

7
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,040
第三通了
Third try.

8
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
沃尔特  如果你在家  请接电话
Walt, if you're there, please pick up.

9
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,640
我真的想和你一起做这事
Okay. Well, I really wanted to do this together,

10
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,709
但是我已经听见他起床的声音了
but I can hear him getting up,

11
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,609
我也没法让他不看到那东西
and it's not like I can keep him from seeing the thing,

12
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,709
所以对不起  我已经等你很久了
so I'm sorry, but I've waited as long as possible,

13
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,080
现在只好一个人来了
and I-- I guess I'm going to have to go ahead without you,

14
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,840
给我回电话
so call me.

15
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,640
十六岁生日快乐
Oh. Hey, happy birthday, sweet sixteen.

16
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,410
谢了  妈
Thanks, Mom.

17
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,510
我还以为你要睡过去呢
Of course, I thought you might sleep through it.

18
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,040
既然都快到中午了
So since it's almost-- oh, noon,

19
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,709
那你生日的第一个重大决定就是
I think your first big birthday decision

20
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,009
吃早饭还是午饭
is breakfast or lunch.

21
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,959
吃薄饼吧
Um, pancakes?

22
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,440
没问题
Pancakes it is.

23
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,509
能帮我个忙吗
Okay, could you do me a favor?

24
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,680
我忘了拿报纸了
I forgot to get the paper.

25
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,840
能去帮我拿进来吗
Can you go out and grab it for me?

26
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,040
-当然  -谢谢
- Sure. - Thanks.

27
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,740
惊喜
Surprise!

28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,340
这是我和你爸一起送给你的
It's from me and your dad.

29
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,980
很不错吧
It's pretty slick, huh?

30
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,310
是啊  谢了  妈
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

31
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,910
很  很不错
It's-- It's great.

32
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,440
我可是费劲了心思
You know, I really did a lot of research,

33
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,880
也不知道为什么
and, I don't know,

34
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,580
就是看上了这一辆
this car just really stood out to me.

35
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,080
它的优点可多了
It's got a ton of great features--

36
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,240
马力强劲
power everything, solid engine,

37
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,360
里面很宽敞
It's really roomy,

38
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,340
你能载很多朋友
so you can carpool with all your friends,

39
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,980
而且既然你妈妈我挑的
and of course it is safe

40
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,420
这车一定安全
because I am still your mother.

41
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,910
这车还有CD播放机呢
Oh, and it has a CD player,

42
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,390
你开的时候还能听音乐
so you can listen to some tunes while you're cruising around,

43
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,440
所以
so you know what?

44
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,880
早饭可以晚点吃
Breakfast can wait.

45
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,140
你想先开出去兜兜风吗
You want to take it for a spin?

46
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,580
等一下吧
Um, m-m-maybe later.

47
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,610
我饿了
I'm kind of starving.

48
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
好吧  那
Yeah, okay. Well, let's--

49
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,680
我去做薄饼
let's get those pancakes going.

50
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,637
索尔  他来了
Saul? He's here.

51
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,409
坏主意
Bad idea.

52
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,780
这是个坏主意
This is a bad idea.

53
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,140
索尔
Saul.

54
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,710
让他进来
Send him in.

55
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,557
贝内克先生  我是索尔・古德曼
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.

56
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,400
多谢你过来
Thank you for coming down.

57
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,180
你好
Yeah. Hi.

58
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,540
请坐
Have a seat, please.

59
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,110
我
I--

60
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,060
我不知道为什么要过来
I don't really understand why I'm here.

61
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,660
和我的债主有关系吗
Is it something to do with my creditors?

62
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,210
债主  不是
Creditors? No.

63
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,360
我就直说了
I'll cut right to the chase.

64
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,760
贝内克先生  我有一个坏消息
Mr. Beneke, I have some bad news.

65
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,890
最近都是坏消息
Nothing but, lately.

66
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,290
你的姨姥姥波吉特去世了
Your great-aunt Birgit passed away.

67
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,460
抱歉  谁
I'm sorry, who?

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,730
她八年前
Apparently, she passed away in Diekirch, Luxembourg,

69
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,160
在卢森堡迪基希区去世
and this was, wow, eight years ago.

70
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,730
我还以为你和她很亲呢
I just assumed you two were close,

71
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,160
这么看来的话
given that--

72
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,210
也许这是个好消息
Well, maybe this is good news.

73
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,969
波吉特留下一笔客观的遗产
Birgit left behind a sizable estate,

74
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,438
而你是主要受益人
of which you, Mr. Beneke, are the primary beneficiary.

75
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,060
-什么   -没错  她好像没有直系亲属
-What?   -Yeah, well, seems she had no immediate relatives,

76
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,909
所以在欧洲保管她遗产的人
so the estate's just been sitting

77
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,000
一直在寻找她的继承人
while the folks over in the EU searched for a living heir.

78
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,460
我不知道有亲戚住在卢森堡
I don't know of any relatives in Luxembourg,

79
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,490
更不会有人在遗嘱中提到我了
definitely no one who would name me in their will.

80
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,990
好吧
Well...

81
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,290
你看
Ah, here you go.

82
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,860
她没有留下遗嘱
She left no will,

83
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,320
所以才花了这么长时间
so that's probably why it took so long.

84
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,390
他们查到你父亲
They traced the inheritance through to your father,

85
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,590
但他已经去世了
but his having passed--

86
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,760
节哀顺变
my condolences--

87
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,000
那么现在你就是继承人
you are the next in line to the tune of

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,820
总共是621552.33美元
$621,552.33.

89
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,490
伊兰迪奥先生什么时候到

90
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,700
让我们先看看他是怎么制毒的

91
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,870
谁是制毒师

92
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,250
这是个玩笑么

93
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,080
他问你是不是制毒师
He's asking if you are the chemist.

94
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,090
我是其中之一
I'm one of them.

95
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,100
好了  互相都认识了

96
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,610
开始工作吧

97
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,620
苯乙酸在哪
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

98
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,540
请带他去拿苯乙酸

99
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,920
我们都是自己合成的

100
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,210
所有的原料都在这里

101
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,790
他们都是自己合成的
They synthesize their own.

102
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
什么
What?

103
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,710
我不  我不会做
I don't-- I don't do that.

104
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,760
有什么问题吗

105
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,090
听着  我都是从
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid

106
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,620
那个上面画着蜜蜂的桶里拿
from the barrel with the bee on it.

107
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,720
这就是我的方法
That's how I know how to do it.

108
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,860
平克曼先生以为在他来的途中

109
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,510
你们已经把苯乙酸准备好了

110
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,910
任何大二的化学生都能自己做

111
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,250
你居然带这种外行人给我们

112
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,409
他说什么
What is he saying?

113
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,610
我们正在解决
We're working it out.

114
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,790
这太可笑了

115
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,740
我可不会让

116
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,210
连苯基乙酸都不会合成的小屁孩

117
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,610
来教我

118
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,160
告诉这个傻逼  要是他想学怎么做我的货
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn how to make my product,

119
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,360
就得必须听我的  我说的就是真理
he's got to do it my way, the right way.

120
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,960
我会说英语
I speak English.

121
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,320
那你就应该明白什么叫傻逼
So you understand what asshole means.

122
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,260
现在  快给我送来我的苯基乙酸  傻逼
Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid, asshole.

123
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,590
他需要的东西你们需要多久制作
How long is it going to take you to get him what he needs?

124
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,920
我不清楚
I don't know. I have no idea.

125
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,390
-至少几小时吧  -我有的是时间
- Several hours at least. - I can wait.

126
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,660
正好给我点时间来说说这间实验室
Gives us time to talk about the state of this lab.

127
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,490
难道你们没有卫生标准
Don't you have standards?

128
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,490
我是说  这地方肮脏极了
I mean, this place is disgusting.

129
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,509
既然这样  给我把每个缸  每个水槽
All right, we're going to scour every vat, every tank,

130
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,290
每个制毒工作台都给我刷干净
every cook surface,

131
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,254
然后我们再来把每一个
and then we're going to clean up

132
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:22,420
潜在的污染源给清理掉
every possible source of contamination,

133
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,010
在那之后  我们再开始制毒
and only then we cook.

134
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,160
懂了吗
Comprende?

135
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,160
你以为自己是谁
Who do you think you are?

136
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,190
我是你老板带来
I'm the guy your boss brought here

137
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,300
来教你怎么做的
to show you how it's done,

138
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,560
要是你就这样管理你的实验室  怪不得
and if this is how you run your lab, no wonder.

139
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,420
你该庆幸他没把你开除
You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.

140
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,670
现在  要是你不想这样的话
Now, if you don't want that to happen,

141
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,110
我建议你别再像娘们一样哀诉
I suggest you stop whining like a little bitch

142
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,850
并且按照我说的做
and do what I said.

143
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,320
开始清理

144
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,230
这里是沃尔特・怀特家
You have reached Walter White.

145
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,130
请听到嘟声后留下你的姓名  号码
At the tone please state your name, number,

146
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,400
和您打来的缘由
and the reason for your call.

147
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,030
谢谢配合
Thank you.

148
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,090
爸爸  你在不
Dad! You there?

149
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,050
我在门外
I'm outside.

150
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,160
你还好吗
Are you okay?

151
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,270
我知道你在家  你的车都在
I know you're home. Your car is here.

152
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,000
你都没来我的派对
You missed my party,

153
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,850
我就想你一定发生了什么事
which feels like something's gotta be really wrong.

154
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,270
再联系不到你我就要报警了
I'm... I'm gonna have to call 911.

155
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,490
我不知道我现在还能做什么
I don't know what else to do.

156
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,910
老爸
Dad?

157
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,120
要进来就快进吧
Come in if you're coming in.

158
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,050
你怎么了
What happened to you?

159
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,340
发生了什么
What happened?

160
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,210
我卷入了一场斗争
I got into a fight.

161
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,409
你说什么  斗争
What do you mean, a fight?

162
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,240
什么样的斗争
Like, what fight?

163
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,380
你准备现在和我说吗
Are you going to talk to me here?

164
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,709
你在干什么
What are you doing?

165
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,080
我在打电话给妈妈
I'm calling Mom.

166
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,110
别打
Don't do that.

167
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,510
听着  我
Look, I--

168
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,409
我十分感谢你的关心
I appreciate that you're concerned.

169
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,810
可我没事
I'm fine.

170
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,180
别打给你妈
Just do not call your mother.

171
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,110
为什么
Why not?

172
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,640
因为
Because...

173
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,940
我又开始赌博了
I was gambling.

174
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,940
要是你告诉你妈
If you tell your mother,

175
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,410
天哪  我就会
God, I just would--

176
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
我会被她无休止的烦死的
I would never, never hear the end of it,

177
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,210
所以  求你了
so please...

178
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,340
这能成为我们之间的小秘密吗
Can we just keep this between us?

179
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,880
能为我保守这个秘密吗
Would you do that for me?

180
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,340
把它埋在心底
Just keep it to yourself.

181
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,640
我就是不明白
I don't understand.

182
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,540
你怎么会卷入一场斗争
How'd you get into a fight?

183
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,510
而且是和谁啊
And with who?

184
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,140
我犯了一个错误
I made a mistake.

185
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,780
都是我自己造成的
And it's my own fault.

186
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,940
都怪我
I had it coming.

187
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,180
爸爸  没关系
Dad, it's okay.

188
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,840
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

189
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,240
我太对不起你了
I just-- I'm sorry.

190
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,410
对不起
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,540
爸爸
Dad...

192
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,010
来
Come here.

193
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,280
别这样  爸爸  没关系
Come on. Dad, it's okay.

194
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,610
没关系
It's okay.

195
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,850
求你了  没关系
Please, it's-- it's okay.

196
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,490
看着我  看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

197
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,210
没关系
It's okay.

198
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,380
别哭了
It is. Come on.

199
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,110
别哭了
Come on.

200
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,440
没关系
It's okay.

201
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,710
你生日过得怎样
Hey, how was your birthday?

202
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,080
还不错  你好好休息
Good. Get some rest.

203
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,280
好的
Okay.

204
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,680
那辆新车
The new car?

205
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,980
是你开过来的吗
Did you drive it here?

206
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,980
是的
Yeah.

207
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,410
真不错
That's good.

208
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,340
你喜欢吗
You like it?

209
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,740
当然啦
Uh, sure.

210
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,440
我当然喜欢
I do.

211
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,920
开起来感觉不错
It drives great.

212
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,180
太好了  杰西
That's good, Jesse.

213
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,120
太棒了
Yes.

214
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,830
干的好
Well done.

215
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,210
第一批货
First of many.

216
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,710
你说什么
Yeah?

217
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,840
什么意思
What's that mean?

218
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,940
你能留下了
You're staying.

219
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,010
现在你归卡特尔集团了
You belong to the cartel now.

220
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,710
你不能这么随便就来我这里
You can't come to my work like this.

221
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,342
人人都认识你
You're too recognizable.

222
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,609
你这张脸印在
Your face is plastered

223
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,310
方圆五英里每个站牌广告上
on every bus bench within a 5-mile radius.

224
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,510
公众人物也得洗车啊
Celebrities have to get their cars washed,

225
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:49,510
和别人一样
just like everybody else.

226
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,199
要是没急事我也不会来的
Look, I wouldn't have come if it wasn't important.

227
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,910
-行吧  -什么事
- Okay? - What is it?

228
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,780
我直接见了你那位贝内克先生
Well, I went ahead and met with your Mr. Beneke,

229
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,080
本人正式再次强调  愚蠢
which I will say again, loudly and for the record, bad idea.

230
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,950
嗯  但总比坐牢强  对吗
Yes, but it is better than prison. Correct?

231
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,220
算是吧
Marginally,

232
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,910
所以我才按你说的把钱给了他
which is why I disbursed the funds as you requested.

233
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,250
很好啊
All right, good.

234
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,810
不过我不信他真的吃这套
Yeah, I can't believe he actually bought it--

235
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,380
突然就蹦出个"波吉特阿姨"
"Great-aunt Birgit."

236
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,010
简直胡扯  可你一意孤行
What? But you called it.

237
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,510
人们对眼皮底下招摇撞骗的垃圾
I guess people see those zeroes dance before their eyes,

238
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,010
都能够视而不见
it's kind of like highway hypnosis.

239
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,560
行了  到底什么情况
All right, so what's the problem?

240
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,160
对待这位富家公子哥的态度
Let's just say you and I

241
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,250
我没有你
don't wear the same rose-colored glasses

242
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,410
那么乐观
where Johnny Fabulous is concerned,

243
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,010
所以我查了他银行账户
so I kept an eye on his bank accounts,

244
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,710
调出了他信用记录
and I pulled his credit report.

245
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,880
还是注意下上面的时间吧
If you would, note the time on that.

246
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,810
昨天下午3:54
3:54 P.M. Yesterday.

247
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,450
就在从我那里离开三个钟头
Three hours after leaving my office.

248
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,840
他买了辆奔驰SL550
He bought a Mercedes SL550.

249
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,250
其实算租的  可也付了4500块
He's actually leasing it, but he put 4,500 down.

250
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,260
每月还要交1830
He's going to pay 1,830 a month--

251
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,450
够拽的吧
fully loaded.

252
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,840
我意思是他甚至搞了个电热方向盘
I mean, he even got the heated steering wheel,

253
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,540
这又多了6300块
but that's upwards of 6,300

254
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,020
不用向国税局申报
that won't be going to the IRS.

255
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,510
就是想让你知道这个
I just thought you might like to know,

256
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,840
就像我当初告诉过你的一样
loath as I am to say I told you so.

257
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,050
他现在在哪儿
Where is he now?

258
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,010
嗨
Hey.

259
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,410
怎么样
How you doing?

260
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,810
挺好
Good.

261
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,710
你呢
How are you?

262
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,650
我很好  不过你妈肯定担心得要死
I'm fine, but your mother is going to be worried sick.

263
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,880
昨晚上我给她打电话了
I called her last night.

264
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,080
跟她说我在路易斯家过夜
I told her I was spending the night at Louis'.

265
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,150
没事的
It's cool.

266
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,610
你...  怎么样了
So h-h-how are you?

267
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,150
孩子  我很好
I'm fine, son.

268
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,380
我...
I--

269
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,280
怎么说呢
I--

270
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,580
我找了些在门诊
I took these painkillers

271
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,650
剩下的止痛药
that I had left over from my surgery,

272
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,510
然后自以为是地
and I made the brilliant decision

273
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,910
就着点儿啤酒吃了
to wash them down with a couple of beers.

274
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,410
我承认  这不太明智
Not my most sterling moment, I admit,

275
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,810
不过我还好
but I'm fine.

276
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,120
昨天我真想过去
I wish I could take back last night.

277
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,919
你过生日  这些事情本来不该让你知道
It was your birthday. This shouldn't be on your mind.

278
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,779
没事的
It's okay.

279
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,210
怎么能没事呢
No, it's not okay.

280
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,840
我是你父亲
I'm your father,

281
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,610
不希望
and I don't want

282
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,080
昨天会是...
last night to be--

283
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:47,080
我是说你千万...
I mean, you really--

284
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,280
你千万别把我想成...
you can't think of me like...

285
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,110
想成什么
Like what?

286
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,110
我不明白
I don't understand.

287
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,750
我父亲死时候我才6岁
My father died when I was 6.

288
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,980
这个你知道吧
You knew that, right?

289
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,210
知道
Yeah.

290
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,050
他得了亨廷顿氏舞蹈症
He had Huntington's Disease.

291
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,940
这个病...
It's--

292
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,410
会损坏大脑某些区域
destroys portions of the brain,

293
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,880
影响到肌肉控制  会变成痴呆
affects muscle control, leads to dementia.

294
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,110
这病很难治
It's just a nasty disease.

295
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,310
还是遗传的
It's genetic.

296
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,480
我母亲很怕我也得了这个病
It terrified my mother that I might have it,

297
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,110
在我小时候就给我做了检查
so they ran tests on me when I was a kid,

298
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,810
不过我没事
but I came up clean.

299
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,550
我四五岁时候
My father fell very ill

300
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:51,480
父亲病得很重了
when I was 4 or 5.

301
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,380
天天住院
He spent a lot of time in the hospital.

302
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,550
我母亲...
My--

303
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,460
我母亲说了很多父亲的事
My mother would tell me so many stories about my father.

304
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,750
她不停地讲他
She would talk about him all the time.

305
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,080
我知道了他的个性
I knew about his personality,

306
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,010
如何待人接物
how he treated people.

307
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,150
甚至我都知道他点什么样的牛排
I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked--

308
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,610
三成熟
medium rare.

309
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,620
跟你一样
Just like you.

310
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,310
我了解了自己的父亲
I knew things about my father.

311
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,880
知道他很多情况
I had a lot of information.

312
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,710
因为别人会给我讲
It's because people would tell me these things.

313
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,250
这就为我勾勒出
They would paint this picture

314
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,650
一个父亲的形象
of my father for me,

315
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,810
我也总是假装
and I always pretended

316
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,410
那就是真正的父亲
that was who I saw, too,

317
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,070
记忆中的父亲
who I remembered,

318
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,210
其实不是这么回事
but it was a lie.

319
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,620
实际上  我对父亲真正的
In truth, I only have one real,

320
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,780
回忆只有一样
actual memory of my father.

321
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,480
应该就是在他临去世时候
It must've been right before he died.

322
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,610
我母亲带我去看他
My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him,

323
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,310
闻到的那种味道
and I remember the smell in there,

324
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,680
消毒水的味道
the chemicals.

325
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,580
就像是他们
It was as if they use up

326
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,050
用尽了方圆50英里内
every single cleaning product they could find

327
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,680
所有的清洁剂
in a 50-mile radius...

328
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,110
就为了不让人闻到病人身上的味道
like they didn't want you smelling the sick people.

329
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,110
到处是刺鼻的来苏水和漂白剂味儿
Oh, there was this stench of Lysol and bleach.

330
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,150
你能感到那味道一直冲到肺里
You could just feel it coating your lungs.

331
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,710
总之  病床上躺着的
Anyway, there, lying on the bed,

332
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,210
就是我的父亲
is my father.

333
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,580
他...整个人抽作一团
He's all... He's all twisted up.

334
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,850
我妈妈
And my mom,

335
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,350
把我抱在怀里
she puts me on her lap.

336
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,940
自己坐在病床上我父亲身边
She's sitting on the bed next to him

337
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,510
好让我能看到他
so I can get a good look at him...

338
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,550
可是他的样子让我害怕
but really he just scares me...

339
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,680
他直盯盯地看着我
and he's looking right at me...

340
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,250
我甚至都不确定他知不知道我是谁
but I can't even be sure that he knows who I am.

341
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,630
你奶奶一直在说话
And your grandmother is talking,

342
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,840
强颜欢笑  她一贯是那样的
trying to be cheerful, you know, as she does,

343
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,210
可是我唯一记得的
but the only thing I could remember

344
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,940
就是他的呼吸
is him breathing.

345
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,410
那是一种...一种
Oh, this... this...

346
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,180
空洞的声响
this rattling sound,

347
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,410
像是有人在摇晃一只空喷漆罐
like if you were shaking an empty spray-paint can.

348
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,580
就像他整个人已经被抽空了一样
Like there was nothing in him.

349
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,280
总之
Anyway...

350
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,350
这就是我对父亲的全部真实记忆
that is the only real memory that I have of my father.

351
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:11,180
我不想你记忆中的我是昨晚的样子
I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night.

352
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,810
我不希望我走了之后
I don't want that to be the memory you have of me

353
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,350
留给你的是那样的印象
when I'm gone.

354
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,050
记住那样的你
R-Remembering you that way...

355
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,180
也没什么不好
wouldn't be so bad.

356
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,840
只记得你过去一年来的样子
The bad way to remember you would be the way...

357
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,310
才是不好的
the way you've been this whole last year.

358
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,780
至少昨天晚上
At least last night you were...

359
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,150
你是真实的
you were real.

360
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,750
知道吗
You know?

361
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,940
再见
Bye.

362
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,810
有地方要去吧
Somewhere you should be?

363
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,400
只是临时的停业而已
Basically it was a temporary hiatus,

364
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,870
您等上两周
but you give us two weeks,

365
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,650
我们就百分百恢复运营了
we will be up and running 100%.

366
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,250
好  您商量好再联系我  成吗
All right, you talk to your people and get back to me. Okay?

367
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,710
谢谢  塔尼亚
Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

368
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,110
好  放心吧
Okay, you bet.

369
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,510
替我跟孩子们问好
Say hi to the kids for me.

370
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,970
你好
Hey. Hi.

371
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,940
真是意外呀
Nice surprise.

372
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,109
什么事
What's up?

373
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,810
我想过来看看  你近来如何
Just thought I'd swing by, see how things were going.

374
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,350
我这两天
Well, things are...

375
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,280
转运了
...things took a turn.

376
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,380
说来比较神奇
It's kind of crazy.

377
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,670
是吗
Oh, yeah?

378
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,150
我猜这就叫天无绝人之路
I think the universe is trying to tell me something.

379
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,950
我有好消息  非常好的消息
I've got some good news, some very good news,

380
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,660
正在张罗重新开业
and getting the business going again.

381
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,980
我想我们停业时间不长
Yeah, I figure we haven't been down long,

382
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,009
老客户应该还可以拉回来
so we should be able to get most of our old contracts back.

383
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:17,709
坐吧
Sit down.

384
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,410
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

385
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,110
那...那真是
That's... gosh, that's...

386
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,940
太好了
that's wow.

387
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,250
怎么做到的
How is that even possible?

388
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:34,210
我意外得到一笔资金注入
I got a very unexpected cash infusion.

389
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,940
可能是有人在暗中帮我
Guess someone's looking out for me.

390
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,910
可能是吧
I guess so.

391
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,880
外面那车是你的吗
Is that yours outside?

392
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,180
对  你也知道
Oh, yeah, you know.

393
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,509
总不能开辆烂车去见客户
Can't be driving a piece of crap to customer meetings.

394
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,109
得做出个成功生意人的形象才行
You've got to present that successful image.

395
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,480
对  有道理
Yeah, right, right.

396
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,110
这么说国税局的事...已经解决了吗
So the IRS stuff... that's resolved?

397
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,380
在处理中
Yeah, it's in progress.

398
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,750
你已经付钱给他们了
So you paid them?

399
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,280
还没有  不过我会付的
Well, not yet, but I will.

400
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,910
什么时候
When?

401
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,210
没那么简单
Well, it's not that simple.

402
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,980
问题是这样
Um, here's the thing.

403
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,210
我之前都没有做过正规法律咨询
I never had proper legal counsel,

404
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,690
所以我想
so I was thinking

405
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,590
我应该雇个好律师
I should hire someone good

406
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,880
帮我交涉出更好的和解条件
who can maybe hammer out a better deal.

407
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,980
不会有更好的条件了  泰德
There will never be a better deal, Ted.

408
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,550
条件是  缴了欠税
The deal is you pay your back taxes,

409
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,740
交了罚金
you pay your penalty,

410
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,680
你就不用蹲监狱
and you don't go to prison.

411
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,150
这就是好条件
That's a good deal,

412
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,050
我们不要节外生枝  行吗
so let's keep our priorities straight here, right?

413
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,840
我现在的主要工作是重新开张
Well, my priority is getting my business back

414
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,900
给我的员工发放工资
and putting my employees back on the payroll

415
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,450
让他们交得起按揭
so they can pay their mortgages.

416
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,110
没错  可是我想你的员工也会同意
Right, but I think your employees would agree

417
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,250
你应该先控制好自己的财务状况
that you need to get your financial situation in control

418
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,510
然后再帮助他们
before you can help them.

419
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:53,509
我的天  国税局雇你监督我吗
Boy, IRS got you on commission?

420
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,589
没有  我只是想说虽然...
No, I'm just saying that, though I really do...

421
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,240
我明白你东山再起的雄心
I understand the temptation to restart the business,

422
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,609
或许这笔意外之财的来意
maybe the universe is telling you

423
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,280
就是要你欠债还钱
that you need to pay what you owe.

424
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,180
斯凯勒  这是我的钱
Skyler, this is my money...

425
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,450
我为什么要跟你说这些
and why are we having this conversation?

426
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,509
你已经跟我毫无瓜葛了
You're no longer a part of my life...

427
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,150
而且  这也是你自己的决定
a decision you made, by the way...

428
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,780
我不明白你为什么要在这件事上逼我
so I don't understand why you're hectoring me about this.

429
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,709
泰德  这事影响到我们两个人
Ted, this affects both of us.

430
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,580
不  不是这样
No, it doesn't.

431
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,050
告诉你  你别再插手了
I'm telling you, you need to drop this.

432
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,110
你得在这个月底前
You need to use that money to pay your bill

433
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,900
用那笔钱付账单
by the end of this month,

434
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,009
你白纸黑字许诺过国税局
which you promised the IRS, in writing,

435
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,920
说你会还的
that you would do.

436
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,390
就这么简单
It is that simple.

437
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,010
好
Okay.

438
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,280
好  知道了
Okay, duly noted.

439
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,980
什么意思
What does that mean?

440
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,410
是肯定回答吗  我真的需要你肯定回答  泰德
Does that mean yes? Because I really need a yes here, Ted.

441
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,910
好吧  斯凯勒  我告诉你什么意思
All right, Skyler, I'll tell you what it means.

442
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,350
意思就是  我用最不失礼的方式来表达
It means, in the most respectful way possible,

443
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,470
门在那里
there's the door,

444
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,680
我请你...  你明白
and I'm inviting you to, you know--

445
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,800
谢谢你的关心
and thank you for your concern,

446
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,610
可我不想再提这件事了
but I'm done talking about this.

447
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,510
泰德  你以为是谁给了你60万
From whom exactly do you think you got that 600,000, Ted?

448
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,180
你的姑妈波吉特吗
Great-aunt Birgit?

449
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,350
是你
That was you?

450
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,280
对
Ya.

451
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,250
搞什么鬼
What is this shit?

452
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,910
我没有表决权吗
What, I don't get a vote?

453
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,070
我该永远留在这里吗
I'm supposed to just stay down here forever?

454
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,540
我答应你
I promise you this--

455
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,540
我们共进退
either we're all going home, or none of us are.

456
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,870
平静点
Now settle down.

457
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,140
站好
On your feet.

458
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,910
古斯塔沃
Gustavo.

459
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,830
我真高兴

460
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,460
你终于出人头地了

461
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,970
请允许我介绍我的毒师

462
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,690
这是你新的雇主
This is your new employer.

463
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,670
你称他为伊兰迪奥先生
You address him as Don Eladio.

464
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,710
这是礼貌称呼
It's a term of respect.

465
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,710
你好  年轻人

466
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,510
他一句西班牙语都不会说  对吗

467
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,409
对
No.

468
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,910
而且他不是化学家

469
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,610
这点你得知道

470
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,460
我不介意他是不是养猪的

471
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,090
他的冰毒做得比你们都好

472
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,490
你们还有那么多耀眼的学位的光环

473
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,720
而这个人

474
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,450
将有大量时间学习西语

475
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,700
是

476
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,420
是

477
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,110
那里面是什么

478
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,400
礼物吗

479
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,780
古斯塔沃  你太大方了

480
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,580
略表心意

481
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,960
象征了我们重新建立的友谊

482
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,510
我们来看看里面是什么

483
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,390
不是吧

484
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,190
蓝宝石酒

485
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,400
看看

486
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,990
连这瓶子都是件艺术品

487
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,200
太完美了

488
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,870
或许

489
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,540
这太珍贵了  没法分享

490
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,210
你觉得呢  古斯塔沃

491
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,420
送给您了  就该由您来定夺

492
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,380
我选择

493
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,180
喝了它

494
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,030
小心点

495
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,740
这可是好东西

496
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,860
你们要是溅出来一滴

497
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,660
我就让你们人头落地

498
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,780
赶紧  快点

499
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,000
古斯塔沃
Gustavo.

500
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,800
欢迎来到墨西哥
Welcome to Mexico.

501
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,000
你说
Now you say

502
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,530
"非常感谢  先生"
"Muchas gracias a usted, senor."

503
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,850
这人有酒瘾

504
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,030
要干活的话  得保持清醒

505
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,310
不能给你喝

506
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
干杯
Salud.

507
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,810
干杯
Salud.

508
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,300
干杯
Salud.

509
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,770
生意谈完了

510
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,680
把姑娘们带来

511
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,509
不  不  别  我不抽
Uh, no. Nah, I don't.

512
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,010
-来吧  -不行
- Come on. - No.

513
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,760
好吧
Okay.

514
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,620
古斯塔沃
Gustavo...

515
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,910
提起精神  伙计

516
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,700
古斯塔沃
Gustavo...

517
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,660
我没生气

518
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,380
我之前只能打你屁股

519
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,630
我还能有什么选择

520
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,970
听着  每二十年

521
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,590
你都得忘了你的地位

522
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:03,020
这件事上没有闹情绪的余地

523
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,150
你们所有人都得搞清楚

524
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,300
生意就是生意

525
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,620
失陪

526
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,780
你去哪里

527
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,160
用一下您的洗手间

528
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,040
可以吗

529
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,750
带古斯塔沃去洗手间

530
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,880
别让他迷路

531
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,850
快

532
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,510
别傻愣着  找把枪
Make yourself useful. Find a gun.

533
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,400
伊兰迪奥先生死了

534
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,530
他的分支头目也都死了

535
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,090
你们没必要血拼了

536
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,120
把枪收起来

537
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,570
安静地离开吧

538
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,130
你们也可以开火

539
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,090
然后受死

540
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,610
我希望能管用
I hope the hell that works.

541
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,090
扶住他
Take him.

542
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,350
钥匙
Keys.

543
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,210
不对
No.

544
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,810
不对
No.

545
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,700
好了  好了
Okay! Okay.

546
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,660
还撑得住吗
Are you still with us?

547
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,980
走
Go.

548
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,410
带我们走  孩子
Get us out of here, kid.
