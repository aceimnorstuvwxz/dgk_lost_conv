1
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,260
他们来了  他们就在门外
They're here. They're out front.

2
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,290
-几个人  -四个
- How many? - Four.

3
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,010
尼尔森・布雷  和另外三个人
Nelson Brey, three others.

4
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,190
-你拿了他的牙刷吗  -拿了
- Did you get his toothbrush? - Got it.

5
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,459
你的行李呢  要不这样吧
What about your stuff? Oh, you know what?

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,910
我们让他们开到你的住处停一下
We'll talk to them about stopping at your place.

7
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,160
斯凯勒  斯凯勒
Skyler-- Skyler...

8
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,490
-怎么了  -我不走
- What? - I'm not going.

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,760
什么
What?

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,230
我不去汉克和玛丽那里
I'm not going to Hank and Marie's

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,260
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,390
可你说过我们处境危险
But you said we're in danger.

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,630
是的  没错
Yes, that's true.

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,230
-那是因为我  -现在这不重要
- Because of me. - It doesn't matter now.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,480
重要的是
All that matters is--

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,490
重要的是你们其余人的安全
All that matters is that the rest of you are safe,

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,330
所以我才不能跟你走
and that's why I'm not going with you.

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,830
我才是他们要抓的人
I'm the real target.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,730
可是待在汉克家  我们都会没事的
But we'll all be safer at Hank's.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,090
不不不
That's-- No, no, no.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,960
如果我在那儿  就没有人会没事
No one will be safe at Hank's if I'm there.

22
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,760
沃特  他可是毒品管制局的人
Walt, it's DEA.

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,160
斯凯勒  你不了解这些人
Skyler, you don't know these people.

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,760
-可我  -不  斯凯勒  求你了
- I-  - No, Skyler, please,

25
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,960
相信我
trust me.

26
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,430
只能如此
This is how it has to be.

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,360
门外那些探员
Walt, those agents outside--

28
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,090
他们可不会扔下你不管
they're not going to just leave you here!

29
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,800
这才叫做保护性监禁
It's called protective custody.

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,020
他们只知道汉克一人
All they know is that Hank is the only person

31
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,760
目前有危险
that's in danger.

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,060
他们捎上我们  只是处于对玛丽的尊重
They're including us only as a courtesy to Marie,

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,190
让她宽心
just to keep her happy.

34
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,590
可我该怎么对玛丽  儿子
How am I supposed to explain that to Marie--

35
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,730
和汉克  解释这件事
or Junior or Hank, for that matter?

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,190
我不知道  但你必须解释
I don't know, but you'll do it.

37
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,930
你会想出法子的
You'll figure it out.

38
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,300
汉克知道玛丽会反应过激
Hank knows that Marie will be overreacting.

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,290
她肯定会焦躁不安
Except she's not.

40
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,330
我会去跟汉克说
I'll talk to Hank.

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,060
剩下所有人都交给你解释了
You just back me up with everyone else.

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,360
你真的希望我去说
You really expect me to say

43
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,690
"好了  沃尔特就待在那儿了..."
"Okay, Walt, sure, just stay here and..."

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,890
不  肯定还有别的办法
No, there's got to be another way.

45
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,190
没有了
There isn't.

46
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
曾经有过
There was,

47
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,930
但现在没有了
but now there isn't.

48
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,130
沃特
Walt,

49
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,460
你要多久才会安全
how long till you're safe,

50
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,890
才能脱身
till you can work this out?

51
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,360
斯凯勒
Oh, Skyler...

52
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,890
-斯凯勒  -不要
- Skyler-  - No.

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,590
这一年来  我备受死亡的威胁
I have lived under the threat of death for a year now,

54
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,790
因为它
and because of that,

55
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,000
我已经做出了选择
I've made choices.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,360
-沃尔特  -听我说
- Walt-  - Listen to me.

57
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,730
我一个人该承担这些选择
I alone should suffer the consequences

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,730
造成的后果  而不连累其他人
of those choices, no one else.

59
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,190
而这些后果
And those consequences--

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,730
就要来了
they're coming.

61
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,230
该来的总会来的
No more prolonging the inevitable.

62
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,530
系上背带  对  就从安全带扣里穿过去
Feed that belt-- yep, right through those seatbelt holders

63
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,360
非常感谢  汉克
Thank you so much. Hank,

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,890
洗车场还要营业
I've got a car wash to run.

65
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,630
我是说  你不会真觉得
I mean, you don't honestly believe

66
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,990
我会有危险吧  就凭我
that I'm in danger, do you? Me?

67
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,790
老天
Oh, Jesus,

68
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,780
弄得这么大张旗鼓的
everything's going to go over like a lead balloon.

69
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,440
玛丽一定会杀了我
It'll be Marie who kills me.

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,460
好了  就告诉你一声
All right, well, just know

71
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,690
我会尽快赶到那里
that I'll get there as soon as I can,

72
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,960
也通知史蒂芬・戈麦斯一声
and let Steve Gomez know.

73
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,480
我跟他那几个人说了  注意安全
I told some of his guys, and just stay safe.

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,600
拜托
Oh, please.

75
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,330
不至于那么夸张
Whole thing's just a giant jerk-off.

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,030
是啊是啊  但你还是小心为好
Yeah, yeah, but keep your head down anyway, all right?

77
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,660
好吧
All right.

78
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,030
兄弟  保重
All right, buddy, take care.

79
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,160
我知道
I know.

80
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,430
好了  我的宝贝  我们没事了
Okay, my love. We're okay.

81
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
好了  宝宝  没关系
Okay, baby. Honey, It's okay.

82
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,190
好了
Okay...

83
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,210
第四季 第十二集
S04E12: End Times

84
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,030
他为了这家愚蠢的洗车场连命都不要了
He's going to risk his life over a stupid car wash?

85
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,790
他明不明白
Does he even understand

86
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,930
汉克舅舅出的是什么事
what's going on with Uncle Hank?

87
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,630
他能来的时候自然会来
He'll come when he's able.

88
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,060
真可悲
That's pathetic.

89
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,130
你到底有没有努力说服他
How hard did you even try, or did you?

90
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,860
对你妈客气点
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Lay off your mom.

91
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,420
汉克  如果你和史蒂芬能让他来
Well, you know, Hank, we wouldn't even be arguing about this

92
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,030
我们就不必在这儿吵了
if you and Steve would just make him come.

93
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,460
你们为何不硬抓他上车
Why didn't your people put him in the car?

94
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,560
因为这里不是纳粹德国  好吗
Uh, because it's not Nazi German, all right?

95
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,170
什么纳粹德国啊
Oh, pl-- you-- Nazi Germany.

96
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,409
要是我每听到这话就能得到一块钱的话
If I had a dollar for every time

97
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:23,809
早就发了
I heard that.

98
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,740
知道吗  我要去给他打电话
You know what? I'm going to call him.

99
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,290
他必须立刻躲到这里来
He's going to get his behind here immediately.

100
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,890
没得商量
End of story.

101
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,429
谢谢你  至少还有人在听我说话
Thank you. At least somebody is listening to me.

102
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,490
因为我们都很危险
Because we are all in danger here.

103
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,009
我们没有都很危险
We are not all in danger.

104
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,330
你能别这么说吗
Will you stop saying that?

105
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,510
这就是自找麻烦
That is asking for trouble.

106
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,330
接电话  沃尔特
Oh, come on, Walt.

107
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,360
他不接电话
He's not picking up.

108
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,060
我们能都放轻松一点吗
Look, could we just take this down a notch?

109
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,630
行吗  各位
Okay, everybody?

110
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,290
斯凯  你们在这儿想待多久都行
Sky, you guys can stay here as long as you like, okay?

111
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,490
我们有足够的房间
We've got plenty of room.

112
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,630
但我不必担心沃尔特或我们任何人的安全
But I wouldn't worry about any danger to Walt or any of us.

113
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,390
好吗
Okay?

114
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,430
这整件事只是烟幕弹
This whole thing's just a damn smoke screen.

115
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,290
你什么意思  烟幕弹
How do you mean a-- a smoke screen?

116
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,230
给我写什么匿名恐吓
An anonymous threat against me?

117
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,110
我都坐上轮椅了  我甚至不在岗位上
I'm stuck in a wheelchair. I'm not even on the job.

118
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,310
错了  是有人不满意我最近的业余活动
No, someone doesn't like the way I've been spending my free time.

119
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,190
什么活动  买矿石吗
What, minerals?

120
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,580
你不觉得太巧了吗
Timing seem a bit odd to you, huh?

121
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,930
你看  我才刚开始查那个谁
I mean, I start looking into, you know...

122
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,960
福林  突然之间就被禁足了
Fring, and all of a sudden I'm under lockdown for my...

123
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,930
等一下  你说谁
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,460
古斯・福林
Gus Fring?

125
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,470
炸鸡店老板
From the chicken restaurant?

126
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,060
汉克  你说的是什么呀
Hank, what are you talking about?

127
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,360
个人观点
Just one man's humble opinion.

128
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,630
仅此而已
That's all,

129
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,560
不过我认为洛博罗炸鸡馆
but I think Los Pollos Hermanos

130
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,590
是西南最大冰毒贩的幌子
is a front for the biggest meth distributor in the Southwest

131
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,630
我的上帝  史蒂芬
Oh, my God. Steve...

132
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,230
我的上帝  你们...有在查这件事吗
Oh, my God. Are you-- Are you even looking into this?

133
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,460
我们不会放过任何线索
We're looking into everything,

134
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,790
但是我们的行动必须基于事实而非猜测
but we work on fact, not conjecture,

135
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,090
事实就是  当初袭击你的王八蛋
and the fact is that the scumbags that hit you first

136
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,360
来自墨西哥贩毒集团
were Mexican cartel,

137
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,460
不是什么德资跨国集团
not some German multinational whatever,

138
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,530
更不是肯德基上校[指福林]
and definitely not Colonel Sanders.

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,860
哪怕我们有一丁点儿的证据
Now, if we even had a shred of proof--

140
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,090
给你薪水不就是让你找证据的吗
Isn't that what you get paid to go get?

141
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,360
记得我跟你讲过的洗衣店吧
Remember that laundry I told you about?

142
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,160
是我就从那边开查
I'd start there.

143
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,560
想想啊  兄弟
Come on, man.

144
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,590
完美的冰毒实验室选址
It's a perfect spot for a meth superlab.

145
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,760
我的上帝
Oh, my God.

146
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,560
万一我猜对了呢
What if I'm right?

147
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,960
即便你猜对了
Even if you were right--

148
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,590
虽然那不可能
and you ain't--

149
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,530
但是就算你猜对了  我也绝对没有可能
but if you were, there's no way in hell

150
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,960
拿到法官批准的搜查令
a judge is going to give me a search warrant--

151
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,190
要搜查令干什么
Search warrant?

152
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,630
直接上门访谈的好传统被丢弃了吗
What happened to good, old-fashioned knock and talk?

153
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,130
哦对  我忘了
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

154
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,530
那从来不是你长项  是不是
You were never very good at those, were you?

155
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,560
-要帮忙吗  -这样的  先生
- Can I help you? - Yes, sir.

156
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,430
我和我兄弟们能不能在你这查一下
My friend and I... we wondered if we could take a look around.

157
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,760
为什么
Why?

158
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,830
-不好意思  你叫什么  -丹尼斯
- Sorry, what's your name? - Dennis.

159
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,130
丹尼斯  我是史蒂芬・戈麦斯
Dennis. Hey, I'm Steve Gomez.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,830
毒品管制局  禁毒署的
I'm with the DEA, Drug Enforcement.

161
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,290
怎么了  有什么问题吗
What, is there-- there a problem?

162
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,960
没问题  没你的事
Not for you. No, no problem.

163
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,850
我们只是想检查一下
We're just wondering if we could take a look around.

164
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,740
我...
I, uh--

165
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,190
能给你讲个事吗
Can I tell you a story?

166
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,860
-行啊  -我抓到一个厨师
- Yeah. - I bust this chef.

167
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,290
他自称是厨师
Well, he says he's a chef,

168
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,130
可是在餐厅打工
but just because you work at a restaurant

169
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,760
一个汉堡卖到14块
that charges $14 for a burger,

170
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,290
不能算是厨师
that don't make you a chef.

171
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,760
顶多是个有手艺的做汉堡的
That makes you a glorified burger flipper,

172
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,960
至少我是这么认为
at least in my book.

173
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,990
总之吧
Anyway,

174
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,730
我们抓了这个携带海洛因的厨师
so we bust this chef-- heroin possession.

175
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,630
他就狡辩  "你们在我工装兜里
He says, "Well, just because you found heroin

176
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,390
找到海洛因也不能证明就是我的
"In my chef whites doesn't make it mine.

177
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,930
说不准是洗工装的洗衣房放进去的呢"
Maybe it came from the place that launders my chef whites"

178
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,360
就是你家了
this place.

179
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,390
老哥  我们这儿可没有那东西
Oh, come on, man. I don't want to do this stuff with you.

180
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,830
我懂我懂
I-I know, I know.

181
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,660
不用你说  我也清楚
You don't have to say it. I'll say it for you.

182
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,660
他就是满嘴胡编乱扯
His story is a big load of steaming horse shit.

183
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,959
你这儿能找到海洛因
I mean, we're going to find heroin here

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,730
拉登早都抓住了
like we're going to find Jimmy Hoffa. Right?

185
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,230
问题是  这厨子的老爹
The thing is, is that the chef's daddy

186
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,460
是联邦参议员
is a United States Senator.

187
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,040
我不告诉你是哪个
I'm not going to tell you which one,

188
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,690
你八成也能猜出来  是吧
but you probably know who he is, right?

189
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,790
所以现在我的浪费时间
So now I've got to waste my time

190
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,260
核实这个做汉堡的编的瞎话
checking out this burger flipper's story,

191
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,630
如果我不查  他老子就会给我小鞋穿
and if I don't, his old man's going to jam me up,

192
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,440
给我的助手  我们整个组的人穿
my ASAC, my whole entire office.

193
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,330
政客难缠啊
Politics, huh?

194
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,590
你意下如何
So what do you think?

195
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,490
是这么回事
Listen, you know what?

196
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,230
我得跟老板请示  他出城去了
I have to check with my boss, and he's out of town,

197
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,830
我也不能保证很快联系到他
and I can't promise I'll reach him anytime soon either, you know?

198
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,990
那就只好这么办了
Well, yeah, that's probably the way to go,

199
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,850
我得申请搜查令
so I'll have to go get a warrant,

200
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,290
一切按部就班来
and we'll do it official,

201
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,260
那样的话你们今天就得停业
but you're probably going to have to close down for the day.

202
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,390
什么  为什么
What-- why?

203
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,330
二十个探员四处查看
Twenty agents poking around?

204
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,930
想想吧  只我们俩来岂不是少了很多麻烦
Come on, it'll be less trouble if it was just us two,

205
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,090
你决定
but your call.

206
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,890
只有你们两个
Just the two of you?

207
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,260
你们会很快的是吧
You'll make it quick, right?

208
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,090
丹尼斯  我们来去如风
Dennis, we'll be like the wind.

209
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,360
那成
O-Okay.

210
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,560
-你跟他说  -行啦
- Could you tell him? Okay.

211
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,230
成啦
Okay.

212
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,390
丹尼斯  能不能帮忙把工人请出去
Oh, and, Dennis, can you clear out some of your people for us?

213
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,930
免得狗嗅错了
Confuses the dog's nose.

214
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,960
需要关机安静多久
So how long we gotta be quiet down her?

215
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,300
之后会怎么样
Then what happens after this,

216
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,890
假如他们没发现地下室  把我们都逮走的话
provided they don't find their way in here and bust our asses?

217
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,960
我是不是就  这辈子都
I'm gonna be, like, stuck down here in a laundry hamper

218
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,790
困在洗衣房地下了
for the rest of eternity?

219
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,360
我这话你记住
No, I'm going on record.

220
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,160
真是操蛋
This-- This blows.

221
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,590
喂
Hello.

222
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,730
找你
For you.

223
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,590
是我
Yeah?

224
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,190
你知不知道地面上发生了什么事
Do you know what's happening upstairs?

225
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,390
我清楚得很
I have a pretty good idea.

226
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,290
这都是拜你的前搭档所赐
This is all the result of your former partner.

227
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,530
你现在懂了吗
Do you understand now?

228
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,230
为什么不能这样下去
Do you see why this can't continue?

229
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,130
我都明白
You know, I get it.

230
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,930
他是个混账王八蛋
The guy's a complete and total dick,

231
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,990
可我不能
but I can't--

232
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,430
我说过的话没变
I'm not signing off.

233
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,430
懂吗
Okay?

234
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,830
我之前说过了
Like I said,

235
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,090
如果怀特老师
if something final

236
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,630
有个三长两短
happens to Mr. White,

237
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,610
你我就有麻烦了
we are going to have a problem.

238
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,160
你打算怎么做
So what are you going to do?

239
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,730
我会做出适当的回应
There will be an appropriate response.

240
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,030
适当  是什么意思
Appropriate? What does that mean?

241
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,410
喂
Hello?

242
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,670
他们走了
They're gone.

243
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,370
可以开工了
We're good.

244
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,650
请在嘀声后  留下你的姓名
At the tone, please state your name,

245
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,490
电话号码  和打来的原因
number, and the reason for your call.

246
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,550
谢谢合作
Thank you.

247
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,409
你有六条新留言
You have six new messages.

248
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,559
孩子  是我  古德曼
Hey, kid, it's me, Goodman.

249
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,410
速度给我回电
Give me a call, would you?

250
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,609
喂  急需和你谈谈
Hey, need to hear from you. All right?

251
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,209
我想我已经说的很清楚了
Hope I made myself clear about that.

252
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,060
尽快给我回电
Call me as soon as you can.

253
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,710
平克曼  快给我过来  速度
Pinkman, get over here. Stat, pronto.

254
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,470
别打电话  给我直接过来
Don't call. Just get over here.

255
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,730
你能不能  求你了
Would you just...? Please.

256
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,660
我不知道是不是你听不懂我的话
I don't know if I'm speaking English here--

257
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,800
怎么了  他在等我
What's up? He's waiting for me, yo.

258
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,080
稍等  稍等
Hold up, hold up.

259
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,970
你干什么  老兄
The hell, man?

260
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,140
别碰我
Get off of me!

261
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,040
古德曼  快给我出来
Hey, Goodman! Get out here!

262
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,510
别碰我
Get-- Hey!

263
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,789
你个变态别碰我
Yo, get your goon off me.

264
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,240
不是他  白痴  放下  坐下
Not him, moron. Drop. Leave it. Go lie down.

265
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,670
对不起  这几天不得不得小心点
Sorry, you can't be too careful these days.

266
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,440
快进来  把门锁上  弗里斯基
Come on, come on. Lock the door, Frisky.

267
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,470
我的天哪
Jesus.

268
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,340
去休息一下吧  H.T  去吧
Take a break, H.T. Let's go.

269
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,710
别再这么叫我
You're going to stop calling me that,

270
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,340
不然我就用你的领带绞死你
or I'm going to hang you by your tie.

271
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,810
好  好  别再客户面前卖弄了
Yeah, yeah, stop showing off for the client.

272
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,140
亲爱的小咪咪  是说你很讨人喜爱
Honey Tits. I say it's endearing.

273
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,810
什么事这么重要
So what's so important?

274
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,040
他们来了
Well, they're here--

275
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,440
没时间了  孩子
the end times, kid.

276
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,840
没时间了
End times.

277
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,270
什么意思
What's that mean?

278
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,770
为什么你把我拉来这
And why the hell you drag me down here for?

279
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,600
你想要你的钱不是吗
You want your money, don't you?

280
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
我想你应该想
I assume that you do.

281
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,010
什么  这有什么好急的
What, that couldn't wait?

282
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,470
你听说过人间蒸发这个词吗  孩子
You ever hear the expression "A fart in the wind," Kid?

283
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,640
我在一个小时内就会这样了
Well, inside of an hour, that's going to be me, okay?

284
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,940
我要跑路了  我要离开这里
I'm hitting the road. I'm gone. I'm out of here.

285
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,110
你说什么  真的走了
What, for, like, good?

286
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,540
因为必须如此
For as long as it takes.

287
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,140
你懂我的意思的话  我不想把话说得太明
I don't like my heat so hot, if you catch my drift.

288
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,600
我不懂你到底在说什么
I'm not catching, like, anything you're saying,

289
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,870
你到底怎么了
and what the hell is your problem?

290
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,810
你没和你搭档说过话吧
You haven't talked to your partner, have you?

291
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
从昨晚开始就没有
No, not since last night.

292
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,470
今天他都没来工作
Today he didn't show up to work,

293
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,870
毒品管制局还正好来突击搜查
and the DEA just happened to, like, raid us.

294
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:28,070
没错  有点太巧了  对吧
Yeah, some coincidence, huh?

295
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,570
这我倒是不清楚
Yeah, I don't know about that.

296
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,959
我只知道  他告诉我
All I know is when he tells me

297
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,810
你们的雇主把他带到沙漠里
that your employer took him out in the desert

298
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
然后威胁要灭他全家
and threatened to murder his entire family,

299
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,540
我突然想到
I sit up and take notice

300
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,240
因为毕竟我不是他的家人  我会被怎么样
because, hey, after all, what am I if not family?

301
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,970
你在说什么
What are you-- What are you talking about?

302
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,610
什么时候的事情
When did that happen?

303
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,709
我不知道  当我没说
I don't know. Forget it.

304
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,210
他有点夸张了  他经常这样
He-- He exaggerates, right? He does that.

305
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,210
听着  帮我个忙
Hey, listen, do me a favor.

306
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,340
能在福林面前说说我好话吗
Would you put in a good word for me with Fring?

307
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,770
看在我们这么久交情上
I mean, just for old time's sake.

308
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,640
这些话我真说不出口
I can't afford to butter the wrong bread here.

309
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,010
明白了吧
Yeah.

310
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,740
没有发现  是吗
Nothing, huh?

311
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,210
非常干净
Clean as a whistle,

312
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,110
他也这么说
so he says.

313
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,750
这里是沃尔特・怀特
You have reached Walter White.

314
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,350
请在嘀声后  留下你的姓名
At the tone, please state your name,

315
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,020
电话号码  和打来的原因
number, and the reason for your call.

316
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,090
谢谢合作
Thank you.

317
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,340
还是我
It's me again.

318
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,780
真希望你能接电话
I really wish you'd pick up.

319
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,640
天呐  我只是
God, I just--

320
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,970
给我回个电话  好吗
Call me back, okay?

321
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,570
给我回个电话  求你了
Just-- Just call me back, please.

322
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,970
很抱歉  我能在这里呆一会吗
Hi, I'm sorry. Is it okay if I come out here for a few minutes?

323
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,770
当然  别出去就行
Yeah, sure, just stay up here, if you would.

324
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,630
打扰了  我想问
Excuse me, I wonder

325
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,110
你有烟么
if you have a-- an extra cigarette?

326
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,910
我现在想抽支烟
I sure could use a smoke right about now.

327
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,640
当然
Sure.

328
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,640
谢谢
Thank you.

329

奶奶正陪着他
Grandma's with him.

338

How's he doing? Tell me what's going on?

340
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,870
医生们说  他们也不知道这是什么
The doctors-- they don't know what it is exactly.

341
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,670
他就像得了流感一样
It's like-- It's like he's got the flu,

342
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,370
可他的情况却越来越糟
but-- but he just keeps getting worse.

343
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,510
杰西  我不明白
Jess, I don't understand.

344

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,920
我  我想布洛克
I'm-- I'm thinking Brock

377
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,670

听起来像米饭的发音
It sounds like "Rice."

381
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,310
你得去告诉医生
You need to tell the doctors about it.

382

你为什么这么说  你怎么知道
Why would you say that? How do you know?

383
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,609
那不重要  只要告诉他们  这是个猜想
It doesn't matter. Just tell them, it's a guess.

384
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,739
明白吗  蓖麻毒素
Okay? Ricin.

咱们得谈谈
We need to talk.

396
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,940
你跟谁一起
Who's with you?

397
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,410
没别人  就我  让我进去
No one, just me. Let me in.

398
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,070
居然跑来这里  真不知道你怎么想的
I don't know what you're thinking coming here.

399
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,910
天啊
Oh, Christ.

400
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,840
现在还有关系么
What does it matter?

401
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,840
所有的  所有的一切都要结束了
Everything, it's all-- all coming to an end.

402
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,570
你到底知不知道发生了什么
Do you even know what's happening?

403
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,810
从头到尾发生了什么
the full scope of what's happening?

404
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,410
他们把我带去了沙漠
They took me out into the desert.

405
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,010
用布蒙住了我的头
They put a hood over my head

406
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,570
然后开车把我拉到沙漠
and drove me out into the desert,

407
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,640
要我跪下
on my knees.

408
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,570
他们用我的家人恐吓我
They threatened my family,

409
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,010
不光是汉克
and not just Hank.

410
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,900
还有我的妻子  我的孩子
My wife, my children...

411
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,540
现在只是时间早晚的问题
It's just a matter of time now.

412
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,240
我现在还能保护他们
I was-- I was able to protect them for now,

413
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,440
但是
but...

414
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,570
古斯会马上采取行动
Gus is going to make his move...

415
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,410
我  我不知道时间
and I don't-- I don't know when.

416
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,510
我不知道地点  也不知道方式
I don't know where or how.

417
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,970
我只知道马上就要开始了
All I know is it's going to happen.

418
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,810
而我无力阻挡
And I'm powerless to stop him.

419
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,240
你在干什么
What are you doing?

420
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,770
你干了什么
Why did you do it?

421
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,940
为什么
Why?

422
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,540
杰西  古斯逼得我别无选择
Jesse, Gus gave me no choice.

423
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,370
我不得不打电话给毒品管制局
I had to call the DEA

424
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,610
来保护我的家人
to protect my family.

425
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,710
我还能怎么做
What else could I do?

426
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,610
不  不  你个婊子养的
No. No, you son of a bitch.

427
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,709
你知道你做了什么
You know what you did.

428
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,210
冷静  冷静
Okay, look, just--

429
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,270
把枪放下
just put the gun down.

430
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,440
好吧  把枪放下  我们谈谈
Okay? Just put it down, and we'll talk.

431
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,510
行吗
All right?

432
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,910
你告诉我  告诉我  你认为我做了什么
You tell me-- tell me what it is you think I did.

433
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,670
布洛克  你为什么要给他下毒
Brock-- why did you poison him?

434
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,009
谁是布洛克
Who's Brock?

435
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,010
你昨晚在我客厅里见过他
You saw him in my living room just last night.

436
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,209
你走到我门前  直接就看到他了
You came to my door, and you looked right at him,

437
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,310
别跟我说你不认识他
so don't tell me you don't know him.

438
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,140
那个男孩
The boy.

439
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,870
杰西  我完全不知道那些人是谁
Jesse, I have no idea who these people are.

440
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,210
现在  拜托  好吧  是布洛克
Now, please-- Okay, that's Brock,

441
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,810
是他被下毒了吗
and-- and he was poisoned?

442
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,220
蓖麻毒素  他快死了
The ricin! He's dying

443
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,150
因为有人给了他蓖麻毒素
because someone gave it to him,

444
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,110
而你我二人
and only you and I

445
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,910
是这个世界上唯二
were the only two people on earth

446
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,570
知道这点的人
who knew about it.

447
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,010
等一下
Now wait a minute.

448
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,109
等一下
Wait a minute.

449
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,759
也许他去翻了你的口袋  然后
Maybe he went into your pockets and accid--

450
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,770
不
No!

451
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,510
我有
I had it.

452
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,140
今天早上我的口袋里还有蓖麻香烟
I had the cigarette with the ricin in my pack this morning.

453
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,940
我最后一次看见布洛克是在昨天晚上
The last time I saw Brock was last night,

454
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,140
今天早上  我把香烟换到了新口袋里
and this morning I switched the cigarette into a new pack.

455
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,370
布洛克根本没可能自己拿到
There's no way Brock took it himself.

456
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,810
杰西  你根本没想明白
Jesse, you're not thinking clearly.

457
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,440
听着  你自己说的
Listen, you said it yourself

458
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,870
你今天早上还有
that you had it this morning.

459
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,270
那我怎么可能拿到
Then when could I have possibly gotten it?

460
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,770
你  你让索尔做的
You-- You had Saul do it.

461
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,410
-什么  -对
- What? - Yeah.

462
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,570
对  我过去他的办公室
Yeah, I went to his office.

463
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,540
他打电话给我  说今天一定要见我
He called me and just had to see me today.

464
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,810
他那个大块头保镖搜遍了我全身
His big man-mountain bodyguard patted me down.

465
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,210
他肯定是那时候偷走的  对吗
That's when he must've stolen it off of me, right?

466
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,910
这就是你们的计划  是不是
That's the plan? Was that the plan?

467
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,510
杰西  为什么
Jesse, why?

468
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,140
为什么  看在上帝的份上
Why, in God's name,

469
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,870
我为什么要给一个孩子下毒
would I poison a child?

470
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,340
为了报复我
To get back at me.

471
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,010
因为我在帮古斯
Because I'm helping Gus,

472
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,670
这就是你报复的方式
and this is your way

473
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,110
你要在你死之前把我的心活活撕开
of ripping my heart out before you're dead and gone.

474
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,070
快承认
Just admit it.

475
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,440
承认你的罪行
Admit what you did.

476
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,540
快承认
Admit it!

477
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,740
我什么也没做
I did not do this!

478
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,440
闭嘴
Shut up!

479
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,840
别再撒谎
Stop lying!

480
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,240
我没  我没撒谎
I'm not-- I'm not lying.

481
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,870
我没撒谎  你听我说
I'm not lying. Just listen to me.

482
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,510
听我说  我有什么好处呢
Listen to me. What would I have to gain?

483
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,270
怎么可能  怎么可能会
What possible, possible could--

484
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,770
谁  谁会
Who-- who would--

485
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,640
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

486
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,110
嗨
Hey.

487
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
别笑了
Stop laughing.

488
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,270
别笑了
Stop laughing!

489
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,340
我一直在等
I have been waiting.

490
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,710
我等了一整天
I have been waiting all day,

491
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,710
等着古斯
waiting for Gus to send

492
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,640
派他的某个手下来杀我
one of his men to kill me...

493
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,110
居然是你
and it's you.

494
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,510
你知道谁
Who do you know

495
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,670
谁对于利用孩子毫不愧心吗  杰西
who's okay with using children, Jesse?

496
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,670
你知道谁可以任由一个孩子被杀而无动于衷吗
Who do you know who has allowed children to be murdered?

497
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,610
是古斯
Hm? Gus!

498
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,870
他总是先发制人
He has-- He has been 10 steps ahead of me at every turn,

499
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,970
只有征得了你的同意
and now the one thing that he needed

500
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,740
他才能除掉我
to finally get rid of me is your consent,

501
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,910
现在他得逞了
and, boy, he's got that now.

502
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,410
你妥协了
He's got it.

503
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,940
而且他不仅得到了你的同意
And not only does he have that,

504
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,710
还操控你
but he manipulated you

505
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,240
成为了他的枪手
into pulling the trigger for him.

506
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,109
只有我们俩知道蓖麻毒素的事
Only you and I knew about the ricin!

507
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,470
才怪  你根本不相信
No! You don't even believe that

508
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,770
古斯的摄像头无处不在
Gus' cameras everywhere.

509
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,470
拜托  你听听自己的心声
Please. Listen to yourself.

510
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,210
他知道  他自始至终都无所不知
No, he has known everything all along.

511
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,270
你今天都去了哪里  实验室吗
Where were you today? In the lab?

512
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,940
难道你觉得不可能是
And you don't think it's possible

513
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,210
是泰鲁斯把你柜子里的香烟拿出来的吗
that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker?

514
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,810
别傻了
Come on.

515
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,710
你还看不出来吗
Don't you see?

516
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,440
你是最后一块拼图
You are the last piece of the puzzle.

517
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,670
你正是他所需要的一切
You are everything that he's wanted.

518
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,770
你现在成了他的毒师
You're his cook now.

519
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,510
你成了毒师  你还证明了
You're the cook, and you have proven

520
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,310
没有我  你也可以称得起一间实验室
that you can run a lab without me,

521
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,310
现在你这位毒师有理由杀我了
and now that cook has reason to kill me.

522
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,240
好好想想吧
Think about it!

523
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,370
计划太妙了
It's brilliant.

524
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,910
那你动手吧
So go ahead.

525
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,040
动手
Go ahead.

526
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,670
如果你认为我有能力做这件事  那就动手吧
If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead.

527
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,870
把子弹射入我脑门
Put a bullet in my head

528
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,710
立马杀了我
and kill me right now.

529
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,190
动手
Do it!

530
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,890
动手
Do it.

531
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,160
我会动手的
I'll do it.

532
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,520
动手
Do it.

533
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,860
动手
Do it.

534
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,560
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

535
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,709
我要去找那狗杂种
I'm going to find the son of a bitch,

536
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,609
然后毙了他
and I'm going to kill him.

537
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,870
不  别去
No, don't.

538
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,700
他会知道你过去的
He'll see you coming.

539
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,820
你靠近他前就死了
You'll die before you get anywhere near him.

540
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,090
我才不管
I don't care.

541
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,760
杰西  杰西  你只要上车
Jesse. Jesse, just get in your car.

542
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,390
开走就好
Just go.

543
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,810
开走就好
Just drive.

544
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,620
不  怀特老师  不管怎样  我都会杀了他
No, I'm going to do this one way or another, Mr. White.

545
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,510
那让我帮你
Then let me help.

546
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,110
天呐  平克曼先生
Oh, Jesus, Mr. Pinkman,

547
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,720
我不想对你重复了
I'm not going to keep telling you.

548
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,660
除非征得家属允许
Unless the family wants you in there,

549
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,960
不然你不能进来
you're not allowed.

550
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,110
你不能总这样擅自进来
You can't keep coming in here like this.

551
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,800
听到了吗  听得懂吗
You hear me? You understand?

552
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:22,260
平克曼先生  我得叫保安了
Mr. Pinkman, I'm going to call security.

553
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,350
好了  来吧
All right, here we go.

554
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,750
快走吧
Come on now.

555
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,326
平克曼先生  我最后警告你一遍
Mr. Pinkman, final warning.

556
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,770
你现在该去干活了
You need to be at work now.

557
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,870
我告诉过你了  我不去
I already told you. I'm not going.

558
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,000
你这批货要作废了
You've got a batch that will be ruined

559
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,970
如果真作废了
and an employer who will be very upset

560
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,230
老板会不高兴的
if that happens.

561
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,700
你以为我会在乎吗
And I could give a shit.

562
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,630
我不走
I'm not leaving here.

563
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,530
如果我老板不满意
If my employer has a problem with that,

564
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,530
他可以自己跟我说
he can tell me himself,

565
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,530
而不是让他的小跟班来传话
not his errand boy.

566
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,770
给我...
Get--

567
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,300
我不认识这个人
Hey, I don't know this guy!

568
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,600
叫保安来
Call Security!

569
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,000
有人打我
I'm being attacked!

570
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,410
好  这就对了
Yeah, that's right.

571
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,570
这里有情况
We've got a situation.

572
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,800
<i>他应该 注意到我了</i>

573
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,370
他要跟你说话
He'd like to speak with you.

574
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,230
我告诉过你  我不走
I told you, I'm not leaving.

575
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,330
他就在楼下
He's downstairs.

576
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,830
泰鲁斯把情况都向我汇报了
Tyrus told me what's happening--

577
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,600
那个孩子的病情
the sick child.

578
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,530
我能理解你有急事
I understand your preoccupation,

579
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,030
可是  杰西  我有生意要做
but, Jesse, I am running a business.

580
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,900
我需要你回到实验室把活干完
I need you back at the lab to complete the cook.

581
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,700
你干完就能回来了
You can return when you're done.

582
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,630
不行
I can't.

583
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,370
你一定清楚  这样对我们双方都好
It is, as you must know, in both of our best interests.

584
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,530
楼上那个小男孩快死了
That little boy upstairs is dying.

585
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,230
我不能走  我也根本不想待在这里
I can't be away. I don't even want to be here now.

586
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,209
如果他有什么三长两短  我不能不在身边
I can't be away if something happens, if he--

587
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,600
我深感遗憾
I am very sorry.

588
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,070
我可以帮得上忙吗
Is there anything I can do?

589
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,670
我是这家医院的股东
I am on the board of this hospital.

590
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,300
我可以推荐医生给你
I can recommend doctors,

591
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,300
确保能满足他的一切所需
make sure he gets whatever he needs,

592
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,870
获得最好的治疗
the best treatment.

593
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,630
他没病
He's not sick.

594
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,670
他是被下毒了
He was poisoned.

595
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,500
怎么会
How did that happen?

596
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,810
那些医生
The doctors--

597
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,430
也不知道
they don't know.

598
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,930
这批货
This current batch...

599
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,170
现在一定是废了
is surely ruined now.

600
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,710
对吗
Correct?

601
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,710
陪着这个孩子
Stay with the boy.

602
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,300
泰鲁斯会销毁这批货  然后清理容器
Tyrus will dump what's there and clean the tanks.

603
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,370
你到时再做一批新的
You will start a new batch

604
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,070
等你下周准备好
when you are ready to return...

605
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,670
回归
next week.

606
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,100

Keep going.

609
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,130
为什么停步
Why'd you stop?

610
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,420
为什么停步

00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,170

00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,510

00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,010
快  快
Come on, come on.

拜托

616
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,530
不  不  不  别走
No, no, no. No, don't go.

617
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,000

Don't go, don't go, don't go.

618
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,430
