13
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,074
美国船长
Captain America.

14
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:57,078
-你好  兄弟  -你好  兄弟
- What's up, brother?  - Hey, bro.

15
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:15,039
这主意太蠢了
This is stupid.

16
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,007
你有更好的主意吗
You got a better idea?

17
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,019
好吧  无所谓了
Okay, fine. Whatever.

18
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:22,043
那我们什么时候
So when do we, you know?

19
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:24,072
暂时不动手
We don't, for now.

20
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,087
等一切安顿好了再开始制毒
No cooking until things settle down.

21
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,016
安顿
Settle down?

22
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:30,083
你不是说事情不会有变化吗
I thought you're the one that said nothing's changed.

23
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,049
听着  我让家人担惊受怕深受折磨
Look, I just put my family through an ordeal

24
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,096
他们才刚开始接受我的现状  明白吗
That they're just now starting to accept, okay?

25
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:37,038
我不能
I can't...

26
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,035
这个太贵了
Ah, that's too expensive.

27
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,017
听着  我离家超过20分钟
Look, I can't leave my house

28
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:55,062
我老婆就开始担心
For more than 20 minutes without my wife worrying.

29
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:57,083
我需要时间来改善我们的关系
I need time to mend fences.

30
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:00,084
你要改善关系  那我怎么办
So while you're fixing fences,what about me, huh?

31
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:04,059
你那个混蛋小舅子把我的钱都收走了
Your A-hole brother-in-law took all my money.

32
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:18,062
这里有600块
That's $600.

33
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:19,097
剩下的那些钱呢
What about the rest?

34
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:24,086
-什么  -你那一半钱都是我的
- Rest of what?  - Half your money's mine.

35
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:27,021
说好55分成的  这不是你的生意经吗
You know,50/50 partners.That's your business motto.

36
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:30,047
你这么说什么意思  你犯错  我买单吗
Meaning what, exactly?That I suffer for your carelessness?

37
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,015
是你想跟屠库合作
You're the one who wanted to work with Tuco.

38
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,092
要不是因为这个  就不会搞成这样
If it weren't for that, none of this would've happened.

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,060
稍后再谈  好吗
We'll talk about this later, okay?

40
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:49,013
目前就不要联系了  明白吗
As for now, no contact. Understood?

41
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,063
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

42
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,032
我先走
I leave first.

43
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,033
沃尔特
Walt!

44
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,027
在厨房呢
In the kitchen.

45
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,041
你怎么还动起了炉子
I didn't know you were allowed to touch the stove.

46
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,009
搞笑呢  葛罗卓[名小丑]
Hilarious, Groucho.

47
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,032
去吧  快坐下
Go on, grab a seat.

48
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,002
桌上有果汁
Juice is on the table.

49
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,008
-早上好  宝贝儿  -嗨  妈妈
- Good morning, honey.  - Hey, Mom.

50
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,042
老爸正做早饭呢
Dad's cooking breakfast.

51
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:58,077
放心  盘子我也由我来洗
But don't worry.I'm also doing all the dishes.

52
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,025
不错吧  跟我来
Nice? Follow me.

53
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,034
还有橙汁和葡萄柚汁
There's also orange juice and grapefruit juice,

54
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:10,000
虽然我并不喜欢喝这些
Which, personally, as you know, I've never been a fan of.

55
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,086
但是考虑到他们富含多酚
But considering all the polyphenols

56
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,092
还有纤维蛋白  对人体无害
And the albuminoids, can't hurt.

57
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:18,091
沃尔特  你不必这么做
Walt,You didn't have to do this.

58
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:27,009
-葡萄柚汁要吗  -好的  谢谢
- Grapefruit juice?  - Yes, please. Thanks.

59
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:30,061
好了  宝贝  你要吗
There you go. Honey?

60
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:33,014
我喝橙汁  谢谢
I'll stick with orange, thank you.

61
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,068
好了  开吃吧  开吃吧
All right. Dig in, dig in.

62
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:38,089
不然薄煎饼凉了
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

63
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:43,084
好吧  我知道了  斯蒂利·丹[乐队]
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

64
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:47,027
-不是  -肯定是
- No.  - Yes, absolutely.

65
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:50,026
不  在纯音乐才能方面
No, in terms of pure musicianship,

66
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,086
他们比你知道的任何现代乐队都强
I would put them up against any current band you could name.

67
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,034
你压根不知道什么现代乐队
You wouldn't know any current bands.

68
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,088
-跑题了  -宝贝  祝你愉快
- That's besides the point.  - Have a good day, honey.

69
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,015
你也是
You too.

70
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:03,081
伯兹史卡斯  我想起一个
Boz Scaggs.There's another one.

71
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,002
管他们是谁呢
Whoever they are.

72
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:09,087
拜拜啦  谢谢你的早餐
Bye,thanks for breakfast.

73
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:12,030
不客气  让路易斯小心开车  知道吗
You're welcome. Tell Louis to drive carefully, will you?

74
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:13,006
好
All right.

75
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,064
我们儿子竟然没听说过伯兹史卡斯
Our son doesn't know who Boz Scaggs is.

76
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,082
我们做父母的真失败
We have failed as parents.

77
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,056
仔细想想  我也不知道伯兹史卡斯
Come to think of it, I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.

78
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,035
得了吧
Stop it.

79
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:29,067
把你的盘子给我  我来  我来
Give me your plate. I'll get it. I'll get it.

80
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:31,059
谢谢
Thank you.

81
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:35,011
听着
Hey, listen,

82
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:37,060
日历上标明
In the calendar section,

83
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,017
这一周
All week long,

84
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:45,063
在新墨西哥大学有个小说作者研讨会
There's a fiction writer's seminar at UNM.

85
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,047
讨论如何出版
And, you know, probably talking about how to get published

86
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:51,020
之类的事情
and that sort of thing.

87
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:56,088
总之  我以为你会去
You know, so, anyway, I thought maybe you might...

88
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,025
如果你去的话  我陪着你
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

89
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:17,055
我还想了想的那晚你问我的事情
And I was thinking about what you asked me the other night.

90
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,098
你怀疑我还有一部手机
You know, you were wondering if I had a second cell phone.

91
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,085
我一直都在想这件事
And, well, I've been thinking about that a lot,

92
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:25,083
我觉得你听到的
And I think what you heard

93
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,085
是我设的手机闹铃
Was my cell phone alarm going off.

94
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:35,019
我之前一直用闹铃当做治疗提醒
I've been using it a lot as a medication reminder to...

95
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,016
提醒我吃药
Well, remind me to take my medication.

96
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,089
诡异的是
And the weird thing is that

97
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,034
闹铃的声音跟电话铃声
The alarm sound is almost exactly the same

98
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,081
一模一样
As the regular phone ring,

99
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:51,054
说起这一点  设计得真不人性化
Which is really a poor design, if you ask me.

100
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:53,081
事情可能就是这样的
But I think that was probably it.

101
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:58,011
我试过把铃声改掉
I tried to go in and change it to a different sound,

102
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,045
改成不同的声音  但是...
Other than the phone ring, but...

103
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:03,001
这些玩意儿太复杂了
They so overcomplicate these things.

104
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:05,019
总之
Anyway,

105
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:08,040
正好我也把手机弄丢了
It was probably just as well that I lost it.

106
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:12,014
市场上应该又有新型的手机了
There's got to be a new one on the market by now.

107
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,026
如果我们一起去新墨西哥大学的话
You know, if we do this thing at UNM,

108
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:16,046
回来的路上
Maybe on the way home,

109
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:19,013
我们可以顺道给我买部新手机
We can stop by,and I can get a new cell phone.

110
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,028
斯凯勒
Skyler

111
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,020
斯凯勒
Skyler

112
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:16,050
律师事务所

113
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,007
准备好了
Ready?

114
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,037
你能帮个屁忙啊
Yo, for what might help.

115
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,090
不会又是劝说会吧
Not another intervention.

116
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,018
杰西·布鲁斯·平克曼
Jesse Bruce Pinkman,

117
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,097
根据新墨西哥不动产法47章第8条第13项
Pursuant to Section 47-8-13 of the New Mexico Real Property Code,

118
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:01,076
现通知你搬出
You are hereby given notice to vacate

119
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:06,041
位于阿尔布开克市马歌路9809号  87104住所
The premises listed as 9809 Margo,Albuquerque,87104.

120
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,071
等等  什么
Wait. What?

121
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,023
你要把我从我自己房子赶出去
You're kicking me out of my own house?

122
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,058
是你姑妈琪妮的房子
It's your aunt Ginny's house.

123
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:14,028
-她送给我了  -杰西  她可没送给你
- She gave it to me.  - She never gavet to you, Jesse.

124
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:17,051
你只是享有居住权
You were allowed residentiary privileges.

125
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:20,012
你父母才是房屋所有权持有人
Your parents have always been the property owners.

126
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,078
听着  我们之前谈过  好吗
Look, we talked about this, okay?

127
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,092
我把房子卖了  五五分成
I'd sell the house, we'd split it 50/50.

128
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:27,047
都说好了  又他妈搞什么啊
That was the deal. What the hell happened?

129
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:30,020
问题是你在房子里制毒
What happened is you're a speed manufacturer.

130
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,072
不  我没有  什么
No, I'm not. What?

131
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:36,039
杰西  缉毒局的探员过来找过你
A DEA agent came looking for you, Jesse.

132
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:38,067
他找到我们家来了
He came to our front door.

133
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,032
好吧...
Okay...

134
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:46,039
实际上我一直在协助他们
Because I've actually been helping them,

135
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:49,046
告诉你们的话就会有太多麻烦
Which I could get into a lot of trouble for telling you,

136
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,032
你们不要谢我
So you're welcome.

137
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,074
我看过地下室
I saw your basement.

138
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,099
我有点担心
I was worried,

139
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:00,027
所以我过去看了看
So I went over there and I let myself in,

140

00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:03,033
我一直在想
So I've been thinking a lot about our...

177
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,074
我们那天的谈话
Conversation we had the other day,

178
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:08,038
我终于明白
And I completely get why

179
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,093
爸爸要那么鞭策我的原因了
Dad totally tweaked off on me like that and...

180
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,094
杰西  不只是你爸爸这么想
It's not just your father, Jesse.

181
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,092
我明白  明白
I know. I know.

182
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:18,018
我只想说
I'm just saying it's a really,

183
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,079
我醒悟了不少
really big wake-up call for me,

184
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,093
所以我想跟你谈谈
Which is why I wanted to talk to you.

185
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:28,020
事实上  我一直在考虑去商业学校念书的事
I've been thinking real seriously about business school, actually,

186
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,041
所有事情都可以在电脑上搞定
And you can do the whole thing from your computer now, and...

187
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:34,054
不  妈妈  这是件好事
No, Mom, Mom. Hey, this is good.

188
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:36,093
我们用心交流
You know, we're talking,

189
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,077
好好谈谈
Starting a dialogue.

190
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:42,007
杰西  一切都晚了
The time for talking has passed, Jesse.

191
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:47,043
搞什么啊
What the hell, yo?

192
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,015
我以为你们只是想提醒我
I thought it was just a wake-up call.

193
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,075
我们把这些都放在仓库
We are putting it in storage.

194
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:53,027
等你真正成熟了  可以要回去
When you decide to grow up, you can have it back.

195
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,071
你怎么不成熟点呢  妈妈
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

196
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:59,009
琪妮想我待在这里  我才是那个一直照顾她的人
Ginny wanted me here.I was the one who took care of her.

I took her to her appointments and made her lunch every day.

198
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,005
这房子是我应得的
I earned this!

199
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:06,034
你并没有每天给她做午饭
You did not make her lunch every day.

200
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,021
你又做什么了呢
What did you do, huh?

201
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:11,016
她躺在那儿等死  你他妈在哪儿呢
She's lying there dying, and where the hell are you?

202
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,051
别跟我来劲
Don't start with me.

203
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:13,063
现在呢
Now what,

204
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:17,014
你狠心把你大儿子扫地出门
You've decided to, I don't know, make your eldest son homeless?

205
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,092
真是和谐家庭啊
Great family, Mom!

206
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,087
你为什么要这样
Why are you like this?

207
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
为什么
Why?

208
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,067
你有两串钥匙
You have two sets of keys

209
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,081
还有车库的锁

210
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:42,016
走的时候放在厨房的柜子上
Leave them on the kitchen counter when you leave.

211
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,086
不要  妈妈
No, Mom! Mom!

212
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:46,082
我能去哪儿呢
Where am I supposed to go?

213
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:50,012
宝贝  我不知道

回头是岸啊

216
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:01,018
这么做就能帮上大忙了啊
This is gonna help big time with that.

217
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,031
贱人

00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,090

小沃尔特这名字怎么了
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

242
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:28,007
别乱想了
Don't take it personally.

243
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:30,067
他只是想有自己的个性

不是给过你600块了么
I just gave you $600.

276
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:25,048
怀特先生  你没听明白

我的腿不好使

你表弟猴子  记得吗
Your cousin Badger, remember?

411
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:19,096
你来这干什么
What the hell you doing here?

412
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:21,082
臭死了你
You smell like shit.

413
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:23,058
说来话长
It's a long story.

414
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,093
我帮你把这破车修好了
So I fixed up your felonious rolling laboratory here.

415
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,062
花费750块
$750 for the repair.

416
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:31,065
加上厕所就是1000  你另外还欠我500
Make it a grand,counting the toilet,plus the $500 you already owe me,

417
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:34,040
付清后  你可以滚得远远的了
And you're good to drive on out of here to someplace far away,

418
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:36,028
滚蛋
Upwind.

419
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:40,050
事情是这样的
Here's the thing.

420
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:42,049
今天给不了钱
I can't pay you today.

421
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:44,092
但这周内可以给你  好吗
But I can pay you this week,all right?

422
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:46,066
1750块
$1,750?

423
00:33:46,098 --> 00:33:49,046
就算是1750块吧  算上
We'll make it $1,750 for, like...

424
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,079
利息
Interest.

425
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:54,049
-我以为你说话算数呢  -当然
- I thought your word was your bond.  - It totally is.

426
00:33:54,062 --> 00:33:57,096
只不过我现在手头没钱
Definitely. I just don't have the money at this particular moment.

427
00:33:58,046 --> 00:34:00,065
很快就会有了
But I will, soon.

428
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,063
我是这么想的
Here's my counter-offer.

429
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:07,023
你滚出去  这些东西卖了钱抵债
I kick you out.I take payment from your inventory.

430
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:10,022
我认识一个人专门收这种破烂
I know a guy that'll pay premium for this kind of crap.

431
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:12,001
好吧  2000块
All right. 2 grand.

432
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:15,073
给我两天时间  2000块
Two days, 2 grand.

433
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:16,087
公平交易
That's totally fair.

434
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,028
别把我东西卖了
Just don't take my cook stuff.

435
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:22,006
好吗  我就剩这些家当了
All right? That's all I got left.

436
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:24,079
求你了  好吗  我真的
Please, all right? I really...

437
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:26,095
真的需要
God, I really need

438
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,064
缓一缓
A break here.

439
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:35,017
克洛维斯  拜托了
Clovis, come on.

440
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:57,067
不知道  里面有不少东西
I don't know.There's a bunch of stuff in there.

441
00:34:58,016 --> 00:35:00,099
还有叫什么甲胺的东西
There's something called methylamine. Me... Meth...

442
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:03,056
管它叫什么呢  甲胺
However the hell you pronounce it. Methylamine.

443
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:07,014
不清楚  我掂量了下  应该是满的
I don't know. I banged on it.It sounds pretty full to me.

444
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:15,042
我靠  多少钱
Holy shit. How much?

445
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:09,004
路易斯载沃尔特上学去了
Louis took Walt to school.

446
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:12,071
我在想
I was thinking maybe...

447
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:15,077
我们可以趁机好好谈谈
This would be a good time to talk.

448
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:42,045
我曾梦见拥有一个古董修车铺
I dreamt that I owned an antique bicycle repair shop.

449
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,082
在爱尔兰
In Ireland.

450
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,066
奇怪
Weird.

451
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,065
是很奇怪
Sounds weird.

452
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:10,067
我想道歉
I wanted to apologize

453
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:13,004
为这一切
For everything.

454
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,025
我
My...

455
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:20,048
要求隐私  我
Desire for privacy. My...

456
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,055
喜怒无常
Emotional...

457
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,092
总不在家
Unavailability.

458
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,022
癌症不是所有事情的借口
Having cancer doesn't excuse all that.

459
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,070
我不是一个称职的丈夫
I haven't been a good partner to you,

460
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:39,005
为此
And for that...

461
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:42,038
我深表歉意
I'm very sorry.

462
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:46,042
我爱你
I love you.

463
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:50,027
我爱这个家
And I love this family.

464
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:53,054
我只是
And I just...

465
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,038
想确认一下
Want to make sure that...

466
00:37:57,045 --> 00:37:59,005
我们没有疏远
We don't lose contact.

467
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:08,055
谢谢
Thank you.

468
00:38:16,022 --> 00:38:17,022
我同意
I agree.

469
00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:34,041
就这么多
Is that it?

470
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:37,026
老天
God.

471
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:39,051
你还想冷战都什么时候
God, how long are you going to do this?

472
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:42,009
-什么  -冷战
- Do what?  - This.

473
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,035
不跟我说话
Not talking to me.

474
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:48,018
成天出门  也不告诉我去哪儿
Going out all day and refusing to tell me where.

475
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,084
我肯定生我的气了
You are obviously angry with me about something,

476
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:52,073
所以说出来吧
So let's talk about it.

477
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
老天
God.

478
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:05,068
我感觉到你对我不满
I feel like you're upset with me

479
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:08,020
因为你认为
Because you think that...

480
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:10,084
我有事瞒着你
I'm... up to something.

481
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:16,063
-比如  -我不知道  斯凯勒
- Like what?  - I have no idea, Skyler.

482
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:18,077
什么  我有外遇
What, that I'm having an affair?

483
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:20,042
是这个吗  你这么认为吗
Is that it? Is that what you think?

484
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:22,072
所以你才问我
Is that why you asked me about the...

485
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:26,009
是不是还有部手机  因为你认为我不忠
Some other phone? Because you think that I'm being unfaithful?

486
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:29,054
不知道
I don't know.

487
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,002
那你问啊
So ask me.

488
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:34,085
为什么
Why?

489
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:38,064
-你会告诉我吗  -是  我会
- Would you even tell me?  - Yes. I would.

490
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,050
我当然会
Of course I would.

491
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,001
没有
And no.

492
00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:45,045
我没有外遇  明白吗
I'm not. I'm not having an affair, okay?

493
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,094
我怎么才能证明给你看呢
Now, what do I do to prove that to you?

494
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:52,098
发毒誓  我对天发誓  我没有外遇
Swear an oath? My right hand to God.I'm not having an affair.

495
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,053
我知道了  沃尔特
I heard you, Walt.

496
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:57,012
你没有外遇
You're not having an affair.

497
00:39:57,084 --> 00:39:59,028
恭喜
Congratulations.

498
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,074
知道吗  恭喜你  斯凯勒
No, you know what? Congratulations to you, Skyler.

499
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:02,090
干得好
Great job.

500
00:40:03,015 --> 00:40:04,086
你搞什么  我该怎么做
What is this? What do I have to do?

501
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:06,073
我诚心跟你谈  你却 
I'm trying to talk to you, and you

502
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:08,063
好  那谈吧  沃尔特
Okay, so talk, Walt!

503
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:13,051
说点沾边的吧  别尽扯废话
Shut up and say something that isn't complete bullshit.

504
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,054
你想知道该怎么做
You want to know what you have to do?

505
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,075
你就得告诉我到底发生了什么
You have to tell me what's really going on right now.

506
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,059
就今天

507
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:25,023
别找借口
No more excuses.

508
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,008
也别道歉  别来这些
No more apologies.No more of these...

509
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,069
最后的早餐
Obvious, desperate breakfasts.

510
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:36,064
你不想跟我疏远  沃尔特
You don't want to lose contact with me, Walt?

511
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:38,011
很好
Good.

512
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:39,096
那就告诉我
Then tell me.

513
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:43,018
现在
Now.

514
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:56,089
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

515
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:10,025
我不知道你想要我说什么
What is it you want me to tell you? I don't know.

516
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:22,029
我们还没谈完呢  斯凯勒
We're not done here,Skyler!

517
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:26,071
你知道我为这个家付出了什么吗
Do you know what I've done for this family?

518
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:50,083
我真的很抱歉
Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?

519
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:52,075
你搞什么
What is wrong with you?

520
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:54,057
怎么一身蓝
Why are you blue?

521
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:56,009
天哪
Jesus.

522
00:41:56,022 --> 00:41:58,003
抱歉  先从
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts...

523
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,026
我父母的贪得无厌开始说吧
with my parents being greedy kleptomaniac douche bags.

524
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:03,067
你真的这么蠢吗
Are you actually this stupid?

525
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:05,088
没有  听着  我知道不该这么做
No, look.I know this isn't a optimal...

526
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:09,091
你竟然开着这车找到我家  还停在这条道上
To come to my house and park on my street, driving this vehicle...

527
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:13,016
我想问一下  你是不是脑子让屁给崩了
What the hell is wrong with you? I'm really asking.

528
00:42:14,072 --> 00:42:16,025
没事  我很抱歉  只是
Nothing. I'm sorry. I just

529
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:17,055
要是斯凯勒看到你了呢
What if Skyler had seen you?

530
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:20,005
那怎么办呢  到时怎么办呢  天才
What then? What was the plan then, genius?

531
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:23,013
-不知道  -知道你为什么不知道吗
- I don't know.  - You know why you don't know?

532
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:25,036
因为你不动脑子  这就是原因
Because you don't think. That's why.

533
00:42:25,067 --> 00:42:28,023
你不动脑子  甚至不知道怎么用脑子
You don't think. You never figured out how to think.

534
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,048
我道过歉了  我只想要回我的那份钱
I said I was sorry. I just need my half of the money,

535
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:32,085
然后就走人
And I will go.

536
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:34,053
你的那份
Your half?

537
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:37,064
根本没有你的那份钱
There is no your half of the money.

538
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:40,020
那些都是我的钱  明白吗
There is only my all of it.Do you understand?

539
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:43,083
我凭什么为你的冒失买单
Why should I be penalized because of your sloppiness?

540
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:46,002
听着  这样就不行  好吗
Look, that is completely uncool, all right?

541
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:49,060
-说好五五分成的搭档嘛  -什么搭档
- We agreed, 50/50 partners.  - Partners in what?

542
00:42:49,073 --> 00:42:52,067
你做了什么  我问问你
What exactly do you do here? I've been meaning to ask

543
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,076
因为一直都是我在制毒
Because I'm the producer, right?

544
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:58,079
我制毒  你不过是个瘾君子
I cook.But from what I can tell, you are just a drug addict.

545
00:42:59,028 --> 00:43:01,061
可悲的瘾君子
You are a pathetic junkie,

546
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:03,094
愚蠢到连
Too stupid to understand

547
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:06,081
最简单的操作都不会
And follow simple rudimentary instructions.

548
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,047
笨到连
Too stupid to re...

549
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:30,015
动手吧
Do it.

550
00:43:57,088 --> 00:43:59,014
尽量不要
Try not...

551
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:01,072
碰我家东西
to touch anything.

552
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,040
吃早饭吗
Want some breakfast?
