1
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,630
进展如何
How's it coming?

2
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,590
非常  非常好
Ah. Very, very well.

3
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,010
拆包裹拆到手软
It's a flurry of deliveries.

4
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,560
有种圣诞节早上拆礼物的感觉
Feels like Christmas morning.

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,130
真令人兴奋
Ah, it's exciting.

6
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,540
进展神速
It's really coming together.

7
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,310
有一件事我想说明
And I would like to point out

8
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,400
如果您对采购价格有任何疑问
that if you have any very understandable questions

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,900
那是非常可以理解的
about the price tag...

10
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,170
这声响  就是品质
That sound... quality.

11
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,950
辉瑞公司  默克公司[美国著名制药公司]
At Pfizer, at Merck,

12
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,710
用的都是这东西
that unit would be right at home.

13
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,610
所有设备都是这样
That goes for all of it.

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,380
很好
Good.

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,220
我希望你拿到你所需要的
I want you to have what you need.

16
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,760
先生  我向您致以崇高的敬意
Oh. Well, I doff my proverbial cap to you, sir.

17
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,140
你认为我们什么时候可以开工
When do you think we'll be up and running?

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,290
我估计  1个月之内
Within a month, I'd say.

19
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,060
两周
Two weeks.

20
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,770
好  两周
Uh, yeah, two weeks.

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,940
很好  非常好
Good. Very good.

22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,560
顺便说一声
By the way,

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,770
您让我检测的样品
that sample you asked me to run,

24
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,250
我测过了  品质非常好
I ran it, and it is quite good.

25
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,910
谢谢你  盖尔
Thank you very much, Gale.

26
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,280
剩下的可以交给维克多处理掉
You can give that to Victor to discard.

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,020
好的
Uh, sure.

28
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,520
那是我们的竞争对手的货吗
Is that our competition?

29
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,890
你说什么
I'm sorry?

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
那个
The, uh...

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,960
那个样品真的非常好
It really is quite good.

32
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,730
我指的是  纯度
The purity, of course, I'm speaking of,

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,570
化学范畴的"好"
speaking strictly in chemical terms.

34
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,290
迄今  我还不能确定为什么偏蓝
And I can't, as of yet, account for the blue color,

35
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,200
但是  如果那是我们的竞争对手
but, uh... if that is our competition,

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,280
那么可以说  我们的工作遇到了挑战
we have our work cut out for us, so to speak.

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,430
你没有任何竞争对手  盖尔
You don't have any competition, Gale,

38
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,160
至少在我关注范围没有
not as far as I'm concerned.

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,400
话说回来  再纯又能纯到哪里去
After all, how pure can pure be?

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,770
可以纯到匪夷所思
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.

41
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,350
福林先生  我向您保证可达96%的纯度
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you a purity of 96%.

42
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,290
我为这数字骄傲
I'm proud of that figure.

43
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,750
这个96%来之不易
It's a hard-earned figure, 96.

44
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,490
可是  那个样本的纯度是99%
However, this other product is 99,

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,990
甚至可能更纯一点
maybe even a touch beyond that.

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,700
我需要一台气相色谱仪才能确定
I'd need an instrument called a gas chromatograph to say for sure,

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,530
3个百分点听起来好像不多
but, uh, that last 3%, it may not sound like a lot,

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,940
可是  那真的是
but, uh, but it is.

49
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,070
难以逾越
It's tremendous.

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,670
难以逾越的鸿沟
It's a tremendous gulf.

51
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,140
盖尔  就我们的目的来说
Gale, for our purposes,

52
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,710
96%已经足够了
96% will do just fine.

53
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,850
请你不要为这事烦心
Please, don't let this trouble you.

54
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,920
我懂  只是...
Yeah. It's just...

55
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,100
我想知道这是谁合成出来的
I'd love to know who synthesized it

56
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,670
就是这样
is all.

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,230
一个想跟我合作的人
A man who wants to work with me.

58
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,440
训练有素的化学家  像你一样
A trained chemist, like yourself.

59
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,070
但我们不会合作的
But it won't happen.

60
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,540
我认为他不够专业
I don't consider him a professional.

61
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,100
如果他还不专业  那我简直什么都不是
If he's not, I don't know what that makes me.

62
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,750
我不是说我不能胜任
I'm not trying to talk myself out of a job.

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,350
这个人有其它方面的问题
With this person, there are other considerations.

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,190
他的货是我见过的最棒的  毫无疑问
His is the best I've ever seen, hands down.

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,530
我看到你建这个地方
And I look at this place that you've built,

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,730
投资那么大
the money you're investing,

67
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,400
不惜血本
sparing no expense.

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,310
我知道
And I know...

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,510
我知道你想要最棒的
I know that you want the best.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,360
第四季 第一集
S04E01: Box Cutter

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,970
胡安・塔布街  6353号
6353 Juan Tabo.

72
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,410
6单元
Apartment 6.

73
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,150
不  不尤班克路西边
No, no. Eubank's west.

74
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,800
在尤班克路和西班牙路之间
It's between Eubank and Spain,

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,110
离马萨特兰比较近
but Mazatlan's closest.

76
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,050
不知道  我只听到一声
I don't know. I just heard the one,

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,320
就一声  就是那种发动机逆火的声音
just the one single, like, you know, like a backfire,

78
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,750
像是卡车逆火
like a truck backfiring.

79
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,940
我就从公寓里出来
I came out of my apartment...

80
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,430
还有几个人也出来了
A couple of us came out.

81
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,230
没  没人目击
No. No, nobody saw it.

82
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,030
你们有看到什么人吗
Did you guys see anybody?

83
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,400
喂  有没有啊
Guys, did you?

84
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,560
我不知道他们是不是听得懂
I don't know if they speak English too good.

85
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,580
他们只是摇头
They're just shaking their heads.

86
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,740
我想他们没看见什么人
I don't think they saw anybody.

87
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,140
只听到一声巨响
It was just this one loud...

88
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,600
就是很响的  嘭的一声  然后就没动静了
this... this very loud pop, and that was all.

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,700
没听到争吵什么的
No arguing or like that.

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,270
你们认得路吗
So you guys good in directions there?

91
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,570
你让我...
You want me to...

92
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,510
他们打哪边来  东边还是西边
They coming east or west?

93
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,980
如果向东走
If they're heading east,

94
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,120
那他们的左手边会有一家埃克森石油
tell them there's an Exxon on their left-hand side.

95
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,990
直走就是住宅区
then it's straight residential.

96
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,790
你要我干什么  好
You want me to what? Yeah.

97
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,890
不  我在线等
No. I'll stay on the line.

98
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,360
你认得他
You know him?

99
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,030
我们都听到了枪声
We all heard this shot.

100
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,100
我说  你不应过去
Hey, I don't think you ought to go in there.

101
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,400
先生  这可是罪案现场
Mister, this is a crime scene.

102
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,240
不能碰任何东西
You don't want to touch anything.

103
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,540
先生
Mister...

104
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,480
先生  你有没听到我说话
Mister, are you listening to me?

105
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,830
你这小杂种
You little bastard.

106
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,970
开车
Drive.

107
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,570
快开车
Drive!

108
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,960
到底怎么回事
What the hell happened?

109
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,930
人死了
He's gone?

110
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,270
看着我
Look at me.

111
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,070
死了
Gone?

112
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,440
你确定
You sure?

113
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,910
死了
Gone?

114
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,980
血肉横飞
Splattered all over.

115
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,180
老天爷
Oh, Jesus.

116
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,320
靠
Oh, shit.

117
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,020
行啊
All right.

118
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,660
那么
So...

119
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,820
靠
Shit.

120
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,620
清理现场了没
All right, you do a sweep?

121
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,720
不行  有人在
I couldn't. People there.

122
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,100
有人
People?

123
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,670
有人看见他死在那儿了
He get himself seen by these people?

124
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,000
那你呢
What about you?

125
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,410
你有没有被看见
What about you?

126
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,880
有  怎么样
Yeah. So what?

127
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,410
也就一两眼
Just another looky-loo.

128
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,030
我看我最好处理下
I guess I'd better get this over with.

129
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,490
对不起  我把你吵醒了
Oh, geez, I-- I-- I woke you up.

130
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,130
-我把你吵醒了  -不不不  没事的
- I woke you up. - No, no, no. It's okay.

131
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,530
我本来也要起床了
I needed to get up anyway.

132
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,100
进来吗
Are you coming in?

133
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,740
不用了  我就这点时间能出来办事
No, no. It's kind of my only time to run errands.

134
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,370
我只是想
I just needed to-- Ah.

135
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
我
I--

136
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,910
对不起
Sorry.

137
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,410
没关系
It's okay.

138
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,920
我们一直都非常感谢你
And thank you, big time, as always.

139
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,850
账单不仅没有减少  好像反而越积越多
They seem to be getting bigger instead of smaller,

140
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,690
我也不太清楚怎么回事
and I'm not really sure what that's all about.

141
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,830
看在上帝的份上
Please, for God's sake,

142
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,770
告诉我是不是太为难你们了
tell me if this is getting to be too much for you guys.

143
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,100
没有的事  好吗
Absolutely not, okay?

144
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,500
完全没问题
It's absolutely fine.

145
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,740
好吧
Okay.

146
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,280
我没有想错吧
Does this mean what I think it means?

147
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,780
什么
What?

148
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,450
你和沃尔特
You and Walt?

149
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,780
怎么了
What?

150
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,650
他的车就停在门前车道上呢
His car's parked in the driveway.

151
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,920
谁都看得见
It's not a state secret.

152
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,820
我...我不是给你压力哈
I-- uh, all right. Okay. I'm not pressing.

153
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,690
只是
I just--

154
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,490
我觉得这挺好
I think that it's great.

155
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,660
就这样吧
That's all, all right?

156
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,400
-我走了  -好的
- I'm out of here. - Okay.

157
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,340
替我跟假装不在先生问声好
A big howdy-do to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

158
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,360
吃早餐吗
Breakfast?

159
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,760
好
Yeah.

160
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,930
我来做
Yeah? Okay.

161
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,670
想吃什么
All right. What do you want?

162
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,700
好吧   听我说
All right, look.

163
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,000
已经8点50了  所以
So I make it 10 to 9, which means--

164
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,940
闭上嘴
Shut up.

165
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,500
所以我们得在10分钟内做起来
Which means we need to start a cook in the next 10 minutes

166
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,420
才能赶上我们的计划
to keep to our schedule--

167
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,020
古斯的计划
Gus' schedule.

168
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,760
不管他现在怎么生气
And as angry as he may be,

169
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,130
我想他不会愿意这样放弃整批货
I don't believe he's willing to forfeit an entire batch.

170
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,330
那只会惹他更生气
That just might make him angrier.

171
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,330
别这样  麦克  让我们干活吧
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

172
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,440
这一切不都是为了这个
Isn't that what this whole thing is about?

173
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,310
说的没错  天才  看好我
That's right, genius. Watch me.

174
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,680
我们不会耽误进度的
We ain't missing no cook.

175
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,250
我们打烊了  打烊了
We're closed. Closed.

176
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,090
索尔・古德曼律师事务所
Saul Goodman and Associates.

177
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,690
我看看他在不在  请别挂
I'll see if he's in. Please hold.

178
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,180
索尔  斯凯勒・怀特找你
Saul, Skyler White calling.

179
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,890
索尔
Saul.

180
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,030
索尔  斯凯勒・怀特打电话来了
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

181
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,430
索尔
Saul!

182
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,910
斯凯勒・怀特
Skyler White.

183
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,310
她想干嘛
What the hell does she want?

184
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,130
我找不到他
Uh, h-he's nowhere to be found.

185
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,180
我打到他家里
I called his condo.

186
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,220
他所有号码我都打过了
I called every number I have for him.

187
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,620
我肯定他没事
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

188
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,490
你肯定
You're sure?

189
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,160
你知道他在哪
As in you know where he is?

190
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,960
我不是他保姆
Well, I'm not the man's keeper,

191
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,700
但沃尔特是个大人了
but, uh, Walt's a big boy.

192
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,840
他会出现的
He'll turn up.

193
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,970
古德曼先生  很明显出了问题
Mr. Goodman, clearly something is going on here.

194
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,240
他会把车停在我家车道上吗
I mean, why would he leave his car in my driveway?

195
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,340
现在人拼车上班
People carpool to work, right?

196
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,240
对环境有好处嘛
It's good for the environment.

197
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,410
拼车
He carpools?

198
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,070
他和人拼车去毒品实验室
He carpools to his job at a meth lab?

199
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,980
你断线了呀
Hey, whoa! Ho ho! You're breaking up there.

200
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,710
最后说什么我没听清
I didn't quite catch that last-- Whoo!

201
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,160
你今天真能侃
You're a chatty Cathy today.

202
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,080
好吧  你知道点什么吗
Okay, do you know anything?

203
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,070
什么都行  拜托你
Anything at all? Please!

204
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,660
请你帮帮忙
I'm looking for some help here.

205
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,460
听着  沃尔特没事  好吗
Look, Walter is fine, okay?

206
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,390
我百分百保证
I guarantee that 100%.

207
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,830
百分百个头
100%.

208
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,570
你有护照的吧
You got a passport, right?

209
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,780
嗯  阿尔布开克
Yeah. Uh, Albuquerque.

210
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,150
我这里是诺布山
I'm in, uh, Nob Hill.

211
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,050
我要找个锁匠
I need the number for a locksmith.

212
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,560
不知道  随便吧
I don't know. Pick one.

213
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,790
真的没办法吗
You sure there's nothing?

214
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,230
不是我不帮你
No, it's not even me.

215
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,530
法律不允许呀
It's state law, really.

216
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,530
你就没有点什么
Are you sure there isn't some sort of,

217
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
证明之类的
I don't know, um--

218
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,540
没有  真没有
No. Nothing.

219
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,430
车辆登记也许可以
Maybe, uh, a car registration.

220
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,600
上面应该有您家地址
That would have your address.

221
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,470
可我现在车都进不去
No, but I can't even get in my car.

222
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,510
我车钥匙和门钥匙挂在一起
My car keys were on the same ring.

223
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,080
天哪  我的信用卡
My God, my-- my-- my credit cards,

224
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,740
别哭  小宝贝
my-- It's all right, sweetheart.

225
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,750
我的驾照  支票簿
My driver's license, my checkbook.

226
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,580
我必须去全部注销掉
I have to start canceling all that--

227
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,870
我什么都装在钱包里了
My whole life was in that purse,

228
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,880
他就这么施施然来  轻飘飘就偷走了
and he just came, and he cut it right off my shoulder.

229
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,820
幸好我们母女没有遭其毒手
We could have been stabbed.

230
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,350
真遗憾  真的
I'm sorry, really.

231
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,990
但没有居住证明
But without proof of residency--

232
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,230
不然去我店里吧
I can take you down to my shop.

233
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,700
可以在那安坐等待  填妥警方笔录
You're welcome to wait there, file a police report.

234
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,400
真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

235
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,240
今天怎么这么倒霉
I cannot believe this day.

236
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,320
我知道  只是...
I know. It's just...

237
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,790
规定就是规定
the law.

238
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,750
天
Oh, my God.

239
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,070
我的身份证  不见了
My identification. It's gone.

240
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,610
上帝啊  别再这样了啊
Oh, God, not-- not this second.

241
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,850
打电话给药店  我...
Call the pharmacy. I--

242
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,330
你还好吧
Are you okay?

243
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,720
拜托  抱下她
Please, just-- Please, just take her.

244
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,250
帮我抱下她  拜托了
Just take her, please.

245
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,920
天哪
Oh. Oh, God.

246
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,260
别是现在啊
Not now.

247
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,830
不要啊
No. No. No.

248
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,720
你救了我的命啊  真的
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Truly.

249
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,070
好啦  宝贝
Here you go, sweetheart.

250
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,840
好了好了
Oh, there you go.

251
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,350
请问
Um, how do you, um,

252
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,210
请问账单怎么付
how do you want to deal with the bill?

253
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,450
真不幸  我的现金也被偷光光了
I-- Unfortunately, all my cash was taken, so--

254
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,190
没事  我们寄给你
That's fine. We'll mail it to you.

255
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,260
真的  知道我地址吗
Will you? You do know where I live, right?

256
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,260
先生  再次感谢  太谢谢了
Sir, again, thank you so much.

257
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,600
真的
Really. Yeah.

258
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,640
嘿  我回来了
Hey, there! I'm back!

259
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,380
物理治疗如何
How was P.T.?

260
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,710
听说效果很好
I heard it was very good.

261
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,890
是啊
Yeah.

262
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,160
我很喜欢新治疗师
I'm really liking this new therapist.

263
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,650
他跟我保持着联系
He keeps me in the loop,

264
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,300
能时时跟我通电话
always has time for a phone call.

265
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,300
很不错
I just-- I like it.

266
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,930
那么
So...

267
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,440
来说说看
tell me all about it.

268
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,010
听说你今天有新突破
I heard you broke new ground today.

269
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,710
是吗
I broke new ground?

270
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,350
他是这么说的
That's what he said.

271
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,410
说说看呢
Tell me.

272
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,720
我20分钟走了16英尺[约5米]
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes,

273
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,660
确实比昨天多了半英尺
which is up from my 15 1/2 yesterday.

274
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,760
还少拉了点在裤子上
And I had maybe this much less shit in my pants,

275
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,560
玛丽  如果你和他
so yeah, Marie, if you and him

276
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,120
还有其他美国人已秘密投票
and everybody else in America secretly took a vote

277
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,440
决定颠覆所有英文的意思
and changed the meaning of the entire English language,

278
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,140
那我想应该是突破吧
yeah, I guess I broke new ground.

279
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,310
好吧  这是比喻好不好
Well, call it a figure of speech,

280
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,320
但我确实看到了进步啊
but I am seeing progress.

281
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,520
绝对的进步
Definite progress.

282
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,220
你要买新岩石吗
You're ordering a new rock?

283
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,490
我在竞拍新矿石
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

284
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,100
这块很美
It's a nice one.

285
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,270
怎么了  确实很美啊
What? It's pretty.

286
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,840
我要上厕所
I need the thing.

287
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,540
好
Okay.

288
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,470
大的小的
Numero uno?

289
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,940
大的
Dos.

290
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,790
好
Okay.

291
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,610
那些
Those--

292
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,920
那些漂亮的小晶体  我很喜欢
Those pretty little crystals. I like that.

293
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,790
好了
Okay.

294
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,100
好吧  容我提醒一下
All right, I just want to go on record

295
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,610
我们该戴上防护罩
we should all be wearing masks.

296
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,580
都该戴上防护罩
We should be wearing masks.

297
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,680
我敢说他忘记放铝粉了
I bet he forgets the aluminum.

298
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,620
我敢担保
Guaranteed.

299
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,820
他一准忘记
Guarantee he forgets.

300
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,530
都不知道自己在做什么  是吧
Oh, you don't know what the hell you're doing, do you?

301
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,410
你刚放铝粉了
You forgot the aluminum.

302
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,530
其中第一步是
One of the first steps in the--

303
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,280
该死的
Son of a bitch.

304
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,660
好了  该谈谈盖尔・伯蒂彻了
All right, let's talk about Gale Boetticher.

305
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,930
他是个好人  好制毒师
He was a good man and a good chemist,

306
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,780
我很喜欢他
and I cared about him.

307
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,570
他本不该有如此下场的
He didn't deserve what happened to him.

308
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,540
罪不至此
He didn't deserve it at all.

309
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,910
但我还是迟早
But I'd shoot him again tomorrow

310
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,210
会亲手枪杀了他的
and the next day and the day after that.

311
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,240
如果你在我和盖尔
When you make it Gale versus me

312
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,620
或者杰西和盖尔之间择一
or Gale versus Jesse,

313
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,320
他必输无疑  就这么简单
Gale loses, simple as that.

314
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,190
这都因你而起 古斯
This is on you, Gus--

315
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,560
不因我  也不因杰西
not me, not Jesse.

316
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,860
盖尔的死是因你而起的
Gale's death is on you.

317
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,270
不然你还指望我怎么做
I mean, really, what did you expect me to do,

318
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,300
就这么认输
just simply roll over

319
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,570
让你毙了我们吗
and allow you to murder us?

320
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,260
我不该采取行动
That I wouldn't take measures--

321
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,480
甚至是极端行动来保护自己吗
extreme measures to defend myself?

322
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,550
错
Wrong!

323
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,380
再想想
Think again.

324
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,750
不管怎样
And whatever--

325
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,050
不管你在打算些什么
whatever it is you're planning there,

326
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,090
不管是什么
whatever-- whatever it is--

327
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,720
不管你想达到什么目标
the point that you're trying to make here,

328
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,930
容我提醒一句  你要知道一件事
let me-- let me suggest that you keep one thing in mind.

329
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,900
没有我们
Without us,

330
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,900
没有杰西和我
without Jesse and myself,

331
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,070
就没人能帮你制毒
you have no one to make your product.

332
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,210
当然他更不能
Certainly not him.

333
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,620
他根本不知道自己在做什么
This person doesn't know what the hell he's doing!

334
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,280
我观察了他好几周
Been watching him for weeks.

335
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,120
知道了他制毒的每个步骤
I know every step of his cook.

336
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,760
真的吗  你...
Do you really? You--

337
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,960
真的  那请告诉我
Really? Oh, so please tell me.

338
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,550
催化氢化作用是质子还是无质子反应
Catalytic hydrogenation, is it protic or aprotic?

339
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,170
因为我忘记了
Because I forget.

340
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,310
如果你的提纯不是立体定向的
And if our reduction is not stereospecific,

341
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,080
你怎么能确定成品的纯度
then how can our product be enantiomerically pure?

342
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,670
一个苯基  一个羟基
I mean, is 1 phenyl, 1 hyrdoxyl,

343
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,380
两个甲胺基
2 methylamino propane--

344
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,010
当然还包括丙烷链中
containing, of course, chiral centers

345
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,820
一号和二号碳原子这两个手性中心
at carbons number 1 and 2 on the propane chain.

346
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,220
那如果提纯至甲基苯丙胺[冰毒]
Then reduction to Methamphetamine

347
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,730
又该减去哪个手征性中心呢
eliminates which chiral center is it again?

348
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,200
因为我都忘记了
Because I forgot.

349
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,760
说啊  帮帮我啊  教授
Come on, help me out, professor!

350
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,000
古斯
Gus.

351
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,530
算了吧  我们在这里
We're here. Come on.

352
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,800
让我们干活吧
Let us work.

353
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,840
说的都是废话  那叫制毒
All his bullshit aside, it's called a cook.

354
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,210
要按照配方做每一件事
See, everything comes down to following a recipe.

355
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,880
是简单还是复杂  都无所谓
Simple, complicated, it doesn't matter.

356
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,320
步骤一成不变
The steps never change,

357
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,420
我知道所有的步骤
and I know every step.

358
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,160
这就是你想要的吗
Oh, is-- is that what you want?

359
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,490
这种劣质产品
This... short order cook?

360
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,030
这跟做汉堡不一样  老兄
You're not fpping hamburgers here, pal.

361
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,230
如果你的原材料有问题怎么办
What happens when you get a bad barrel of precursor?

362
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,180
你甚至都不会鉴别
Or how would you even know it?

363
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,880
到了夏季
And what happens in the summer

364
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,300
湿度升高
when the humidity rises

365
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,540
你的货受潮了怎么办
and your product goes cloudy?

366
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,870
你有什么防范措施呢
H-How would you guard against that?

367
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,010
古斯
Gus.

368
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,580
如果你这么做
You do this,

369
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,610
只会给你
all you'll have left

370
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,890
造成八百万元的经济损失
is an $8 million hole in the ground.

371
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,250
没有我们
This lab--

372
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,760
这间实验室  这些设备都是摆设
This equipment is useless without us.

373
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,130
没有杰西和我
Without Jesse and myself,

374
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,260
你就没有新产品
you have no new product.

375
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,200
你就没有收入
You have no income.

376
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,330
你的手下就得不到工钱
Your people out there will not be paid.

377
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,830
你的分销渠道就会崩溃
Your distribution chain collapses.

378
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,800
没有我们
Without us...

379
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,190
你会一无所有
you have nothing.

380
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,910
你杀了我  就断了财路
You kill me, you have nothing.

381
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,240
你杀了杰西  也就失去了我
You kill Jesse, you don't have me.

382
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,460
你不会这样做的
You won't do this.

383
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,780
你是个聪明人
You're too smart.

384
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,540
你承受不了这代价
You can't afford to do this.

385
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,000
求你了
Please.

386
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,980
让我们继续干活
Let us just go back to work.

387
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,480
我们就在这里
We're here.

388
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,810
让我们干活吧
Let us work.

389
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,710
我们准备好要干活了
We're ready to go to work.

390
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,380
我们接着之前的进度继续干
We'll just pick up right where we left off.

391
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,830
愣着干嘛
Well?

392
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,070
接着干活
Get back to work.

393
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,480
把这个捅放平
Let's just-- We'll just lay this down.

394
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,930
先把脚装进去
We'll put him in feet first.

395
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,560
抓着他的鞋
Grab his shoe.

396
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,330
等一等  把他抬起来
Oh. Here. Wait, wait. Just lift him up.

397
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,990
好了
There. All right.

398
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,290
就这样
Here we go.

399
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,440
天呐
God.

400
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,510
你往里推  我扶着他
If you push that way, I'll hold him in.

401
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,280
好的  准备好没
Okay, ready?

402
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,310
一
1--

403
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,620
该死的
Oh, shit!

404
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,520
好了  等一等
All right, wait. Wait.

405
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,180
别管它了
Forget that.

406
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,670
用力
Come on.

407
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,700
抬起来
Up!

408
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,810
放下
Get down.

409
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
好了
Okay.

410
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,260
氢氟酸
(HYDROFLUORIC ACID)

411
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,030
我从没用过这玩意  能管用吗
I never used this stuff. You sure it'll do the job?

412
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,920
相信我们
Trust us.

413
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,860
腐蚀剂
(CORROSIVE)

414
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,050
给你  亲  还需要什么吗
Here you go, hon. Get you anything else?

415
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,220
不用了  谢谢
Uh, no, I'm good. Thanks.

416
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,330
你好吗
How are you doing?

417
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,130
我的意思是...
No, I mean, you know--

418
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,240
你感觉还好吗
How are you doing?

419
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,350
你做了你唯一能做的
You did the only thing that you could.

420
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,150
我希望你能明白这一点
I hope you understand that.

421
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,090
有什么打算
Thoughts?

422
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,260
你是说
Got any thoughts

423
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,430
下一步我们有什么打算吗
on what our next move might be?

424
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,500
什么下一步
What next move?

425
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,160
我们的下一步
Our next move.

426
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,470
我们的下一步
Our next move,

427
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,570
鉴于古斯一旦有机会就会干掉我们
given the fact that at the first opportunity Gus will kill us.

428
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,980
难道刚才不是干掉我们的好机会吗
What, that wasn't an opportunity just now?

429
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,840
我感觉那机会他妈非常好
Seemed like a pretty damn good opportunity to me.

430
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,810
-不是的  -我说那是黄金机会
-No, no. - Golden, I would say.

431
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,510
我们为自己争取了些时间
We bought ourselves some time.

432
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,700
没错  不过...
Yes, but--

433
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,550
问题是多久
the question is how much.

434
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,650
他一定在寻找接替我的人
He'll be looking for another chemist.

435
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,790
他不会找到能够接替你的人
He's not going to find another chemist.

436
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,330
他上哪去找接替你的人呢
Where is he going to find another chemist?

437
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,600
这个人不仅要有能力
It's not just about somebody

438
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,730
使这么大的实验室正常运转
being able to run a lab that big.

439
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,500
还要值得信任
Someone he can trust,

440
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,700
他得确保这个人会守口如瓶
someone he knows will keep their mouths shut.

441
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,570
对  祝他好运
Yeah. Good luck with that.

442
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,840
估计他用了很多年才找到盖尔
Bet it took him years to find Gale.

443
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,980
他现在一定很伤心
Bet he's sorry now.

444
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,320
你确定自己没事吗
Are you sure you're okay?

445
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,760
至少现在我们能互相理解
At least now we all understand each other.

446
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,130
对吧
Right?

447
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,200
你这话什么意思
What do you mean?

448
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,030
意思是我们上了他的贼船
I mean him and us, we get it.

449
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,240
我们现在同坐一条船
We're all on the same page.

450
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,450
这又是条什么船呢
What page is that?

451
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,120
这条船上的人说...
The one that says...

452
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,120
即使我杀不了你
if I can't kill you,

453
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,030
你他妈也别想活得舒服
you'll sure as s--- wish you were dead.

454
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,640
打扰一下
Yo. Excuse me.

455
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,240
谢谢
Thanks.

456
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,460
给你
Here.

457
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:21,890
谢谢
Thanks.

458
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,720
嗨
Hi.

459
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,790
嗨
Hi.

460
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,160
我把车停到安士敦街了
It's parked over on Amsden.

461
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,980
小怀特要起床了  我怕他看到
Junior was about to get up, and he would have seen it,

462
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,540
我不想让他东问西问的
so I wanted to avoid a lot of questions.

463
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,540
很聪明
That was smart.

464
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,340
是啊
Yeah.

465
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
肯尼・罗格斯的T恤[美国歌手]
Kenny Rogers.

466
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,580
你没事吧
You okay?

467
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,820
没事
Yeah.

468
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,610
我好得很
Right as rain.

469
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,360
你带钥匙了吗
Do you have your keys?

470
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,900
带了
Yeah.

471
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,930
车停在三个街区外
Uh, it's parked three blocks down

472
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,340
马路右边
on the right.

473
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,070
好的
Yeah.
